      "['Mr. President, I should like to say first how\\npleased France is to see you personally presiding over the\\nwork of the General Assembly. Beyond your personal\\nmerits, which I acknowledge with pleasure, your election\\nunderscores the important contribution to the activities of\\nthe Organization of Portugal, a member of the European\\nUnion with which France feels particularly close.\\nThe United Nations is 50 years old. As the Heads of\\nState and Government of the European Union solemnly\\nemphasized in Cannes last June, the collective work since\\nthe Second World War has been considerable. The\\nEuropean Council on that occasion paid tribute to the\\nmajor contribution of the United Nations to this collective\\nwork and gave some examples: decolonization, the\\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\\ndisarmament, development, humanitarian aid and, of\\ncourse, the protection of human rights.\\nBut the successes of the Organization do not belong\\nsolely to history. This year has shown the vitality of the\\nUnited Nations. In Copenhagen, the social dimension of\\ndevelopment, the struggle against exclusion and for\\nproductive employment, which are both major challenges\\nfor all our societies, are now within the domain of our\\nOrganization. In Beijing, the principle of strict equality\\nbetween men and women and the right of women to\\ndecide freely about their lives in all matters have finally\\nbeen endorsed once and for all as universal values. In\\nNew York, the United Nations has begun preparatory\\nwork towards the establishment of a world criminal court.\\nThis project signals decisive progress for international\\nhumanitarian law.\\nIn Vienna, at this very moment, a conference on the\\nscourge of inhumane weapons is being held. France is\\nworking in particular to eradicate the scourge of the\\nspread of anti-personnel mines. In 1993, it decided upon\\na unilateral moratorium on the export of these mines.\\nNow the time has come to go one step farther.\\nAccordingly, I wish to confirm that France has decided to\\nadopt a unilateral moratorium on the production of all\\ncategories of anti-personnel mines. It is therefore\\n12\\n\\n\\nimposing upon itself a ban on the manufacture of such\\nweapons. France also pledges from this point on to destroy\\ngradually its stock of anti-personnel mines. I call on all\\nMember States to join with us and do the same thing.\\nThis year has also been marked by the success of the\\nNew York Review and Extension Conference of the States\\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons. This success was a major step towards\\ndisarmament. France proposes that this coming year should\\nbe a time for further progress in this domain: disarmament\\nshould be our common goal and it should encompass all\\naspects of disarmament. France calls upon the States that\\nhave not yet adhered to this Treaty to do so without further\\ndelay. The struggle against the proliferation of nuclear\\nweapons must be universal. I suggest that all the States\\nwhich have already signed this Treaty multiply concerted\\nefforts to persuade the States which have not yet signed to\\njoin them.\\nIn addition, it is important to follow through on the\\nnew objectives decided by the review Conference of the\\nNon-Proliferation Treaty in May. Among these, the most\\nimportant is the conclusion, no later than 1996, of the\\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty now being negotiated\\nin Geneva. The President of the French Republic,\\nMr. Jacques Chirac, most solemnly reaffirmed on 13 June\\n1995 France’s determination to achieve this goal and to\\nensure that the ban is total. France is pleased that other\\nnuclear Powers have in turn made the same commitment.\\nIt calls on all nuclear Powers to ensure, together with all\\nthe Member States of the Organization, that this pledge is\\nduly confirmed in the text of the future treaty and that the\\nnegotiation of the treaty is completed before the autumn of\\n1996.\\nI take this opportunity to recall the reasons that led\\nFrance to complete the programme of nuclear tests that was\\ntemporarily suspended in 1992. The final series of tests\\nnow under way has no other purpose than to enable us to\\nsign the treaty banning nuclear tests definitively. There\\nwere some who imagined and others who wished to make\\nbelieve that we might reconsider such a decision. This will\\nnot happen. Once again I repeat, this is a final test series,\\nlimited to what is strictly necessary and held under\\nconditions that have been proved to be harmless. It will\\nenable us to adhere as early as possible to the future treaty\\nbanning tests definitively.\\nThe disarmament effort must of course be directed\\ntowards reducing existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\\nSubstantial progress has been achieved over the past few\\nyears with the destruction of a significant number of\\nwarheads by the two main Powers. I would recall that\\nFrance for its part, although it has never contributed to\\nnuclear overarmament, reduced the nuclear warheads it\\nhad deployed by 15 per cent between 1991 and 1995.\\nDisarmament, however, does not apply solely to\\nnuclear weapons. With regard to chemical weapons, I call\\nupon all the Member States to ratify, or for those which\\nhave not yet done so to adhere to, the 1992 Convention\\nbanning chemical weapons. I regret that France is the\\nonly permanent member of the Security Council that has\\nratified this Convention. I hope that the other permanent\\nmembers will do so in the coming months.\\nWe must continue the effort to reduce conventional\\nforces in Europe. France took its full part in the\\nagreement on conventional force reductions in Europe. It\\nproposes that the conference which will be held in May\\n1996 to examine the implementation of this agreement\\nshould focus on compliance by all States with a treaty\\nthat is the keystone of security in Europe. This conference\\nshould also be the occasion for further progress.\\nThere remains the highly sensitive issue of the\\nConvention banning biological weapons. A serious\\nverification system has to be set up. I hope that the\\nworking group responsible for this matter in Geneva\\nquickly establishes such a system.\\nMy country cannot accept the argument put forward\\nby some that the Organization has failed in its task. We\\nreject the accusations of passivity and helplessness that\\nare sometimes made against it. Nevertheless, we cannot\\nhide the fact that the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\\nwill not be as joyful and as optimistic as we would have\\nliked. The image of the Organization in public opinion is\\nconfused, even negative at times. We should try together\\nand with a clear head to identify the reasons for such a\\nsituation. I am convinced they have nothing to do with\\nany disaffection with the Organization. Never have the\\naspirations of our peoples, especially the youth of the\\nworld, so matched the objectives of the Charter: peace\\nand disarmament, environmental protection, solidarity\\nwith the very poor, aid to those who suffer, the promotion\\nof democracy, of liberty and basic human rights, and the\\ncollective struggle against the major scourges of the end\\nof the century, namely drugs, terrorism and AIDS. In the\\nlast few years, we have witnessed the emergence of a\\nbody of common values on a world scale. These are the\\nvalues which the United Nations, like France, upholds;\\nthey are the values of peace.\\n13\\n\\n\\nIn Europe we built with our neighbours a Community\\nand then a European Union, and in doing so we turned a\\npage of a history that had so often led us to confrontation\\nwith each other. Since 1945 Europe has known a period of\\nunparalleled peace. The European Union is on the verge of\\nbeing enlarged again. France warmly welcomes the\\nforthcoming membership of its neighbours in Central,\\nEastern and Mediterranean Europe, and will do everything\\nto make it a great success. In this way, the unity of our\\ncontinent is gradually being organized.\\nThe extension of the boundaries of the European\\nUnion does not lead it to close in on itself. Quite the\\ncontrary, Europe is opening up to nearby neighbours from\\nthe South, as the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in\\nBarcelona will demonstrate. I should like to emphasize the\\nfundamental importance of that Conference. Europe also\\nwants to develop its relations with Asia; in this regard, the\\nfirst Europe-Asia Summit, scheduled for March 1996, will\\nbe a clear illustration. Lastly, Europe is deepening its\\npartnership with Russia as well as enhancing its close ties\\nwith the United States and other partners.\\nI would like to insist on the fact that the European\\nUnion, under the impetus of the French presidency, has\\nconfirmed its privileged relationship with the African,\\nCaribbean and Pacific countries in the context of the Lomé\\nConvention and its special place in North-South relations as\\nthe leading donor of development assistance.\\nIn all those areas, Europe has set the example.\\nThese values of peace are also at work in the Middle\\nEast. France welcomes the important results that have\\nalready been achieved under the peace process. I am\\nthinking of the Declaration of Principles of 13 September\\n1993 and the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 26 October\\n1994. But, above all, I am pleased to see that the principles\\nagreed upon in Oslo have at last borne fruit with the long-\\nawaited initialling of the interim agreement this Sunday.\\nWith this, a major turning-point, manifested by the\\ndeclaration of principles, has been given concrete form. The\\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace process is now irreversible. I also\\nhope that the talks between Israel and Syria will soon\\nresume and that negotiations will start between Israel and\\nLebanon so that a just and lasting peace, in accordance with\\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\\n425 (1978), be guaranteed throughout the region.\\nAs the French President, Mr. Jacques Chirac, stated at\\nthe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary at Geneva, the\\nworld needs the United Nations. And it knows it, as proved\\nby the increasing number of tasks Member States have\\nentrusted to the Organization.\\nTherefore, today’s doubts have another origin. I see\\ntwo major causes. First, the United Nations is not shown\\nsufficient respect, probably because of a lack of political\\nwill and resources. Secondly, the Organization has yet to\\ndemonstrate its ability to reform itself.\\nLet me speak of respect first. One will never be able\\nlay sufficient stress on the devastating effect of the sight\\nof the Blue Berets of the United Nations Protection Force\\n(UNPROFOR) held hostage last spring, in chains and\\nhumiliated in their dignity as men and soldiers. In\\nSomalia, in Rwanda prior to Operation Turquoise, in the\\nformer Yugoslavia since the outbreak of the conflict, the\\nsoldiers of peace had already found themselves in\\nsituations that the United Nations accepted but that no\\nMember State would ever have tolerated. It is not\\nsurprising that the image of the Organization has thereby\\nsuffered.\\nI want to make myself clear. It is not a matter of\\nquestioning the enormous work that has been\\naccomplished by the United Nations peace-keeping forces\\nsince the end of the cold war: Namibia, Cambodia,\\nMozambique, El Salvador and Haiti owe to those forces\\nprogress that would have been impossible without the\\nUnited Nations. In Somalia, the United Nations saved\\nthousands of lives. Its intervention in the countries of the\\nformer Yugoslavia made it possible to prevent the war\\nfrom spreading to Macedonia, to contain and dampen the\\nconflict within central Bosnia and Croatia, and, above all,\\nto ensure the survival of the populations in certain safe\\nareas, in Sarajevo in particular, for three years. However,\\nwe have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable\\nsuffering, to shameful operations of so-called “ethnic\\ncleansing” and to crimes against humanity, which the\\ninternational community was unable to prevent and before\\nwhich it remained passive.\\nThese tragic events have shown the dangers of\\nmixing humanitarian and military missions and the risks\\nincurred when the mission conferred by the United\\nNations is lacking in clarity. The Organization needs to\\nmake itself respected when it intervenes in a conflict. Last\\nspring, France proposed to its partners that the time to\\nreact had come at last. It suggested a change in attitude\\nand policy, with the formation of a powerfully armed\\nRapid Reaction Force. We have since begun, in liaison\\nwith the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\\ndecisive action to lift the siege of Sarajevo. This has\\n14\\n\\n\\nenabled the United Nations to recover the respect of all\\nparties.\\nThis strengthening of the United Nations capacities for\\naction has no other objective than to place force at the\\nservice of law. Only a political solution can truly settle the\\nconflicts brought about by the dissolution of the former\\nYugoslavia.\\nThat is why France, together with its partners in the\\nEuropean Union and within the Contact Group, has taken\\na clear position in favour of a settlement based on two\\nmain principles, namely, respect for international law and\\nthe support of the settlement by all the populations\\nconcerned.\\nRespect for international law entails a rejection of any\\nsolution which, imposed by force, would mean breaking\\nwith the founding principles of our Organization. Bosnia\\nand Herzegovina is a recognized State and a Member of the\\nUnited Nations. Its territorial integrity and sovereignty must\\nbe preserved. There is nothing to discuss or negotiate on\\nthose two matters.\\nThose who have chosen to break the law and who\\nhave committed the crimes of which we are all aware will\\nbe held responsible individually. The International Criminal\\nTribunal, whose creation was proposed by France in 1992,\\nmust fully exert its jurisdiction.\\nIt is also important that all the citizens of Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina should be able to assert their specific character\\nthrough representative entities. Let each entity have direct\\nmanagement of its own affairs and even be able to maintain\\nspecial relations with States whose populations share the\\nsame affinities. All this is legitimate so long as the\\nmanagement of common interests and the exercise of the\\nfunctions of sovereignty are not brought into question.\\nThe agreement on the principles of a settlement\\nproposed to the protagonists in this conflict by the Contact\\nGroup at Geneva on 8 September of this year and accepted\\nby their representatives, meets these two criteria. This is\\nwhy France has welcomed it, approves it and will support\\nit. The agreement and subsequent actions represent an\\nencouraging step, but they are only a first step. The extent\\nof what remains to be done to end the tragedy of Bosnia\\nclearly shows the major role that the United Nations will\\nhave to take. In that mission, it can rely on France’s\\nunwavering support. It must also rely on the support of the\\ninternational community. Peace will be the work of all.\\nThe decline in the respect shown the Organization is\\nevident in another domain that also affects its survival,\\nnamely, its financing. It is not normal for the Secretary-\\nGeneral of the world’s largest Organization, faced with\\nthe threat of imminent bankruptcy, to have fewer avenues\\nof recourse in dealing with his debtors than the smallest\\nof our businesses. It is not acceptable for Member\\nStates — and I am not thinking here only of those that\\nare experiencing real economic difficulties — to show\\nsuch scant respect for the Organization by ignoring the\\nlegal obligations they have freely accepted.\\nFrance would like to see the United Nations stronger\\nand more respected. For this to occur, however, it is also\\nessential that the Organization be reformed and adapted.\\nThe Secretary-General has spared no effort to open\\nthe way to reform. Under his aegis, significant progress\\nhas been made in the management of the Organization.\\nAll the debates in these past few years were undertaken\\nat his initiative and have been based on his proposals in\\nthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.\\nFrance is awaiting with the greatest interest the Agenda\\nfor Democracy, which will complete this triptych in a\\nfield in which the United Nations is called on to take the\\nleading role. The Organization has need, more than ever,\\nof its Secretary-General in order to adapt to the demands\\nof the twenty-first century.\\nHowever, it also requires the political will of its\\nMember States, and this is not sufficiently in evidence. At\\nthe opening of this fiftieth session, my wish is a simple\\none. Let us concentrate on the projects that have already\\nbeen begun so that they can be completed soon, within\\nthe coming year. France will contribute to this, and I\\nshould like in this respect to submit a few proposals.\\nOne of our main objectives will be to reach an\\nagreement on enlarging the Security Council. Enlargement\\nwill be successful only if the Council continues in a\\nlasting way to be representative of the community of\\nnations through a reasonable increase in the number of its\\nmembers.\\nI should like to reaffirm this today: the Security\\nCouncil will have to welcome Germany and Japan as\\npermanent members, as well as some major States of the\\ndeveloping world. It would also be desirable, naturally,\\nfor the Council simultaneously to be opened to some new\\nnon-permanent members.\\n15\\n\\n\\nThe negotiation on the enlargement of the Security\\nCouncil now can and should be concluded quickly. Let us\\nwait no longer. It is equally imperative for the discussion\\non United Nations financing to produce results in the next\\nfew months.\\nBut we must be honest with ourselves. This\\nnegotiation depends in part on the response to the United\\nStates’ request for a reduction in its assessed contribution\\nto the budget for peace-keeping operations. I shall not try\\nto disguise France’s genuine doubts as to the legitimacy of\\nthis request.\\nNone the less, for the higher interests of the\\nOrganization, my country is ready to examine this question\\nwithout any a priori conclusions. It does, however, set\\ncertain imperative conditions. The first condition is that any\\nnew scale must respect fully the real capacity of Member\\nStates to pay. On this point I should like once again to pay\\ntribute to your country, Mr. President. Portugal decided this\\nyear, of its own accord, to increase its contribution to the\\nbudget for peace-keeping operations. The second condition\\nis that the agreement must make it possible for the\\nOrganization to start off again on sound bases. All existing\\narrears will therefore have to be paid up. The third\\ncondition is that automatic sanctions should be applied to\\nthose who do not pay appropriately in order to prevent a\\nrecurrence of the current crisis.\\nThis is the modest price of enabling the United\\nNations to devote itself less nervously to its two principal\\nmissions: peace-keeping and development.\\nPeace-keeping is the domain of the Security Council,\\nthe only body empowered to decide on the use of force and\\nto determine the principles and mandate of operations\\ncarried out in the interest of international peace and\\nsecurity.\\nWe have to learn the lessons of the experiences of\\nrecent years. Aside from traditional peace-keeping, the\\nUnited Nations may find itself obliged, in accordance with\\nthe mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council, to\\nresort to force, within the limitations of its means, in order\\nto preserve whatever can be preserved. United Nations\\nmilitary action is often the sole recourse available to the\\ninternational community.\\nIt is therefore essential to increase the efficiency of the\\nUnited Nations in the service of peace. Among the most\\npressing matters, I wish to underline the need to set up\\ncapacities for rapid intervention, in the framework of the\\nvital process begun two years ago concerning stand-by\\nforces. I wish also to mention the need to improve the\\ncommand of operations and the interest in a still greater\\nuse of preventive diplomacy.\\nI would like to say a few words about a situation\\nthat is of grave concern to France and that calls\\nspecifically for urgent action in preventive diplomacy on\\na large scale. I am referring to the situation in the Great\\nLakes region of Africa.\\nSince the assassination of Burundi’s President,\\nMr. Ndadaye, and the unprecedented tragedy that struck\\nRwanda, this entire region has been deeply destabilized.\\nMore than 2 million Rwandans and Burundis are living\\noutside their country in terrible conditions, with the\\ndifficulties that all this entails for the host countries. The\\nabsence of lasting political solutions, the climate of\\ninsecurity and fear that is kept alive by all the extremists,\\nthe suspicion reigning on all sides, the risk of new\\ntragedies — all this compels us to address together and in\\ndepth the fundamental problems in this area, taking into\\naccount their extreme complexity and the trauma caused\\nby the genocide that has plunged Rwanda into mourning.\\nFrance remains convinced that only a comprehensive\\nregional approach that is political in character will make\\nit possible to do this. The principle of a conference on\\npeace, stability and security in the Great Lakes region is\\nnow accepted, and we welcome the recent appointment of\\na Special Representative by the Secretary-General. But\\ntime is of the essence.\\nThis conference must be carefully prepared, with the\\nactive participation of the States most directly involved\\nand interested in its success, and it must lead to the\\nestablishment of a stability pact for the African Great\\nLakes region. There are three elements that I believe to\\nbe essential in this respect: first, the adoption of\\nprinciples for the return of the refugees and for national\\nreconciliation, along with a commitment by States not to\\ntolerate any activity hostile to their neighbours on their\\nterritory; secondly, the conclusion of bilateral or\\nmultilateral agreements among the States concerned to\\nenshrine these principles and commitments and to give\\nthem substance; and, finally, the organization of a follow-\\nup mechanism under the aegis of the Security Council.\\nFrance holds the conviction that development\\nassistance is the second, or perhaps the first, raison d’être\\nof the United Nations. Here, too, the balance sheet invites\\nreflection. How can we not have questions about the\\n16\\n\\n\\nfeebleness of results, the persistence of extreme poverty, or\\nat times even famine, these crises that erase all prospects of\\ndevelopment and bring indescribable suffering to\\npopulations? How can we not have questions about the\\nreduced contributions of the world’s richest countries?\\nThese failures have gone onto the record. Now we\\nmust act, reform and take the best advantage of the\\nexperience we have acquired. The institutions of the United\\nNations and their network of representatives in the field are\\nstrong points. The development agencies have to refocus\\ntheir activity specifically on their objectives. They have to\\nset real priorities aimed at addressing real needs — in other\\nwords, first and foremost the needs of the least developed\\ncountries.\\nBut it would be shocking if, as I sometimes predict\\nwill happen, reform were boosted for the sole purpose of\\nreducing still further the contribution of the richest States\\nin the struggle against human poverty.\\nFrance, together with its partners in the European\\nUnion, hopes to bring about, through An Agenda for\\nDevelopment a mobilization for development on new\\nfoundations. The situation is too disturbing to set the\\ninterests of the States of the North and South in opposition\\nto each other. We are all bound by a higher duty: the global\\nstruggle against poverty.\\nIf, before this session comes to a close, we are able to\\nenlarge the Security Council, to place United Nations\\nfinancing on solid bases, to give the Organization the\\nmeans to intervene rapidly and effectively to maintain peace\\nand, finally, to modernize the modalities and institutions for\\ndevelopment assistance, we will truly have celebrated the\\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, above and\\nbeyond all the speech-making, in a fitting manner: by our\\nactions.\\nAllow me finally to mention a project that is\\nparticularly dear to me: to re-establish, on the occasion of\\nthis anniversary, the universality of our Organization, which\\nis reflected in the diversity of cultures and languages\\nmanifested here.\\nLinguistic pluralism is essential. It reflects the right of\\neach Member State to understand the others, but also its\\nduty to make itself understood. A draft resolution on this\\nsubject will be submitted to the Assembly; it will deal with\\nthe use of languages in the Assembly’s deliberations and in\\nthe Secretariat, and I hope it will enshrine the need to retain\\nsufficient resources to ensure the provisions of translation\\nand interpretation services. I am convinced that we will\\nreach a consensus in this regard.\\nOur Organization has deliberately taken its actions\\nfor the long term. Recent events may obscure\\nachievements that are nevertheless solid, the results of\\ncollective, patient, courageous work. But the gains are\\nthere. It is up to each of us to make them known and\\nconsolidate them so that the United Nations may continue\\nto fulfil the indispensable role entrusted to it 50 years\\nago.\\n', '“[Today more then ever we should realize that\\nwe are delegations of many countries] to the same\\nAssembly which collectively represents the interests of\\nthe world. [We must be] conscious, over and above\\nthe interests of our own country, of the interests of the\\nworld and of mankind.\\n“Each of us must first of all make an effort to\\nsink our preferences, to put aside our particular\\nsympathies and our particular antipathies.\\n“The fact is that ... we did not succeed in\\nforming a real international spirit. ... If we can create\\nthat kind of spirit, and if we can practice what I\\nregard as the two cardinal virtues ... that is to say,\\ngood faith and good will, if we are able to apply\\ncertain simple but important rules ... we shall succeed.\\n“[In an Assembly like that of the United Nations,\\nwe must make a great effort to bridge our various\\nviews.] Naturally, we must all watch over the interests\\nof our respective countries, but we shall not succeed\\nunless we are convinced that those interests must take\\ntheir place in the wider setting of the general interest.”\\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, First\\nSession, Part One, Plenary Meetings, 2nd meeting,\\np. 48)\\nWhat I have just said was not written recently. It was\\nnot written when we drafted the Belgian statement for the\\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. It was an extract\\nfrom the official statement delivered by the President of the\\nGeneral Assembly at its first session, Mr. Paul Henri\\nSpaak, then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium. His\\nappeal, issued at London on 11 January 1946, is as\\npertinent today as it was then.\\nThe United Nations was long paralysed by geopolitical\\nproblems posed by the East-West rivalry, but in recent\\nyears the Organization has been able increasingly to focus\\non all aspects of universal society. This is a philosophy that\\nmarks a change in global attitude. Human rights, sustainable\\ndevelopment, the environment, social change, population\\nquestions and the rights of women, to name but a few, have\\nbeen on the agenda of the major international conferences\\nsuccessfully organized by the United Nations. A\\nprecondition for the success of this international approach\\nis that we have the courage to break away from the old\\ntaboos and dare for the first time to discuss issues as never\\nbefore.\\nIt is impossible for me here to discuss each and\\nevery one of these items, and I shall limit myself to\\nhighlighting two of them. I realize that in doing so I may\\nbe ignoring so many other problems which are important\\nfor the immediate future of our United Nations.\\nI will start with the question of disarmament. In May\\nthis year 180 countries agreed to the extension of the\\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\\n(NPT). The five nuclear Powers pledged to reduce further\\ntheir already greatly reduced arsenals, and all other\\nparticipants solemnly promised indefinitely never to\\nacquire these weapons, which jeopardize the very\\nexistence of the Earth. Belgium urged other non-nuclear-\\nweapon States to accept the indefinite extension of the\\nNPT; I detected the firm will of all signatories to respect\\nthe Treaty in letter and spirit.\\nWe expect nevertheless that nuclear arsenals will be\\nfurther reduced. In this context we pin great hopes on the\\nprompt ratification of the START II treaty. Nuclear non-\\nproliferation should be strengthened as soon as possible\\nby the signing next year of a comprehensive test-ban\\ntreaty and by a treaty prohibiting the production of fissile\\nmaterial for military use. Those two treaties will provide\\nan indispensable complement to the NPT on the path\\ntowards the total nuclear disarmament which Belgium has\\nalways desired.\\nThe coming negotiations on a comprehensive test-\\nban treaty will show whether or not the nuclear Powers\\nare willing to accept the zero option, which to my mind\\nis the most important question for the future. In this\\ncontext Belgium deplores the recent nuclear tests and\\nfervently hopes that the other nuclear-weapon States will\\nmaintain their moratoriums. A decision not to conduct any\\nfurther tests would strongly promote the creation of a\\npropitious atmosphere for the resumption of the\\nnegotiations and their successful completion in 1996. On\\nbehalf of Belgium, I strongly urge the nuclear-weapon\\nStates to desist from all further testing.\\nI have just spoken about what are called weapons of\\nmass destruction, and obviously the threat posed by\\nnuclear and biological weapons is enormous. But we\\nshould remember that in fact it is conventional weapons\\nthat claim by far the most victims. In cooperation with\\nthe European Union, Belgium will play an active role in\\nthis field, as we have done in recent months with regard\\nto anti-personnel mines. In this regard my country has\\nbeen a pioneer, including through the adoption by its\\nParliament of forward-looking legislation prohibiting the\\n22\\n\\n\\nproduction and use of such weapons in Belgium. In the\\nUnited Nations we joined in the initiative to hold a special\\nconference in Geneva, over which my country had the\\nhonour to preside. Belgium is also aware of the dangers\\nposed by new laser weapons and their horrendous\\nconsequences. My country is prepared to adopt an activist\\npolicy in this sphere.\\nTo my mind, the next priority of the United Nations\\nis social and economic progress. The promotion and\\nprotection of human rights are an essential element of this.\\nOur own history shows that respect for human rights and\\nthe existence of a State based on law and of political\\ninstitutions elected and functioning democratically and\\nfollowing the principles of good management are absolute\\nconditions for sustainable development.\\nYet we cannot say that the results of international\\ncooperation have been altogether positive. Countries both of\\nthe South and of the North must ponder this. It makes no\\nsense to speak of peace on Earth if at the same time we\\ncannot pursue the planet’s social and economic\\ndevelopment. World-wide overall wealth has increased\\nsevenfold in the past 50 years and international trade has\\ngrown even more. But at the same time poverty has never\\nbeen greater. Furthermore, economic recession and the debt\\ncrisis have affected certain sections of the population in\\ndeveloping countries more than others. The inequalities in\\nthe distribution of income and wealth have therefore\\nbecome even greater. To combat this we need to act\\ninternationally, if only because of the globalization of the\\nworld economy. Intensive multilateral cooperation,\\nincluding cooperation between the international financial\\ninstitutions, the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\\nand the World Trade Organization will be necessary. We\\nmust also consider how the population can be involved in\\nthe preparation and implementation of reforms.\\nOf prime concern are basic needs. Real social\\ndevelopment is impossible if those are not cared for.\\nBelgium is ready to participate in this effort, as it has long\\ndone. The Belgian social security system too is marking its\\nfiftieth anniversary. That system is now being questioned,\\nfor the unemployment rate has increased dramatically,\\nthreatening the financing of the whole system. However,\\nthis system remains the best guarantee for preserving the\\nbalance between economic development and social\\ndevelopment. The State should remain responsible for the\\nprovision of the basic needs for all.\\nBelgium therefore calls for the development of a\\nmechanism which allows economic development to go hand\\nin hand with social development. Governments must\\nrespect the rights of workers and improve working\\nconditions and the security and health of the workers. The\\nfive basic social conventions of the ILO — relating to\\nminimum age for employment, the abolition of slavery,\\nfreedom of trade unions, freedom of negotiation and\\nnon-discrimination — should be internationally\\nrecognized as fundamental conventions, which would\\nprovide a concrete impetus for this.\\nThe major international conferences organized by the\\nUnited Nations have proven a useful means of studying\\nbasic questions relating to the goal of social emancipation\\nand genuine sustainable development in all countries. In\\nRio de Janeiro, old concepts of development were\\nreplaced by that of sustainable development, which has\\nfunctioned as a common theme throughout all the other\\nconferences.\\nAt the World Conference on Human Rights, in\\nVienna, a Declaration was adopted which underscored and\\nenriched the universal consensus on the respect due under\\nall circumstances to human beings. It called on all\\nMember States not only to prevent human rights\\nviolations, but also to promote those rights. For its part,\\nBelgium was the first country in Europe to adopt a law,\\nin February 1994, linking respect for human rights to\\ndevelopment cooperation.\\nThe International Conference on Population and\\nDevelopment, held at Cairo, recognized the relationship\\nbetween the individual’s reproductive and sexual health\\nand the development of every individual and every\\ncountry.\\nThe importance of the World Summit for Social\\nDevelopment, held at Copenhagen, lay above all in its\\nintegrated approach to linking the fight against poverty,\\nthe creation of jobs, and the promotion of social\\nintegration, and in the adoption on that basis of\\ncoordinated national and international strategies. It is\\ngratifying also to note the universal consensus on the\\nconcepts and issues that will deserve our attention in the\\nfuture.\\nFinally, the Fourth World Conference on Women,\\nrecently held at Beijing, stressed the role of women as\\nfull participants in the decision-making process and in\\neconomic affairs, by recognizing that genuine sustainable\\ndevelopment and true democracy will be impossible\\nwithout women.\\n23\\n\\n\\nThe United Nations should make economic and social\\ndevelopment its highest priority. It should involve world\\npublic opinion in these decisions and should ensure their\\nfollow-up and resolutely implement them in the field.\\nBelgium is prepared to reflect the programmes of action of\\nall these conferences in its future policies in the spheres of\\ndevelopment cooperation, foreign trade, international\\nfinance and in its foreign policy in general.\\nI have laid stress on two areas where the United\\nNations will play a decisive role. It will be a challenge to\\nus all; the results will not be assessed until the hundredth\\nanniversary of the United Nations. To meet our goal, it is\\nvital for us to strengthen the tool that is the United Nations.\\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies must\\nmaintain — and strengthen and adapt — their resources and\\nactivities so as to give effect to the decisions and\\nachievements of these conferences. Specifically, duplication\\nmust be avoided; rationalization and the possible merging\\nof bodies working in the same field are inevitable.\\nThe Economic and Social Council must be\\nrehabilitated; its role could be reviewed. It should be the\\nmost suitable body for staging international conferences\\nand, through the United Nations system, should coordinate\\nand supervise the implementation of conventions and\\nprogrammes. It should also spur interaction among the\\nmajor agencies and institutions of the United Nations\\nsystem.\\nThe agenda of the General Assembly must be\\nreviewed so that the Assembly can regain its original role\\nas the Organization’s supreme decision-making, deliberative\\nand policy-making body.\\nSecurity Council reform is the subject of intense\\ndebate. Without going into details, I would like to recall\\nBelgium’s view that such reform should strengthen, inter\\nalia, the Council’s capacity for action and its\\nrepresentativity. The Charter gives the Council\\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\\nsecurity on behalf of all, and for the benefit of all. Belgium\\nis convinced that the authority of Council decisions would\\nbe enhanced if troop- and equipment-contributing countries\\nwere more closely involved in the preparation of those decisions.\\nThe Organization is facing numerous financial\\nproblems. The development of new activities is often\\nhobbled by disagreements on the allocation of costs. There\\nis a growing structural rift between the capacity for\\nmultilateral action and the increasingly frequent demands\\nfor intervention.\\nHow can we prevent the United Nations from\\nbecoming a victim of its own success? One fundamental\\nobligation is that every Member State must promptly pay\\nthe contribution it has been assessed based on its ability\\nto pay. Non-payment is a serious violation of\\ncommitments, and is even more deplorable when certain\\ndelinquent contributors are also demanding a special role\\nin the Organization’s policy- and decision-making\\nprocesses.\\nFinally, we must keep working towards the new\\ninternational spirit to which I referred at the beginning of\\nmy statement. Without such a new awareness in society\\nat large, we shall never be able to make the United\\nNations into the universal instrument for peace and\\nsustainable development it must be. In that context, I\\nwant to close with another quotation from that great\\nstatesman, the first President of the General Assembly,\\nBelgian Foreign Minister Paul Henri Spaak, who as early\\nas 1943 said that\\n“The world will never be organized if each\\nState retains its full national sovereignty and the\\nabsolute right to resolve its political and economic\\nproblems as it sees fit”.\\n', 'Like previous speakers, I should like to convey to the\\nPresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly\\nour warmest congratulations on his election to the\\npresidency of the Assembly. As a representative of a\\ncountry close to us, Portugal, he will, I am certain,\\ndischarge skilfully and effectively his difficult\\nresponsibilities in leading our deliberations.\\nThe President of our Council, Mr. Javier Solana, has\\nrecently explained the position of the European Union on\\nthe work of the United Nations and on the major challenges\\nit is called upon to face. Those are also the views of my\\ndelegation. I welcome the promising prospects opening up\\nin the Balkans and the Middle East. As for Chechnya, I\\nmust, on the other hand, regret that the parties have been\\nlagging behind in restoring peace to that sorely tried region\\nin the past year.\\nIn the former Yugoslavia, dramatic developments in\\nrecent months have changed substantially the nature of the\\nconflict there. After years of civil war, atrocities and\\n“ethnic cleansing”, we now see a glimmer of hope\\nemerging. I welcome the recent agreements in Geneva\\nbetween the warring parties, as well as that on the opening\\nup of Sarajevo, which was arrived at thanks to the\\nmediation efforts and the commitment of the American\\nspecial envoy, Mr. Richard Holbrooke. I am, however, not\\nunaware of the fact that negotiations on a comprehensive\\nsettlement will be lengthy and that its implementation will\\nbe a difficult task.\\nThe Government of Luxembourg is prepared to take\\npart in the reconstruction effort as long as certain\\nconditions are met: the effective implementation of a\\ncomprehensive settlement, the implementation of a\\ndisarmament plan and respect for human rights and for\\nminorities, including the right of return.\\nIn the Middle East, negotiations for the conclusion\\nof a second agreement on the autonomy of the occupied\\nterritories have just been concluded. Mr. Rabin and Mr.\\nPeres, as well as Mr. Arafat, have shown exemplary\\ntenacity and political will, and they deserve our warmest\\ncongratulations.\\nWe are all called upon to help in the success of this\\nvast endeavour for peace now under way. My\\nGovernment has launched an important action for\\ncooperation in development in the occupied territories. It\\nwill also send observers to the forthcoming elections,\\nwhich will be the decisive test for the creation of a civil\\nand democratic society.\\nMy country notes with satisfaction the indefinite\\nextension last May of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It appeals urgently to the\\nnuclear-weapon Powers to renounce any new testing and\\nto comply with the current moratorium. Such a decision\\nwould help to create a climate favourable to the\\nconclusion in 1996 of a global treaty on the banning of\\nnuclear testing, one which is suitably verifiable.\\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women has just\\nconcluded in Beijing. My Government commends the\\nprogress achieved at that Conference. It hails the fact that,\\nfor the first time, the rights of women are recognized as\\nan integral and indivisible part of all human rights and\\nfundamental freedoms. In particular, we have in mind the\\nrecognition of the right of all women to control their\\nsexual health and their access, on an equal footing, to\\neconomic resources. The “right to be different” claimed\\nby religious fundamentalists should not hamper the\\nimplementation of these new principles.\\nThe events of some time ago led us to believe that\\nthe old bipolar world was a thing of the past and that a\\nnew world order was automatically about to succeed it.\\nUnfortunately, reality has not confirmed that hope. The\\nmultipolar world in which we live has not at all become\\nmore unified, nor more supportive, nor safer. Ethnic\\nconflicts have broken out in many parts of the world.\\nNarrow-minded nationalism has gained adherents, and\\npolitical and religious intolerance is spreading.\\nWe thought that with increased international\\ncooperation, the role of multinational organizations would\\nincrease. This has not always been the case. Often, the\\nrole of our Organization has been ill perceived or badly\\npresented to the public.\\n15\\n\\n\\nIn many cases, the image given of the United Nations\\nseems unfair. It does not take into account the many\\nconstraints under which the United Nations functions. Very\\noften, the critics are aiming at the wrong target, forgetting\\nthat it is Member States that prevent the United Nations\\neither from taking decisions or by acting, by denying it the\\nnecessary resources.\\nThe political commitment of Member States is often\\nnot commensurate with the ever-growing responsibilities of\\nthe United Nations.\\nOur Organization must then today come to grips with\\na new situation arising from the fact that most current\\nconflicts take place within the borders of a single State, and\\nno longer pit States against each other. Intervention\\nconstitutes an interference that only the United Nations can\\nlegitimize.\\nThese ethnic or religious conflicts, whose origins\\nderive from economic and social issues, are the result not\\nonly of regular armies, but of militias and clans. The\\ncivilian population is often the first victim, if not the main\\ntarget.\\nThe missions demanded of the United Nations are also\\nbecoming more and more complex, difficult and dangerous.\\nThe United Nations is called upon to maintain peace, but\\noften there is no peace to keep.\\nThe United Nations has none the less had a number of\\nsuccesses which have been important but which the media\\nhave tended to minimize, be they in Namibia, Cambodia,\\nEl Salvador, Mozambique or Haiti. In those countries, the\\nUnited Nations has helped peoples to overcome years of\\ncivil war and to channel their energies into building\\ndemocratic nations.\\nThese positive and courageous actions contrast with\\nother, rather timid reactions to conflicts that threaten the\\nlives of thousands of civilians and expose them to terrible\\nviolations of their basic rights. This was the case in\\nRwanda and was long also the case in the former\\nYugoslavia, even if the international community has\\nprovided substantial humanitarian assistance and helped to\\nease the suffering of the victims. But as long as the United\\nNations does not adopt a more defined and resolute\\napproach that would allow it to prevent such catastrophes,\\nthe effectiveness and credibility of our Organization run the\\nrisk of being called into question.\\nAs I have just emphasized with regard to the\\nconflicts in the former Yugoslavia, we must learn from\\nour failures and near-successes. My country encourages\\nefforts to provide the United Nations with its own rapid-\\nreaction capacity. But the Organization should also\\ndetermine whether increased cooperation with specialized\\nregional organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty\\nOrganization or the European Union, might not in certain\\ncases be both more effective and more economical. At\\nany rate, any new United Nations operation should be\\nestablished only on the basis of a military appraisal as\\nwell. Furthermore, the United Nations should see to it that\\nthe commanders of an operation are given sufficient\\nmilitary resources and clear, consistent political\\nguidelines.\\nOur era has witnessed spectacular developments at\\nthe national level. The concept of the State has been\\ncalled into question as both a mechanism for solving\\nnational problems and a basic element of the international\\nsystem. States find themselves increasingly threatened\\nwith disintegration, their citizens seeking to escape the\\noppression of rigid structures and demanding to become\\npart of ever more narrowly defined ethnic groups.\\nIn such a context, democracy would seem to be the\\nbest means of ensuring the viability of the State as\\nmanager of public affairs and guarantor of progress. At\\nthe national level, democracy provides the stability\\nnecessary for peace by ensuring respect for human rights\\nand allowing the population to express its will. At the\\nregional level, as in Europe, it involves States, large and\\nsmall, in joint decision-making and contributes to\\ndevelopment by encouraging cooperation and fostering\\npeace. Democratic States do not war with each other.\\nIt is thus an important duty of the international\\ncommunity to promote democracy among and within\\nStates by helping them to build a democratic system; by\\nproviding them with logistical and technical support for\\nthe organization of free elections; by promoting the\\ncreation of a public sector to guarantee the proper\\nmanagement of State affairs; and by providing the various\\nsectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate\\nthe bases of democracy. The Government of Luxembourg\\nprovides tangible support to the activities of our\\nOrganization in this sphere.\\nIn our view, the promotion of human rights is\\nanother priority area. In particular, the adoption of the\\nConvention on the Rights of the Child represents a large\\nstep forward. This Convention is a valuable instrument\\n16\\n\\n\\nthat helps to protect children from physical and mental\\nabuse. It is therefore essential for Governments that have\\nratified the Convention to adopt and implement the\\nnecessary national legislation. The General Assembly has\\ninitiated international activity on behalf of millions of street\\nchildren. My Government proposes that a similar effort be\\nundertaken to assist millions of children who work by\\nnecessity or even compulsion.\\nIt is unacceptable, indeed intolerable, that at the end\\nof the twentieth century more than a billion people live in\\nabject poverty and almost 1.5 billion men, women and\\nchildren lack sufficient food and drinking water and have\\nno access to education or the most elementary health care.\\nTo be sure, certain parts of the South today are enjoying\\nremarkable development. But others, on the African\\ncontinent in particular, seem to have been left behind by the\\nprogress from which the world economy as a whole has\\nbenefited.\\nIt is also alarming that inequalities both within\\ncountries and between the countries of the South and the\\nNorth are growing rather than shrinking, and that the richest\\nfifth of mankind owns more than four-fifths of the world’s\\nsocial product while the poorest fifth must content itself\\nwith 1.4 per cent.\\nAs concerns the developing countries, we have a duty\\nto be supportive. This support should supplement and\\nstrengthen the efforts which these countries must undertake\\nat the national level. Luxembourg has doubled its\\ndevelopment assistance in just a few years. It has\\ncommitted itself to the goal of achieving 0.7 per cent in\\nofficial development assistance before the end of the\\ncentury. It would also like to see new progress achieved in\\nreducing the debt that continues to paralyse the\\ndevelopment of many developing countries.\\nOur Organization must play a central role as the major\\ninstitution for international cooperation at the global level.\\nThis was in fact envisaged by our Charter. The Preamble\\nstresses the need to promote “the economic and social\\nadvancement of all peoples” and thereby makes\\ndevelopment one of the principal goals of our Organization.\\nFifty years after the creation of the United Nations, we\\nbelieve that the time has come to begin an in-depth review\\nof the activities and structures of the Organization in the\\neconomic and social spheres, taking into account the far-\\nreaching changes that have occurred and the growing\\nglobalization of problems. This review should take\\ncognizance of the fact that countries are being faced with\\nnew phenomena that are often diverse but are alike in\\nreaching beyond national borders.\\nI am thinking, inter alia, of such health problems as\\nAIDS or of such environmental problems as the depletion\\nof the ozone layer and global warming. There are also\\nsuch social phenomena as population growth, the pressure\\nof migration, the problem of refugees, and violations of\\nhuman rights. Other trans-border issues that are of\\nincreasing concern are drug trafficking, and new forms of\\nviolence and crime and even international terrorism.\\nWe need an effective system built on these realities\\nand better able to take into account the interests of all\\nmankind, the poorest in particular. Such a system should\\nbe able to define integrated policies and lay down clear,\\ncoherent guidelines. Cooperation between international\\nfinancial institutions and the United Nations system\\nshould be organized with this in view.\\nOnly the United Nations has the necessary\\nlegitimacy and authority for such reform. The work of\\nrenewal and clarification that has begun with the Agenda\\nfor Development is a natural component of this global\\nperspective. My country, together with its partners in the\\nEuropean Union, intends to make an active contribution\\nto the discussion to be held on this subject.\\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\\nseveral focus groups have considered the challenges\\nfacing humanity and the ability of the United Nations to\\nmeet them. In particular, I would refer to the Carlsson-\\nRamphal Commission, which submitted the report entitled\\n“On Global Governance”, and an independent working\\ngroup on the future of the United Nations which the\\nSecretary-General himself established and which delivered\\nthe results of its study last June. These two reports set\\nforth a number of potential reforms and make concrete\\nproposals, including one to create an economic security\\ncouncil.\\nI believe that these proposals are a valuable source\\nof inspiration and make an important contribution to the\\nreform work that should be pursued and intensified. I\\nattach great importance to the consideration of these\\nreports, which our Assembly has entrusted to the high-\\nlevel Working Group recently set up in the framework of\\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system.\\nBefore concluding I should like to deal with two\\nissues concerning the reform process begun by the\\nOrganization — expanding the Security Council, and\\n17\\n\\n\\nputting the finances of the United Nations on a sound\\nfooting.\\nThe Security Council today is invested with enormous\\nresponsibilities. Its decisions commit all Member States and\\nhave a decisive impact on the fate of millions of human\\nbeings. The Security Council must therefore reflect as\\nfaithfully as possible the determination of the international\\ncommunity as a whole. A Security Council more\\nrepresentative of today’s world would strengthen the\\nlegitimacy of its actions and facilitate the implementation\\nof its decisions.\\nMy Government is in favour of a balanced increase\\nthat would involve the admission to the Council of new\\npermanent and non-permanent members from both the\\nNorth and the South. In particular we would like\\npermanent-member status to be acknowledged for economic\\nPowers whose positive role in international affairs has long\\nbeen recognized.\\nThe improved representativeness of the Security\\nCouncil cannot be achieved only by remaking its\\nmembership: it also requires greater transparency in its\\ndecision-making processes. Dialogue with other Members\\nof the Organization, especially those countries that\\ncontribute troops for peace-keeping operations, must be\\nenhanced.\\nFinally, the time has come to delete from the Charter\\nreferences to “enemy States” which have not existed for a\\nlong time now.\\nEach and every one of us is aware of the seriousness\\nof the financial crisis that the Organization faces. It results\\nnot only from sums disbursed, which are relatively speaking\\nvery modest if we compare them to sums invested\\nelsewhere. It results essentially from the failure of Member\\nStates which fulfil inadequately, if at all, their obligation to\\npay their contributions to the budget of the Organization.\\nEach and every State is bound under the Charter to pay its\\ncontributions on time and in full.\\nThe Luxembourg Government is in favour of a\\nmonitoring mechanism that would ensure the proper\\nmanagement of the United Nations system.\\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\\nUnited Nations, Member States should endeavour to define\\nan approach that could confer on the Organization new\\nlegitimacy and credibility for the next century. This will\\nsucceed only if they involve in this effort representatives of\\ncivil society and, in particular, those of non-governmental\\norganizations.\\nBut in the final analysis the proper functioning and\\nefficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost\\non the political support that Member States, especially the\\nmost powerful, give to multilateralism, as well as the\\npolitical, military and financial resources they are\\nprepared to make available to international organizations.\\n\\n', 'It is with great\\npleasure that I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this\\nfiftieth session, at which we are commemorating the\\nfounding of the United Nations half a century ago. Your\\nvast experience as a statesman and scholar is our assurance\\nthat this session will be crowned with success.\\nI wish to thank your distinguished predecessor, the\\nForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, whose untiring efforts to\\nstimulate the reform process in our world Organization\\ndeserve special gratitude.\\nAustria, a member of the European Union since 1\\nJanuary 1995, fully endorses the comprehensive statement\\nmade on behalf of the Union by His Excellency Mr. Javier\\nSolana Madariaga, the Spanish Foreign Minister.\\nThe Austrian Federal Government is strongly\\ncommitted to the objectives of the United Nations Charter\\nand to the work of the Organization. The United Nations\\nhas traditionally been a priority of the Austrian foreign\\npolicy. Later this year, on 14 December, Austria will\\ncelebrate the 40th birthday of its admission to membership\\nof the United Nations.\\nLast June, our Parliament held a commemorative\\nsession on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the\\nsigning of the United Nations Charter at San Francisco. At\\nthat meeting, all political parties represented in Parliament\\npraised the achievements of the United Nations, expressed\\ntheir appreciation of the untiring efforts of the Secretary-\\nGeneral in the quest for peace, justice and development,\\nand reaffirmed the commitment of Austria to a strong and\\nvibrant United Nations.\\nAustria’s strong commitment to the world\\nOrganization is reflected in Vienna’s role as one of the\\nHeadquarters of the United Nations. The Federal\\nGovernment and the City of Vienna lend maximum support\\nto the United Nations Office as well as to the United\\nNations agencies and programmes based in our capital.\\nMore than 36,000 Austrians have served as “blue\\nhelmets” in United Nations peace-keeping operations,\\nsome of them as force commanders. More than 30 of our\\ncountrymen have lost their lives in the service of peace.\\nThis dedication to peace-keeping led the Federal\\nGovernment to organize the Vienna Seminar on\\nPeacemaking and Peace-Keeping for the Next Century,\\nwhich was opened by the Secretary-General of the United\\nNations in March of this year. The report on this\\nConference was distributed this morning.\\nMy country also attaches particular importance to\\ncivilian peace-keeping and sponsors a very successful\\ntraining programme on civilian peace-keeping and\\npeace-building. At the city of Schlaining, this programme\\nprepares election observers, human rights observers and\\nhumanitarian affairs officers for their difficult tasks.\\nConcrete proposals for improving the civilian components\\nof United Nations field missions were formulated at the\\nInternational Conference on the Preparation of Civilian\\nPersonnel of United Nations Field Missions. In addition,\\nAustria makes concerted efforts to support the United\\nNations preventive diplomacy capabilities. The Austrian\\nGovernment will provide the Secretary-General with a list\\nof personalities whose great experience will be at the\\ndisposal of the United Nations.\\nAfter the end of the cold war, new hopes were\\nvested in the Security Council. The United Nations took\\ndecisive action in response to military aggression against\\na sovereign State and undertook successful multipurpose\\npeace-keeping missions to resolve several long-standing\\nconflicts.\\nAt the same time, however, the international\\ncommunity and the Security Council were called upon to\\nhandle radically new situations. The United Nations had\\nto respond to these new types of conflict with its\\ntraditional instruments: peace-keeping missions were\\ndeployed to keep a non-existent peace. As we all know,\\nthe United Nations missions in Somalia and in Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina led to humiliation for the Organization and\\nthe international community.\\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina there is at\\nlast some realistic hope that the renewed determination of\\nthe United Nations, combined with the decisive support of\\nNATO, may bring about a durable settlement and - above\\nall - put an end to the plight of millions of innocent\\n21\\n\\n\\nvictims, of whom the citizens of Sarajevo have become the\\nsymbol. Terminating the barbaric siege of the Bosnian\\ncapital, which has lasted since the spring of 1992, carries\\nparticular significance.\\nAustria fully supports the initiative undertaken by the\\nUnited States, in the framework of the Contact Group, to\\nreach a comprehensive peace agreement that will ensure the\\nexistence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia\\nand Herzegovina and the peaceful reintegration of Eastern\\nSlavonia. We welcome the agreement on Basic Principles\\nreached in New York earlier this week as an important\\nfurther step on the long and difficult road to peace.\\nWe remain deeply concerned about the fate of\\nhundreds of thousands of refugees. Austria attaches the\\nutmost importance to the rights of all refugees and\\ndisplaced persons to freely return to their homes, as already\\nstated by the London Conference of August 1992.\\nLet me equally stress how important it is for the future\\nof the region that all crimes be brought to light and the\\nculprits punished. In this context, the War Crimes Tribunal\\nset up in The Hague can play a crucial role.\\nThe efforts of the United Nations troops and their\\ncommanders, who constantly risk their lives for the cause\\nof peace, deserve our admiration. I should like also to\\nhonour the memory of three of the main architects of the\\nUnited States peace initiative who last August became\\nvictims of the siege of Sarajevo.\\nDuring that same month, the Special Rapporteur of the\\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights, Mr.\\nTadeusz Mazowiecki, resigned over what he called\\n“the lack of consistency and courage displayed by the\\ninternational community”.\\nHis relentless efforts in pointing out and documenting\\ncrimes against humanity committed in the war have earned\\nhim our highest respect. We welcome the continuation of\\nthis important task under the eminent leadership of Ms.\\nRehn.\\nA comprehensive settlement also needs to include\\nsatisfactory solutions for minorities, not only in Croatia and\\nBosnia and Herzegovina, but also in the Federal Republic\\nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and in particular in\\nKosovo, Vojvodina and Sanjak.\\nThe prospect of a well-coordinated contribution by\\nthe world community to the reconstruction of the\\ndevastated areas and to the relaunching of economic\\nactivities could help in facilitating the prospects for peace\\nand its eventual consolidation.\\nFurthermore, Austria believes that regional arms-\\ncontrol measures will be another decisive factor in the\\neffort to secure peace and should therefore be initiated as\\nearly as possible.\\nIn the Middle East, long and arduous negotiations\\nhave now led to an important breakthrough. We applaud\\nas a major step towards final peace and cooperation in the\\nregion yesterday’s signing of the agreement between\\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on\\nthe transfer of authority.\\nToday, the main threats to peace and security are no\\nlonger predominantly attacks by one country against\\nanother sovereign State. We are faced with conflicts\\noriginating in ethnic tensions, authoritarian rule, economic\\ndespair or migratory movements. Peace and security are\\ntherefore threatened not only by violations of the code of\\nconduct among States, but increasingly by violations of\\ninternational standards on the relationship between\\ncitizens and their Governments and among different\\ngroups within countries. Our instruments for conflict\\nresolution have to be adapted to these new circumstances.\\nPart of this effort has to be an enhanced early-\\nwarning capacity of the United Nations. The earlier the\\nUnited Nations can attempt to mediate, the more likely\\nare its missions to meet with success. By increasing the\\nnumber of cases where preventive diplomacy can be used\\nsuccessfully — thus avoiding the need for military peace-\\nkeeping — an early-warning system would also be a great\\ninvestment.\\nWe also need to reinforce the capacity of the United\\nNations to assist Member States in their efforts to\\nimprove democratic structures, including the holding of\\nfree and fair elections, the full observance of human\\nrights, the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms,\\nthe strengthening of the rule of law, the fostering of\\npopular participation and accountability of Governments,\\nand the development of a prosperous civil society.\\nFurthermore, the capacity of the United Nations needs to\\nbe strengthened in order to confront new threats to peace\\nand security, such as organized crime and illicit\\ntrafficking in drugs.\\n22\\n\\n\\nAustria has always been strongly committed to\\ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We trust\\nthat the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) earlier this year\\nwill permit and encourage further substantial disarmament\\nmeasures, in particular the early conclusion of a\\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. We are confident that\\nnegotiations on the treaty will be concluded next year and\\nthat the decision by one or more of the nuclear Powers to\\nconduct additional nuclear-weapons tests — a decision that\\ncontinues to cause deep concern in Austria — will not\\ndelay the conclusion of the negotiations.\\nIn this context, allow me to reiterate the invitation of\\nthe Austrian Federal Government to establish the future\\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty organization in Vienna, and\\nto express my gratitude for the widespread support this\\nproposal has received and continues to receive.\\nThe human rights agenda has for many years been\\ndominated by the quest to establish international standards,\\nculminating in the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and\\nProgramme of Action. The recent Fourth World Conference\\non Women, held in Beijing, strongly reaffirmed the central\\nrole of these documents in the struggle for human rights\\nand their special significance in the context of the human\\nrights of women. Today, we have to concentrate on the\\nimplementation of these standards. We must take all\\nnecessary measures to fulfil our international human rights\\nobligations vis-à-vis our own peoples; we have to take a\\nfirm stand against human rights violations, wherever they\\noccur; and we must assist Governments genuinely\\ncommitted to improving the human rights situation in their\\ncountries.\\nThe ever-more urgent question of minority rights\\nneeds to be an integral part of this agenda. In this context,\\nI should like to mention that Austria and Italy together have\\narrived at an autonomous solution concerning the Austrian\\nminority in South Tyrol, Italy, which could inspire other\\nminorities and which is continuing to develop in a positive\\nand dynamic way.\\nIn order to implement the human rights agenda, we\\nmust better integrate the United Nations human rights\\nprogrammes, under the leadership of the High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights, into the mainstream of\\nUnited Nations activities. Based on the lessons learned and\\nexperiences acquired within the United Nations system, we\\nshould further improve the instrument of on-site human\\nrights monitoring. We firmly believe in the need to\\nstrengthen the United Nations programme of technical\\nassistance in the field of human rights and the technical\\ncooperation programme in the field of crime prevention\\nand criminal justice.\\nAustria also welcomes the great efforts the United\\nNations system has made to cope with humanitarian\\ncrises. As a country that has received Bosnian refugees —\\nwho number approximately one per cent of the total\\nAustrian population — Austria is particularly aware of the\\nhuman dimensions of the refugee problem. Delivering\\nhumanitarian assistance, particularly in the field of major\\nman-made catastrophes, has become an important\\nchallenge. The well-being of millions of people, be they\\nin Rwanda, Somalia or Bosnia and Herzegovina, depends\\non this assistance and the selfless work of many\\nspecialized United Nations bodies and agencies, such as\\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food\\nProgramme, UNICEF and the Department for\\nHumanitarian Affairs. Many people owe their very\\nsurvival to these organizations’ activities. Through its\\ncontributions to the European Community Humanitarian\\nOffice (ECHO), Austria shares in the support given to\\nmultilateral humanitarian programmes by their biggest\\ndonor, the European Union. My Government will do its\\nutmost to enhance direct Austrian contributions to United\\nNations programmes as part of our “burden sharing” in\\nthe field of multilateral humanitarian assistance.\\nAdapting the United Nations institutional structures\\nto today’s reality also requires reform of the Security\\nCouncil. It needs to be enlarged by those Powers whose\\ninternational influence has increased over the last 50\\nyears. However, any enlargement of the Council must\\nneither compromise its efficiency nor the opportunities of\\nsmaller countries to be represented in the Council.\\nIn our intensive deliberations about the composition\\nand procedures of the Council, we must not lose sight of\\nits primary function. Security Council resolutions are\\neffective only if they gain political relevance outside this\\nbuilding and if parties to a conflict abide by them. If\\nSecurity Council resolutions are to facilitate political\\nsolutions of international crises, they must reflect the\\npolitical will of Member States to implement them.\\nAustria welcomes the reform efforts undertaken by\\nthe Secretary-General in the area of management of the\\nUnited Nations. We hope that these initiatives will be\\nfurther pursued. We are pleased to see that the Office of\\nInternal Oversight Services has become operational. We\\nsupport the strengthening of this Office in order to further\\nenhance stringent control mechanisms and thus increase\\n23\\n\\n\\nMember States’ confidence that the Organization is\\nefficiently managed.\\nAbove all, the United Nations has to be an\\norganization in which problem-solving on all issues is\\nclosely monitored in an integrated manner. Coordination\\nand cooperation among international organizations such as\\nthe United Nations, the World Bank, the International\\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization\\n(WTO) need to be increased.\\nIn its fiftieth year, the United Nations is suffering\\nfrom a chronic financial crisis that needs to be resolved\\nurgently. A comprehensive and thorough reform is\\nnecessary. Member States must pay their assessed\\ncontributions in full, on time and without conditions.\\nUnder the co-chairmanship of Austria, the High-level\\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of\\nthe United Nations has prepared the ground for agreement\\non comprehensive reform measures. A solution to the\\nfinancial crisis will have to be based on the continued\\nrecognition of the special responsibility of the Permanent\\nMembers of the Security Council, as well as on a scale of\\nassessment reflecting today’s economic realities.\\nIn the future, the United Nations system will need\\nadditional financing mechanisms for the funding of global\\npriorities. A number of proposals have already been made,\\nincluding minimal charges on foreign exchange transactions\\nand charges to be levied on international airline travel. The\\npoint has been made that all these proposals require\\nin-depth consideration by competent bodies. Austria\\ntherefore proposes that the General Assembly should decide\\non a comprehensive study to be undertaken by various\\ncomponents of the United Nations system in collaboration\\nwith outside experts in order to advance the international\\ndiscussion on charges or taxes pertaining to such\\ninternational transactions.\\nNegotiations on the crucial issue of reform are under\\nway. Reform is possible only if Member States are truly\\ncommitted to the Organization, which is and remains the\\nonly forum to address global issues. Let us use this historic\\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly to commit\\nourselves to decisive reform in order to make our\\nOrganization fit for the challenges of the next century.\\n', 'Please accept my warm\\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. At the same time,\\nI wish to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Essy, for\\nhis successful work.\\nThe United Nations 50 years on — that makes this\\nsession of the General Assembly an event of extra-special\\nsignificance. The people of the world have high\\nexpectations. We must take stock, but in so doing we\\nmust, above all, look to the future.\\nThe representatives of 50 nations who assembled in\\nSan Francisco in the year 1945 were intended to be, as\\nPresident Truman put it, “the architects of a better world”.\\nWhat has become of their blue-print?\\nToday the family of nations has 185 members.\\nMillions of people all over the world owe their lives, their\\nfreedom and their health, their jobs and their homes, to\\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies.\\nDecolonization has been completed, apartheid has been\\novercome, and respect for human rights is no longer an\\ninternal affair. In the field of disarmament a historic\\nbreakthrough has been achieved: in May of this year the\\nproliferation of nuclear weapons was halted. That\\nconstitutes a big step towards making the world safe for\\nmankind.\\nAll these are considerable achievements which many\\ncritics of the United Nations have overlooked in this\\njubilee year, achievements on which you, in particular,\\nMr. Secretary-General, and your staff are to be\\ncongratulated. Indeed, the United Nations, in spite of\\nsome unjustified criticism, can take pride in what it has\\ndone for the cause of peace, freedom and human dignity.\\nEspecially worthy of our gratitude and appreciation\\nare the more than 68,000 United Nations troops currently\\n4\\n\\n\\nserving on missions in all regions of the world. When\\nservicemen from Asia, Africa or Latin America attend to\\nthe basic needs of refugees in Europe, in the former\\nYugoslavia, and keep the beleaguered people from starving,\\nthen that is, I believe, a marvellous indication that the “one\\nworld” is a reality. Lest we forget: nearly 5,000 of those\\ntroops, the Blue Helmets, have been killed or wounded in\\nthe line of duty. The Convention on the Safety of United\\nNations and Associated Personnel must be put into effect as\\nsoon as possible. This we owe to all those who serve the\\nUnited Nations.\\nAs we recap the events of the past year, we also have\\nto consider the huge problems now confronting the world\\nOrganization. The ability to safeguard peace: that is the\\nworld’s main criterion when judging the United Nations.\\nAnd here we have reached a critical point.\\nSomalia, Rwanda and Bosnia: these countries stand for\\ndisappointment and setbacks as well. However, I should\\nlike to make it very clear that in such cases the culprit is\\nquickly found, too quickly. Nothing is more convenient\\nthan to point to the alleged inefficiency of the United\\nNations. And nothing could be further from the truth.\\nWhen it has not been possible to help people, when\\nUnited Nations troops have been humiliated in the former\\nYugoslavia, it has in nearly every instance not been the\\nfault of the United Nations. The problems have lain in its\\nunsatisfactory mandate, in the lack of political will on the\\npart of Member States, and, unfortunately, in the shortage\\nof funds. It is we, the Members, who cause the difficulties.\\nFollowing the holding of United Nations troops as\\nhostages, the atrocities in Zepa and Srebrenica, and the\\nterrible second bloodbath in Sarajevo’s market place, the\\ncommunity of nations has demonstrated that there is a limit\\nto the amount of brutality and contempt for international\\nlaw it will tolerate. And there has to be a limit.\\nThe resolve of the United Nations and the North\\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has paid off — not\\nonly for the people of Sarajevo, who for three years have\\nbeen starving and freezing and kept under constant fire, but\\nalso for the peace process.\\nYesterday, here in New York, the parties to the\\nconflict had another meeting with the Contact Group, of\\nwhich Germany is a member. Another step forward was\\nachieved on the constitutional issue following the result\\nachieved in Geneva, and I believe this step to be a decisive\\none. For the first time since the conflict began there is a\\nrealistic prospect of a negotiated peace settlement.\\nBut I should like to warn against being over-\\neuphoric. A lot has still to be done. We shall have to put\\none stone on top of another stone in order to finish this\\nbuilding. This time none of the participants should leave\\nthe conference table until an agreement has been\\nreached — a peaceful agreement at the negotiating table,\\nand not an agreement on the basis of military actions.\\nAnyone who continues to prefer bloodshed, to prefer\\nmilitary actions, will be taking a great responsibility upon\\nhimself.\\nFrom the beginning, Germany has played an active\\npart in these efforts. We have never taken sides, nor did\\nwe ever want to take sides, against one party; rather, we\\nhave always taken up the cause of the victims, those who\\nhave been tormented and driven from their homes.\\nTo date, the German Government’s humanitarian aid\\nin the region amounts to more than 1 billion Deutsche\\nmarks. And I should like to stress strongly that we have\\nno double standards, nor should we have double\\nstandards. In the short time since August, we have\\nprovided more than 6 million marks to help Serbian\\nrefugees from Krajina.\\nMy country has contributed in various ways to all\\npeace-keeping operations. By sending medical personnel\\nto Split and deploying Tornado fighters for the first\\ntime — fighters which we have made available in\\nPiacenze, Italy — in a United Nations peace-keeping\\nmission, we have also shown that we do not merely talk\\nabout taking on more responsibility, but that we act to do\\nso.\\nWe will also meet our responsibility when it comes\\nto implementing the terms of a peace settlement — and\\nI hope that this settlement will come soon. The\\nreconstruction of Bosnia’s economy requires a genuinely\\ninternational cooperative effort, an effort on the part of\\nthe international community. The European Union — and\\nGermany, of course, as a member of the European\\nUnion — will play its part.\\nWhat lessons can and must we learn from what has\\nhappened in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia?\\nFirst, the United Nations must confine itself to doing\\nwhat is feasible. Its resources are obviously being strained\\nbeyond the limit. It cannot take on every responsibility. It\\n5\\n\\n\\ncannot solve all the problems that the world is confronted\\nwith.\\nSecondly, the extent and duration of the commitment\\nof the United Nations must be more precise, the political\\nand military objectives must be clearly defined, and there\\nmust be a realistic and, above all, coherent mandate.\\nThirdly, if the world Organization is going to\\nintervene, then it must act consistently and resolutely. There\\nmust be no repetition of what happened in Rwanda or Zepa\\nor Srebrenica.\\nFourthly, cooperation between the United Nations and\\nother organizations such as NATO must from the outset be\\nplanned in such a way that maximum speed and, above all,\\nefficiency are assured.\\nFifthly, we believe that the regional organizations must\\nplay a larger role than they have done so far. Not every\\nproblem must go straight to the United Nations. In Europe,\\nfor instance, and in other places of the world too, the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\\n(OSCE) could assume much greater responsibility.\\nHowever, we have to enable it to do so.\\nStill, let there be no illusions. Peace-keeping is not just\\na fair-weather exercise. Such missions will always be apt to\\ncreate problems for the world Organization.\\nAnd, in view of the hundreds of thousands of lives\\nthat have been saved in Somalia and Bosnia, who can argue\\nwith an easy conscience that the United Nations should not\\nhave intervened? And many of these people have already\\nbeen forgotten. What is required here is an increased peace-\\nkeeping capacity — constructive help, not destructive\\ncriticism.\\nAnd to those who over and over again have called into\\nquestion the actions of the United Nations and its peace-\\nkeeping operations, I would like to address the following\\nquestion: Is there an alternative? Who could take the place\\nof the United Nations? Indeed, Europe has not been able to\\ncope with this tragedy in its own house as well as we all\\nhoped it would.\\nBut nor should we forget the European Union’s\\nachievements in the former Yugoslavia. It paved the way\\nfor the Contact Group’s ongoing peace efforts.\\nTo my mind, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia\\nemphasizes how important and right it was for Western\\nEurope to embark on a new course after the Second\\nWorld War, a course that was directed against nationalism\\nand against the use of force. For four decades, as a result\\nof the East-West conflict, not all European nations were\\nable to follow that route of the European Community,\\ntoday’s European Union.\\nThe European Union is now striving to correct that\\nterrible aberration and bridge the gulfs that separate it\\nfrom Central and Eastern Europe. The goal is one Europe,\\na Europe in which the old big-Power politics and\\nhegemonic aspirations can never again take root.\\nThat Europe must have a legitimate place for Russia,\\nbut for Ukraine as well. The European house does not\\nconsist solely of the European Union: it has many rooms.\\nNeither of these two nations, Russia or Ukraine, should\\nbe left outside. To our Russian and Ukrainian partners\\nand friends I say: Europe needs your contribution and it\\ndoes so also in bringing peace to the former Yugoslavia.\\nHere their new partnership with the European Union and\\nNATO must — and, I add, will — prove its value.\\nMany feared that when the East-West confrontation\\ndisappeared Europe would focus exclusively on its own\\naffairs. That has not been the case. The European Union\\nis intensifying its political, economic and cultural\\ncooperation with the other regions of the world.\\nIn Asia, Africa and Latin America it is already a\\nmodel for peace, prosperity and regional integration. In\\nthe United Nations the European Union is the principal\\npartner for dialogue with the developing countries.\\nThe European Union and Germany have been\\nparticularly active in promoting peace and economic\\nrecovery in the Middle East. The recent agreement on the\\nWest Bank worked out by Yassir Arafat and Shimon\\nPeres is another important milestone on the road to lasting\\npeace in that region. I congratulate both sides on their\\ncourage and on their far-sightedness. The United States is\\nplaying a major part in this process in this region. We are\\ngrateful to them for that. Egypt has rendered an important\\ncontribution as an intermediary.\\nIncreasing the peace-keeping capacity of the United\\nNations also involves reforming the Security Council.\\nThere is now a global consensus, I believe, that this is\\nnecessary.\\nThe first steps towards reform have already been\\ntaken. More changes have been made to the Council’s\\n6\\n\\n\\nmethods of work and more transparency achieved in the\\npast two years than in the whole of the previous four\\ndecades.\\nLike many other Member States, Germany considers\\nthat the Council should have more permanent and non-\\npermanent members. The nations of Asia, Africa and Latin\\nAmerica need wider representation and I think we owe it to\\nthem. They have deserved it. The same applies to several\\ncountries with an important global role.\\nGermany, with the support of many Member States,\\nhas announced its interest in permanent membership of the\\nSecurity Council. Our willingness to assume greater\\nresponsibility, also within this framework, is for us the\\nlogical and consistent extension of our commitment to the\\nUnited Nations. This commitment is consistent with the\\nfundamental principle of our foreign policy, which is to\\ngive priority to multilateral cooperation. We have abided by\\nthat principle in pursuing European integration, and we\\nbelieve that that same principle would help us play a useful\\nrole in the Security Council.\\nThe world finds itself faced with many new conflicts\\nand challenges. It is crucial that in dealing with them we\\nshould focus our efforts more than we have done so far on\\nconflict prevention. A political solution must remain the\\nfirst option. That requires wider use of human rights\\nobservers, improvements in the United Nations early\\nwarning system, the promotion of democratization and the\\nobservation of election processes, as successfully done\\nrecently in Mozambique.\\nWe have provided a list of experienced intermediaries\\nfor the tasks of preventive diplomacy. The example of\\nMacedonia shows what the preventive deployment of\\nUnited Nations Blue Helmets can achieve. I am very happy\\nabout the agreement that has been achieved between Greece\\nand Macedonia on this extremely important issue.\\nPreventing fire can save countless lives and in any case it\\nis cheaper than putting fires out. On my recent visit to\\nRwanda I was deeply shocked, in the truest sense of the\\nword, by the atrocities that have been perpetrated there by\\nhuman beings on other human beings. If the United Nations\\nhad intervened at an early stage and resolutely, many lives\\ncould have been saved.\\nGermany has set up a substantial emergency aid\\nprogramme for Rwanda. We are trying in particular to do\\nsomething about the awful prison conditions. I myself\\nvisited prisons, in Kigali for example, and I must tell you\\nthat I have never seen anything like that in all my life.\\nUrgent remedies are needed here to ensure that one\\ninjustice is not followed by another. I travelled to Burundi\\ntoo, and I returned deeply saddened and concerned. We\\nmust not make the same mistakes in Burundi.\\nDisarmament, arms control and confidence-\\nbuilding — these are some of the main components of\\nconflict prevention. In recent years we have made the\\nkind of progress that no one would have believed possible\\nat the height of the arms race 15 years ago. The task of\\nbuttressing this breakthrough and building on the\\nachievements has acquired great political significance.\\nA few weeks ago we commemorated the fiftieth\\nanniversary of the first atomic bomb explosions over\\nHiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear weapons must never,\\nnever, be used again. They must be eliminated\\ncompletely, as required by article VI of the Treaty on the\\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That aim was\\nreaffirmed by the nuclear Powers at the New York\\nConference extending the Treaty.\\nNever has the door to a ban on every kind of\\nnuclear-test explosion been wider open than today. We\\nmust now direct all our efforts to the achievement of this\\ngoal. The Geneva negotiations must produce such a\\ncomprehensive ban by the autumn of 1996 at the latest.\\nAnti-personnel mines, too, are “weapons of mass\\ndestruction”. Day in, day out, they are taking a terrible\\ntoll on human life, and many of the victims are women\\nand, above all, innocent children. If any kind of weapon\\nmust be outlawed, then this one should be.\\nEliminating this scourge is a task of the highest\\npriority, particularly in Nicaragua, Angola, Mozambique,\\nAfghanistan, Georgia and Cambodia. Germany, together\\nwith its European partners, will continue the initiative in\\nthis direction during this session of the General\\nAssembly.\\nAt the First Review Conference of the Convention\\non certain conventional weapons, which opened in Vienna\\nthe day before yesterday, tougher export restrictions will\\nhave to be agreed on and a strict ban imposed on the use\\nof anti-personnel mines.\\nI appeal to all Members of the United Nations: In\\nthe name of humanity, accede to the Convention on\\ncertain conventional weapons as quickly as possible.\\n7\\n\\n\\nThere are good reasons why the work of the United\\nNations began with the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights. The United Nations is more than a mere gathering\\nof sovereign States. It is based on the common belief in the\\ndignity and worth of every human being, and it is my view\\nthat this must remain the focal point of all political activity.\\nUniversal Children’s Day, celebrated a week ago,\\nreminded us of the awful fate to which these, the weakest\\nmembers of society, are often exposed. The United Nations\\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) therefore needs the support of\\nevery one of us.\\nThe task of helping those people all over the world\\nwho have been persecuted and deprived of their rights must\\nremain at the top of the political agenda. Pressure from the\\ninternational community, the media, non-governmental\\norganizations and private citizens must be maintained.\\nThose who torture people and who treat human rights with\\ncontempt should not be able to sleep peacefully. To this\\nend, the High Commissioner’s position will have to be\\nstrengthened and the Centre for Human Rights better\\nequipped. People who commit war crimes must know that\\nthey will be prosecuted under international criminal law.\\nHence, Germany strongly urges the establishment of a\\npermanent international court of justice.\\nBut above all, stronger measures to protect minorities\\nare called for. “Ethnic cleansing” is no basis for peaceful\\ncoexistence, either in Europe or anywhere else.\\nMore than 27 million people are today on the move.\\nThis is one of the most dramatic events of our time. The\\ncause is not only hunger and distress, but, in most cases,\\nunfortunately, ethnic and religious fanaticism. Diversity of\\nculture and tradition is one of the world’s greatest assets,\\nand no one should seek to impose a particular model of\\nsociety on others.\\nThe fact that there exists a core of human rights which\\neveryone has to respect is quite a different matter. This was\\nreaffirmed at the Vienna Conference and should not be\\nchallenged by anyone.\\nToday the dialogue of cultures is central to the quest\\nfor peace. I have invited leading representatives of the\\nIslamic world to come to Germany in November to\\nparticipate in such a dialogue. My feeling is that we have\\nto learn to understand each other better. I have also urged\\nthat the Bosnia Contact Group closely coordinate its efforts\\nwith the Islamic Contact Group.\\nIn Germany, two and a half million Muslims are\\nliving harmoniously with the local community. In my\\nview, it is extremely important that we should develop\\ncooperation and mutual trust at the international level as\\nwell, and I am speaking as the German Foreign Minister.\\nIslam cannot be equated with terrorism or\\nfundamentalism. No new enemy stereotypes must be\\nallowed to develop. I think that we should be happy that\\nwe have been able to do away with the old ones.\\nPeace and development are inseparable. Any reform\\nof the United Nations worthy of that name should\\ntherefore encompass economic and social matters as well.\\nThis fiftieth anniversary is a unique opportunity to create\\na modern framework for a new development in\\npartnership. Work on the Agenda for Development must\\ntherefore be completed as soon as possible.\\nApart from improving and simplifying the finance\\nregime for United Nations development activities, the\\nchief concern is to coordinate and efficiently implement\\nthe results of the world conferences on the environment,\\nsocial problems, population growth and women —\\nespecially the Conference on Women that has just ended\\nin Beijing.\\nThese are the main interrelated issues of our time as\\nwe pursue the goal of peace. The planet Earth must\\nremain habitable for future generations as well. Progress\\nis possible only through equal and fair partnership\\nbetween North and South. Germany will continue to exert\\nevery effort to this end.\\nNone of this can be done unless we can come to\\ngrips with the biggest crisis confronting the United\\nNations: that of its financial situation. There is no reason\\nto deny that it has assumed dramatic proportions; one has\\nto be quite frank about this. This crisis can be overcome\\nonly if all contributors, and especially the main ones,\\nmeet their obligations punctually. Germany is the third\\nlargest contributor to the United Nations, and we pay our\\nbills. We cannot allow a situation to continue where those\\nwho pay their contributions on time are also burdened\\nwith the arrears of wealthier Members. Unless decisive\\naction is taken very soon, whole areas of activity could\\ngrind to a halt.\\nI very much welcome the confirmation by the\\nAmerican Secretary of State that the United States stands\\nby the obligations arising from its membership. The\\nUnited Nations needs an America that fulfils its\\n8\\n\\n\\nleadership role, just as the United States needs a world\\nOrganization capable of, and willing to undertake, reform.\\nHow can we overcome this financial crisis? First, we\\nmust restore the balance between the budgets for peace-\\nkeeping operations and the regular budget of the United\\nNations. We cannot allow resources for such operations to\\nbe used up to the point of depletion while at the same time\\nfunds for urgent programmes of economic or social\\ndevelopment are either non-existent or have to be cut back.\\nSecondly, it is time we found a scale of assessments\\nthat reflects Members’ actual ability to pay. You,\\nMr. Secretary-General, have made great efforts to\\nrationalize the Organization’s work, to ensure budgetary\\ndiscipline and to reduce staff. I appeal to all Member States\\nto give Under-Secretary-General Paschke the support he\\nneeds for his difficult job.\\nThe United Nations is indispensable to the task of\\nmaintaining global order and as a forum and instrument for\\ninternational cooperation, today no less than in the era after\\nthe Second World War. No other organization has the same\\nability to focus the interests and energies of the world’s\\nnations, which we believe is necessary.\\nThe United Nations is not “the others”, but us, the\\nMembers. And this Organization is only as strong and as\\nunited as we, its Members, make it.\\nHence my appeal today to the Assembly: let us stop\\nour constant vacillation between euphoria and\\ndisappointment regarding the United Nations. Let us stop\\napportioning blame, which leads nowhere. Let us rather\\nmerge vision and pragmatism, solidarity and responsibility\\nfor our own actions into a rational and realistic international\\npartnership under the aegis of the United Nations. Let us\\ngive this world Organization more clout and make it more\\nefficient and economical. Yes, we will have to slim down\\nthe United Nations. It has to save money. Let us do these\\nthings in a constructive spirit, together with, and on behalf\\nof, the United Nations. Let us give the United Nations what\\nit needs — including paying our dues.\\nThat is what the world community expects of us now,\\nand rightly so. That is the task facing the family of nations\\non the threshold of the new millennium. If the reforms fail,\\nthere will be only losers.\\n“Hope is the pillar of the world”, they say in South\\nAfrica. Fifty years ago, such a pillar of hope for mankind\\nwas erected in San Francisco. Let us do everything to\\nensure that this pillar will continue to support the hopes\\nof mankind in the next 50 years as well. Germany will\\ncontinue to play its part.\\n', 'It is a great pleasure for\\nme to see you, Sir, presiding over this very important\\nsession of the General Assembly. As a politician with a\\nlong and distinguished career, you are eminently qualified\\nto guide us ably through the crucial coming months.\\nIt goes without saying that I fully endorse the\\nintervention by Minister Solana on behalf of the European\\nUnion. At this fiftieth anniversary session of the General\\nAssembly, I would like first of all to affirm the deep\\nattachment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the\\nUnited Nations. The United Nations is the expression of\\nthe relatively new notion that nations and people\\nanywhere in the world have the same rights and are\\nbound by the same duties. For 50 years, this Organization\\nhas provided the basis for building a civilized\\ninternational community and we cannot afford to be\\ncynical about the United Nations.\\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations in\\ndealing with global challenges. It is up to us, the Member\\nStates, to make use of the Organization and to make it\\nwork. This anniversary should be an occasion neither for\\nself-congratulatory speeches nor for despondency. Rather,\\nit should inspire us to unite in a renewed effort to bring\\nthe Organization into harmony with the demands of the\\ntimes.\\nIn this age of instant communication and televised\\nimages, respect for human rights and solidarity among\\nnations can no longer be applied selectively. Aggression,\\nwar crimes and massive violations of human rights, such\\nas those in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, trigger an\\nimmediate and massive response throughout the world. It\\nis impossible for people to remain indifferent to the fate\\nof their fellow human beings anywhere — unless, of\\ncourse, they should be denied access to these means of\\ncommunication. However, the revolutionary growth of\\ncommunications has also created a gap between people’s\\ndemands for action and the limited ability of\\nGovernments and organizations to satisfy these demands.\\nThe same observation applies to national decisions\\ntouching on the security concerns of people in countries\\naround the globe; and nowadays, these concerns include\\nenvironmental, ecological and all other aspects of human\\nsecurity. Sovereignty has become restricted and\\ncircumscribed because of new global interdependencies.\\nIt is an illusion to think that in this age States can\\ncontinue to conduct their business in splendid isolation\\nwithout regard for international public opinion and\\nsensitivities. Again, as sovereignty becomes less\\nformidable a barrier and people organize themselves\\nfreely and globally in various ways, the need for global\\n12\\n\\n\\nregulation becomes more pressing. For this purpose, people\\nlook to the United Nations. But can the United Nations\\nmeet these new demands?\\nThe crises in Bosnia and Rwanda illustrate the types\\nof conflict that at present pose the biggest threat to the\\ninternational system. In many parts of the world ethnic,\\nracial and religious divides are resurfacing with a\\nvengeance. Where State structures are weak or\\ndisintegrating, those divides may become battlegrounds for\\nstruggles over land, water and other scarce resources.\\nThe response of the international community to these\\npolitical and humanitarian emergencies has often been\\ninadequate, slow or hesitant. Lack of resolve in the early\\nstages of a crisis has forced Member States to scramble\\nlater to close the gap between their acts and their words\\nand to restore lost credibility. There is a certain tendency to\\ntake words for deeds and to be satisfied with words alone.\\nLanguage is a currency whose value depends on\\ncorresponding behaviour. For the United Nations to be\\ncredible, its language must be credible, and its language can\\nonly be credible if it is matched by its deeds. These are\\nsimple, basic rules, not only in banking but also in politics.\\nUnfortunately, it can be convenient to forget these rules for\\nreasons of political expediency. In such cases a higher price\\nmust be paid at a later stage.\\nThe war in former Yugoslavia is a tragedy for its\\npeople, but it also exemplifies the dangers threatening the\\ninternational order. The fatal practice of “ethnic cleansing”\\nhas been unanimously condemned by the international\\ncommunity. Those warnings have not been heeded, and the\\nmad dream of ethnic purity is still being pursued. The\\npractice of “ethnic cleansing” has, moreover, set in motion\\na cycle of revenge and further violence.\\nThe end of the war may now come into sight, thanks\\nto forceful international intervention and a shifting balance\\non the ground. The current diplomatic initiative is designed\\nto exploit this opportunity and finally to create conditions\\nfor true peace. We should do everything in our power to\\nassist the negotiators in their mission. But for the\\ninternational community, represented by the United Nations,\\nthe question also remains of whether it should have\\nintervened earlier, and with greater decisiveness.\\nMembers of all the parties to this conflict have at\\nvarious times committed crimes and breaches of\\ninternational law. But there is a difference in the scale of\\nhuman rights violations and criminal responsibility.\\nThe Bosnian Serb side has from the beginning\\nresorted to “ethnic cleansing” and acts of terror against\\nthe civilian population as a systematic tool in its\\ncampaign, and therefore its leaders carry prime\\nresponsibility for initiating these practices.\\nThe latest and perhaps largest single crime was\\ncommitted against the population of the former Bosnian\\nenclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa. The victims were living\\nin areas declared safe by the Security Council. The Serb\\nbehaviour has been condemned by the Security Council,\\nbut the United Nations and its Member States cannot\\nescape sharing some of the blame for not living up to the\\nUnited Nations commitment. We, the Member States, had\\nconvinced ourselves — and what is more, our Bosnian\\nprotégés — that a largely symbolic United Nations\\npresence would be sufficient to deter aggression. It did\\nnot. We have been proved cruelly wrong, and as a result\\nthe populations of the enclaves paid a terrible price in\\nterms of human life and displacement at the hands of the\\nBosnian Serbs. The Netherlands, whose small contingent\\nof Blue Helmets was powerless to prevent the onslaught\\non Srebrenica, is deeply shocked by the massive\\nviolations of human rights which were committed by the\\nSerb aggressors.\\nWe share the Security Council’s deep concern about\\nthe fate of the former inhabitants of Srebrenica who have\\nnot been accounted for. There are strong indications that\\nthousands were murdered in cold blood. It is a disgrace\\nthat the Bosnian Serbs have not honoured their\\ncommitment to give immediate and full access to\\nrepresentatives of international organizations to investigate\\nthe situation of those who are missing. In the interest of\\nthe credibility of any future peace agreement, we cannot\\nacquiesce in the Bosnian Serb refusal to cooperate on this\\nand other human rights issues. We expect the same kind\\nof cooperation from the Croat and Bosniac authorities\\nwith regard to verification of reports about human rights\\nviolations in areas under their control.\\nIf similar calamities are to be prevented in the\\nfuture, we, the Security Council and the troop\\ncontributors, must ensure that the operational aspects of\\nthe Council’s resolutions have a solid foundation in\\nmilitary planning and available capabilities. This includes\\nthe political will to use those capabilities when needed.\\nTherefore, in the future no mandate should be given\\n13\\n\\n\\nbefore the means and the readiness for implementation are\\nassured.\\nSrebrenica and Zepa have also shown that\\nhumanitarian action can never be a substitute for decisive\\nmeasures against a party which perpetrates aggression and\\nmassive human rights violations. Humanitarian assistance,\\nimportant though it undoubtedly is in itself, risks being\\ntainted in the eye of the public if it is perceived as a\\nsubstitute for decisive action going to the root of the\\nproblem.\\nIn order to avoid the repetition of violent outbursts,\\nthe seeds of future wars must be eliminated. These seeds\\noften lie in the ruthless exploitation of situations of\\npotential conflict by unscrupulous politicians and local\\nwarlords. To deter such action, justice must be done and be\\nseen to be done.\\nThe establishment of the international criminal\\nTribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda may\\nprove to be an important step in the right direction, and in\\nmore than one respect. For the second time in history, after\\nNuremberg and Tokyo, the international community is\\nholding individuals responsible for their actions during\\nwartime and in the initiation of war. So, hopefully, the\\nblame for atrocities will not be put on entire peoples, which\\nwould call for massive revenge in the future, but on those\\nwho are personally and directly responsible. We hope that\\nthe creation of these Tribunals will prove to be a catalyst\\nfor the establishment of a permanent international criminal\\ncourt.\\nThe question of United Nations credibility in Bosnia\\nand Rwanda points to a broad range of issues related to\\nUnited Nations reform in the domain of peace operations,\\nthe structure and work methods of the Security Council,\\nfinance and the economic and social area. Let me comment\\nbriefly on each of these.\\nAt last year’s session of the General Assembly I noted\\nthat a more rapid response by the United Nations might\\nhave prevented the genocide in Rwanda. My suggestion\\nwas that in order to deal with emergencies like these we\\nshould consider creating a permanent brigade which could\\nbe deployed almost instantly once the Security Council had\\ntaken a decision. In the months thereafter this idea was\\nexplored in a series of consultations in New York and at an\\ninternational colloquium organized in the Netherlands.\\nThese discussions resulted in the Netherlands non-paper on\\na United Nations rapid deployment brigade, which was\\ndistributed to all Member States last April.\\nBut the idea of a United Nations brigade should be\\nseen as a contribution to the wider debate on United\\nNations peace operations. The most logical manner to\\naddress the problem of rapid response would be, in my\\nopinion, a small, standing United Nations force which\\ncould fill the time lag between a Security Council\\ndecision and the deployment of national contingents.\\nHowever, the Netherlands will support and actively\\ncontribute to any proposal that represents an intermediate\\nstep towards the longer-term objective of a United\\nNations force for rapid deployment.\\nAgainst this background, we applaud the Canadian\\nstudy on a United Nations rapid-reaction capability.\\nAmong other things, it recommends, as our colleague Mr.\\nOuellet pointed out, setting up a United Nations planning\\ncell, which could function as a mobile headquarters and\\nbe part of the vanguard concept. That is, it could be the\\nnucleus of a force composed of national contingents under\\nthe United Nations stand-by arrangements system. We\\nfully endorse this recommendation, which partly realizes\\nthe idea I raised and in due course could lead to the\\ncreation of a standing United Nations brigade. We shall\\nbe in touch with other interested Member States in order\\nto coordinate practical suggestions with a view to possible\\nfurther political action.\\nThe continued viability of United Nations peace\\noperations ultimately rests on the preservation of their\\nlegitimacy. This implies that the Security Council should\\nbe made more responsive to the views of the United\\nNations membership at large. The transparency of the\\nCouncil’s decision-making concerning peace operations\\nhas already undergone noticeable improvements.\\nNevertheless, further adjustments are called for.\\nTherefore, we support the creation of a mechanism for the\\ndiscussion of all aspects of peace operations with troop\\ncontributors.\\nThe Assembly should address with the utmost\\nurgency the critical financial situation of the United\\nNations. Without early agreement on financial\\ncontributions, there can be no basis for the necessary\\nbroad reforms. It is unacceptable that responsible Member\\nStates should carry the burden of making up for other\\nStates’ lack of financial discipline.\\nThese States are in contravention of the Charter,\\nwhich makes assessed contributions, once agreed, a\\nbinding obligation on Member States and, thus, of\\ninternational law. I strongly associate myself with the\\nEuropean Union Presidency in calling upon Member\\n14\\n\\n\\nStates to pay their contributions in full, on time and without\\nconditions.\\nThe problem can be solved only if Member States\\nparticipate actively in the current negotiations aimed at\\nstrengthening and reforming United Nations financing and\\nrefrain from unilateral actions. The Netherlands, for its part,\\nwill participate constructively in efforts to arrive at a\\nsolution.\\nThe provision of the necessary resources would also\\ngive the United Nations the possibility of dealing more\\neffectively with the promotion of the economic and social\\nadvancement of all peoples. But effective multilateral action\\non socio-economic issues is not a matter only of financial\\nresources. It will require new thinking on the future of the\\nUnited Nations. The Secretary-General indicated the right\\ndirection last year, in “An Agenda for Development”, in his\\nanalysis of the five dimensions of development: peace,\\neconomic growth, the environment, justice and democracy.\\nA number of initiatives, some from within the Organization\\nand others, such as the Carlsson report, from outside, aim\\nat strengthening, revitalizing and reforming the United\\nNations.\\nThe Netherlands recognizes the need for a thorough\\ndebate and early decisions on ways to improve the\\nperformance and accountability of the United Nations. We\\nwelcome these initiatives, including the creation of the\\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group by the General\\nAssembly. I could imagine that three years from now, in\\n1998, a ministerial conference could meet to agree on the\\nbasis for the implementation of the High-level Group’s\\nfindings.\\nIn the field of disarmament, the Netherlands attaches\\nthe highest priority to the conclusion next year of a\\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. In order to ensure that the\\nnegotiations will reach this absolutely essential objective,\\nthey should be given a strong political impulse.\\nIn this context, the Netherlands deplores the recent\\nnuclear tests and fervently hopes that the other\\nnuclear-weapon States will maintain their moratoriums. A\\ndecision not to conduct any further tests would be of great\\nbenefit to the creation of a positive climate for the\\nresumption of the negotiations and their successful\\ncompletion in 1996. Therefore, the Netherlands strongly\\nurges the nuclear-weapon States to desist from all further\\ntesting.\\nHaving said all this, I should like to close on a note\\nof hope and appreciation for what the United Nations has\\ndone and can continue to do in a number of very\\nimportant areas. I am thinking of the environment, the\\npopulation problem, human rights, the status of women,\\ndemocratization and social policy. In these areas, the\\nUnited Nations is providing the infrastructure for the\\nshaping and consolidation of a world-wide consensus and\\nfor the practical realization of what this consensus is\\nabout. Much of this happens through large-scale\\nconferences, with elaborate preparatory processes\\ninvolving the various regions of the world and a wide\\nspectrum of both governmental and non-governmental\\nactors.\\nThe women’s Conference in Beijing is clear proof of\\nthe crucial role of these meetings in bringing about a\\nglobal awareness of the issues at stake. These conferences\\nset norms and standards by which individuals and non-\\ngovernmental organizations around the world can measure\\nthe progress made by Governments and by the United\\nNations as a whole towards well-defined goals. If\\nproperly implemented and monitored they can prove to be\\ndecisive for the quality of life of future generations, and\\neven of our own, and for the credibility of our\\nOrganization.\\n', '\\ufeffThe opening of the fifty-first session of the General\\nAssembly, under the presidency of Ambassador Razili,\\ntakes place at the very moment a large number of States\\nhave entered into new commitments on the long road to\\nnuclear disarmament. Our signature, this very morning, of\\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is another\\nopportunity for Belgium to reiterate its determination to\\ncontribute to the fight against nuclear proliferation. I am\\nvery happy that this important step was taken today. It\\nshould inspire us to continue our common effort towards\\nuniversal acceptance of this new international instrument,\\nas well as an effective implementation of the international\\nverification measures it provides.\\nMy Irish colleague, Minister Dick Spring, has spoken\\non behalf of the European Union, whose objectives and\\nconcerns my country shares. Belgium endeavours to\\ncontribute substantially to the definition and implementation\\nof the policies and plans of action which the European\\nUnion intends to carry out throughout the world.\\nOur intentions before this Assembly should aim to go\\nbeyond formalities. Diplomatic language all too often hides\\nour inability to act or our lack of real compassion.\\nThe citizens of the world are fearful as we come to\\nthe end of the century. Whatever their country, people are\\nconfronted with a new anxiety, a fear of tomorrow, without\\neven realizing that these feelings are shared by the entire\\nworld. In numerous regions of the world, this is a fear of\\nphysical danger. It is a fear of external threats, aggression\\nand civil war. People die in the same way in Africa, Asia,\\nAmerica and Europe. People are killed for the same\\ndreams and mutilated in body and spirit by the barbarism\\nof modern weaponry and criminal madness born of\\nhatred.\\nYes, our world is fearful in the face of all these\\nviolations of fundamental human rights which persist\\nnotwithstanding the major conferences proclaiming our\\nhope and belief in a world where the rights of men,\\nwomen and children are respected. In such a world\\nrespect for humanitarian law need no longer be\\nquestioned.\\nThe crises felt by rich countries cannot possibly\\ncompare with the tragic consequences of war and\\nunderdevelopment. Yet the crises in Europe, in our\\nprosperous societies, also constitute a humanitarian\\ndeficit. They are also the symptoms — albeit of a\\ndifferent nature — of the same ills of modern times.\\nThese include contempt for the human person as a subject\\nof law and his reduction to mere merchandise. Today,\\nsociety everywhere is in crisis. The logic of the market\\nseems to be an exclusionary mechanism which segregates\\nsociety. As the Mexican poet Octavio Paz once wrote,\\n“The society of consumption has chilled human life\\nwith its glacial waters of selfish calculation.”\\nThis dehumanization of mankind for financial profit is the\\nprimary cause of many scourges which affect our planet,\\nirrespective of the traditions and political systems that\\ncharacterize each and every region of the world.\\nIn this respect the inertia of individuals transformed\\ninto consumers rather than dynamic actors comes to mind,\\nas do the problems of unemployment, the scourges of\\ntrade in human beings, child prostitution, organ trading,\\ndrugs and all other international criminal activities. These\\ncalamities of modern times require the international\\ncommunity to put in place effective mechanisms by which\\nwe can combat them together.\\nAs I said during the World Congress Against\\nCommercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, which was\\nheld in Stockholm last August, we must join efforts,\\nwills, means and resources to eliminate and prevent the\\nproliferation of these activities on our planet. The\\nbehaviour of those who profit from such cruel treatment\\n0\\n\\n\\nof human beings must be punished by the international\\ncommunity.\\nBelgium strongly believes that the provisions of the\\nStockholm declaration and programme of action to\\ncriminalize the sexual exploitation of children should be\\ntranslated into new treaty obligations for all States. The\\nongoing negotiations on the adoption of the optional\\nprotocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child seem\\nto me the appropriate forum to reach this goal.\\nThe protection of children in this field should equally\\ninspire us to a creative and courageous approach in other\\nUnited Nations forums where the question of international\\ncriminalization of the trade in human beings is dealt with.\\nThe Stockholm declaration and programme of action should\\ntherefore be reflected in the texts we adopt during the fifty-\\nfirst session of the General Assembly in order to strengthen\\nthe protection of the rights of the child and to condemn\\nstrongly the exploitation of children.\\nThis year, the International Day for the Abolition of\\nSlavery, 2 December 1996, will be devoted to the trade in\\nhuman beings. The whole world should endeavour to bring\\nthis horrendous scandal to an end.\\nAlthough we must tackle these social problems, our\\naction should first be introspective in order for it to be\\ncredible and efficient. How can modern society be\\nreconciled with the globalization of cultures and trade?\\nHow can the balance between the resources of rich\\ncountries and the needs of poor countries be restored?\\nThe freedom of the market cannot be absolute, lest it\\nbecome an absurdity. Our societies can only be viable if\\nthey result from a balance between the freedom of the\\nindividual and the fundamental rights of the other. The\\nunfortunate evolution of our consumer society and the\\nabandonment of humanist values could lead us — as the\\nevents of this summer in my country have shown — to a\\nsociety where murder and rape become commonplace for\\nsome and where abuse is tolerated for too long. We must\\ntherefore reconstruct our list of moral priorities and crate a\\nnew international moral code based on simple, readily\\nimplemented priorities.\\nPeace, non-violence and acceptance of the other head\\nthe list, followed by sharing and social solidarity. Man\\nneeds to be reconciled with modern times, reclaiming his\\ncentral role as subject and actor rather than object and\\nmerchandise. These values also should determine the\\nrelations between rich and poor countries. Finally, our\\nchildren should be trained to be involved, responsible\\ncitizens, conscious of the consequences of their actions on\\nsociety. I believe that the formulation of a new\\ninternational moral code is necessary if we are to\\novercome our fears and rediscover our will to act — to\\nfulfil our moral duty to take an optimistic approach to\\ninternational cooperation.\\nThis is why preventive diplomacy must be one of\\nour top priorities. Belgium neither can nor wants to\\nignore the need to turn its attention to the South, to Africa\\nin particular. We must overcome the desperation of\\ncertain situations and do everything within our means to\\nfinally allow the development of justice, social progress\\nand democracy in Africa. The situation is extremely\\ntroublesome and warrants our basing our political action\\non the essential priorities, which are, in fact, challenges\\nto be overcome. What are these challenges? to avoid new\\nfratricidal wars and genocide; to ensure that in existing\\nconflicts international humanitarian law is respected; and\\nto guarantee the reconstruction and sustainable\\ndevelopment of the continent with full respect for human\\nrights and the rule of law. We should develop our policies\\nwhile keeping in mind the fundamental relationships that\\nmust be constructed between these complementary\\nobjectives.\\nIn particular, I am thinking of former President\\nNyerere’s work in Central Africa. Our support for this\\nwork shows our willingness to cooperate with the\\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the countries\\nof the region in trying, together, to find solutions to the\\npresent crisis and to prevent hatred, death and the ravages\\nof destruction from overrunning Africa, which is dear to\\nus. Belgium supports the convening of a conference on\\nsecurity and stability in the Great Lakes region.\\nThe appointment of Mr. Ajello as Special Envoy of\\nthe European Union and of Ambassador Haesendonck as\\nBelgian Special Envoy to the region shows the\\nwillingness of the European Union and Belgium to\\naddress these concerns. For 1996 and 1997, the Belgian\\nGovernment has made financial resources available to\\nsupport the efforts under way. The survival of the\\npopulations of Burundi and Rwanda and of the Kivu\\npeople in Zaire is at stake, as well as the security and\\nprosperity of Central Africa as a whole.\\nWithin the framework of a policy of conflict\\nprevention which the European Union, in cooperation\\nwith the OAU, is trying to elaborate, the Western\\nEuropean Union (WEU), of which Belgium currently\\n1\\n\\n\\nholds the chairmanship, is also prepared to offer logistical\\nsupport to African peacekeeping operations. The WEU’s\\nfact-finding mission to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and\\nKenya returned with strong conclusions, and we intend to\\npursue the recommended course of action during our\\nchairmanship. My country, which for years has participated\\nin stand-by agreements, must review the mechanisms that\\nmight be established to improve the functioning of these\\nagreements.\\nIn this context, I wish to recall our willingness to\\nsupport logistically and financially any possible contingency\\nplanning for Burundi. Possibly in a revised form, the\\nagreements reached in Arusha last 25 June and 31 July\\nshould allow support for the normalization efforts in\\nBurundi. This option would clearly be preferred to any\\nother possible solution. The Belgian Government would like\\nto confirm here its political will to be associated with this\\npossible assistance to the security of Burundi, taking into\\naccount the modalities that are yet to be defined. However,\\nit is my deepest wish that the Burundi authorities and all\\nactive parties in that country will find the road to national\\nreconciliation and peace, to a system of government which\\nguarantees equitable representation and real protection of\\nminorities. I wish to recall that Security Council resolution\\n1072 (1996) of 30 August demands that these negotiations\\nbe initiated before 31 October.\\nBelgium’s preventive diplomacy efforts should also be\\nseen in the framework of European Union initiatives to\\npromote the development of these new societies. The\\npresidential, legislative, regional and local elections to be\\nheld in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian\\nGovernment and the European Union to show their active\\nsolidarity within the framework of collective electoral\\nassistance, which must be coordinated by the United\\nNations. In order to organize this electoral assistance, I\\nwould hope that a representative of the Secretary-General\\ncould be appointed as soon as possible. Zaire’s people have\\nthe right to participate knowledgeably in free and fair\\nelections. The international community has the obligation to\\nfacilitate the democratic process in Zaire.\\nThe Belgian Government is aware of the difficulty of\\narriving at a global approach to the problems of the South,\\nand of Central Africa in particular. We do not believe that\\nwe should impose upon other countries any system of\\ngovernment or dictate the way to achieve this. But we must\\ninsist on the concept of good governance. That is, there\\nshould be systems of government with checks and balances,\\nwhich guarantee the free exercise of the civil, political,\\nsocial and cultural rights of the people, and which enhance\\nthe development of a free and dynamic society — the\\nonly way to ensure harmonious and sustainable\\ndevelopment.\\nPreventive diplomacy is meaningless if weapons\\nremain available to extremist groups who seek, by the\\nsuppression of others and by \"ethnic cleansing\", solutions\\nto problems which should only be found in dialogue,\\nconsensus and political negotiation. The United Nations\\nRegister of Conventional Arms is an essential element in\\nmaking the arms trade transparent, a goal which my\\ncountry and others support. Since its inception, Belgium\\nhas provided the arms Register with the information\\nrequested. The extension of the Register to other\\ncategories of arms is extremely desirable. The Belgian\\nGovernment believes nevertheless that, for now, the main\\npriority should be making the Register universal. We,\\ntogether with our partners of the European Union, will\\ncontinue to concentrate our efforts on this aspect.\\nAnti-personnel mines are particularly inhumane\\nweapons. Belgium is tirelessly pursuing, in every\\ninternational forum, its objective of total and universal\\nprohibition of anti-personnel mines. The Belgian\\nGovernment regrets that very little progress has been\\nmade to date. Next October we will participate in the\\nOttawa conference which, I hope, will be able to give a\\nsignificant boost to the achievement of our objectives.\\nWhen preventive diplomacy and arms control cannot\\nkeep peace, peacekeeping missions become necessary. In\\nour view, these peacekeeping and peace-restoration\\nmissions remain one of the primary responsibilities of the\\nUnited Nations. The Belgian Government has taken part\\nin various peacekeeping operations and is assuming\\nmilitary leadership of the United Nations Transitional\\nAdministration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\\nSirmium (UNTAES). I am convinced that the success of\\nUNTAES will contribute significantly to the\\nre-establishment of a society which we hope will be\\npluralist, tolerant and peaceful. Last year, the General\\nFramework Agreement, negotiated in Dayton and signed\\nin Paris led to the establishment, under United Nations\\nauspices, of the NATO-led implementation force (IFOR).\\nMy country is, with its partners, part of this peacekeeping\\noperation whose role is to be a force for solidarity,\\nreconstruction and hope for a new Europe. The recent\\nelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina allow us to look\\ntoward the future with a degree of optimism.\\nThe increase in number and size of peacekeeping\\noperations that has characterized the recent history of our\\n2\\n\\n\\nOrganization has allowed the development of political\\nconcepts and given a new dimension to international\\nmilitary cooperation. It has also allowed for positive and\\nnecessary developments in the field of international\\nhumanitarian law. The Belgian Government hopes that the\\nrecent agreement between the International Committee of\\nthe Red Cross (ICRC) and the Secretariat on the\\napplicability of humanitarian law to peacekeeping\\noperations will permit a swift adoption of the lines of\\nconduct to this effect. This is indispensable and should be\\nwelcomed unreservedly by all troop-contributing countries.\\nFor peacekeeping operations to succeed they must be\\nfollowed up by rehabilitation programmes. Obviously, these\\nprogrammes, which are meant to eliminate the potential\\ncauses of new conflicts, must be developed in a climate of\\npeace that ensures respect for human rights.\\nThis fin de siècle is characterized by the size and\\nurgency of rehabilitation operations and by humanitarian\\nintervention and aid. Despite exceptional crises situations,\\nwe must not forget the importance of implementing global\\nand sustainable development. The major thematic\\nconferences of the United Nations were designed to\\nestablish a strategy for the growth of the human being. I\\nbelieve that the effective implementation of the moral and\\npolitical decisions taken at these major conferences is fully\\nin keeping with the new moral code that I hope to see\\nemerge.\\nIn this context, I would like to mention the efforts to\\nreform United Nations institutions and, in particular, the\\nquest for efficiency and sound financial management that\\nshould be the watchword of the functioning of our\\norganizations.\\nI began my statement today by denouncing fear and\\nwith a plea for a new international moral code. I would like\\nto conclude an observation that I made at the outset: that\\nwords are hollow if they are mere figures of speech and\\ndiplomatic formulas. Our words must be alive, and they\\nmust spring from peace, silence and complete transparency.\\nOnly then will we be able to understand the language of the\\nmany children, women and men afflicted by\\nunderdevelopment, war and indifference.\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffMy country is especially pleased at the\\nPresident’s election to lead the General Assembly. He\\nrepresents a great country that plays an important role in\\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and I\\nam glad that he is to preside over our work during this\\ncrucial period for our Organization.\\n17\\n\\n\\nI should also like to endorse the remarks made by\\nIreland’s Foreign Minister in the name of the European\\nUnion.\\nLast year, we celebrated the first half century of the\\nUnited Nations existence, during which its energies were\\ndevoted, with a success universally acknowledged, to the\\norganization of international society. A mammoth collective\\nundertaking has been accomplished and the United Nations\\nhas become the keystone of an international system founded\\non law and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. This\\ncollective undertaking owes much to the determined action\\nof successive Secretaries-General, and I should like to pay\\na special and warm tribute here to Mr. Boutros-Ghali,\\nwhose determination, vision of the future and firmness have\\ngiven our Organization a presence and vitality rarely\\nachieved. He deserves our confidence.\\nToday, as the century reaches its turning point, the\\nOrganization is confronted with another major challenge:\\nglobalization. In every sphere, the ideas and realities to\\nwhich we were accustomed are changing at a pace\\nunequalled in human history. The movement of people, of\\nideas and images, and of goods is accelerating as distances\\nshrink. At the same time, the standardization of cultural\\npractices — and the legitimate reactions this provokes —\\nthe general spread of low-cost high technologies and\\nintensified competition bring into question the positions that\\nhave been achieved and the functioning, if not the very\\nfoundation, of international society. At the same time, the\\nproduction of wealth is increasing tenfold and scientific\\nprogress is growing rapidly, while unexpected opportunities\\nfor development are being given to new nations.\\nBut these benefits have adverse effects. The control\\nfragile States have over their development is being eroded,\\nnational legislation is becoming inapplicable and the notion\\nof territorial integrity is changing in meaning. In short,\\nnational authorities are too often reduced to powerlessness\\nby transnational phenomena over which they have only\\nscant control. If we are not careful, we are going to be\\nliving in a world without criteria, without values, without\\nreferences, in which some — the strongest and the\\nrichest — will be in a position to decide alone on the future\\nof the planet. It should come as no surprise that, in these\\ncircumstances, the United Nations has many detractors.\\nOur Organization is in effect a privileged forum in\\nwhich the framework of a genuine international society can\\nbe built, a framework that frees the forces of creativity and\\ndevelopment and represses the forces of violence and\\noppression. It is up to all of us present here to enable the\\nUnited Nations to play that role and to ensure peace,\\nsecurity and progress in these new circumstances and in\\nkeeping with its mandate. Rest assured that France, a\\nfounding Member of the Organization and permanent\\nmember of the Security Council, will devote all its\\nenergies to this task and will be in the front ranks of this\\nnew fight.\\nOur world is confronted today with terrible problems\\nthat know no borders and, sadly, spare no population:\\nterrorism, crime and drugs. The fight against these\\nscourges is foremost in our concerns and high on the\\ninternational agenda. Accordingly, an uncompromising\\nfight against terrorism, whatever its forms, perpetrators\\nand motives, constitutes our priority. This is why I\\nconvened a conference on terrorism in Paris last July that\\nbrought together the G-7 countries and Russia. We\\nadopted 25 practical, specific recommendations. They will\\nbe implemented by each State and will strengthen\\ninternational cooperation against terrorism. Therefore,\\ntoday I make a solemn call on the entire international\\ncommunity to join wholeheartedly in this fight.\\nWe must also react without weakness to the\\nchallenge of organized crime, in the knowledge that it\\nknows how to make the fullest use of the possibilities that\\nhave been opened up by the liberalization of trade. For it\\nis the very foundation of our societies and institutions that\\nit endangers today.\\nInternational cooperation is indispensable to stem\\nthis phenomenon. France, pursuing the path mapped out\\nby the Canadian presidency, has drafted a corpus of legal\\nand operational recommendations with its G-7 partners\\nand Russia to improve the effectiveness of the fight\\nagainst this scourge. These should guide in particular the\\naction of the States most affected by transnational\\norganized crime. France recently strengthened its financial\\nlegislation against money-laundering. All States should\\npay particular attention to this phenomenon, which is one\\nof the hardest forms of organized crime to counter.\\nOne of the most loathsome aspects of organized\\ncrime is that which targets our children. A world summit\\non combating the sexual exploitation of children was\\nrecently held in Stockholm. That is good, but it is still not\\nenough. Everyone must now make a commitment to\\nimplementing effective measures for immediate\\napplication. I urge all States represented here to act\\nquickly and with determination in this area which, more\\nthan any other, affects our future. The Assembly may rest\\nassured of France’s political resolve.\\n18\\n\\n\\nDrugs are a formidable threat today because of the\\nravages they inflict on young people. International\\ncooperation must be solid. The producer and consumer\\ncountries must recognize their shared responsibility. The\\ninternational community must therefore continue to pursue\\nconvergent policies to reduce the supply of illegal\\nsubstances and the demand for them. The European Union\\nhas chosen such a global policy and has launched large-\\nscale actions in close coordination with international\\ninstitutions, in particular the United Nations International\\nDrug Control Programme. France strongly supports the\\nproposal to convene a special session of the General\\nAssembly devoted to drugs in 1998.\\nThese new perils do not supplant the traditional\\nchallenges, which our Organization must address with\\nsustained vigilance and unwavering firmness. Peace-keeping\\nremains the central function of our Organization under the\\nterms of the founding Charter. The mission of the United\\nNations to soothe tensions, separate combatants and resolve\\nconflicts remains fundamental.\\nThe panoply of available instruments is becoming\\nmore diversified. Recent additions to conventional peace-\\nkeeping missions include activities to consolidate peace,\\npreventive diplomacy measures and even regional\\nconferences — such as I hope will soon take place with\\nregard to the situation in the Great Lakes region.\\nSanctions constitute one of these instruments. They are\\na useful weapon, but they penalize populations and must\\ntherefore be used with prudence and moderation, follow\\nstrict criteria and — I stress this — always be limited in\\ntime. Only under those conditions can sanctions, which are\\nsometimes necessary to prevent something worse, continue\\nto be used by our Organization with the required\\nlegitimacy.\\nOf course, we cannot refer to the traditional challenges\\nto peace without speaking about current regional conflicts.\\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, where my country has paid a\\nheavy tribute, France is pleased that elections could be held,\\nimperfect though they were. That represents an essential\\nstage in the return to peace provided for by the agreements\\nsigned in Paris in 1995.\\nBut peace still has to be consolidated, devastated\\nterritories be reconstructed, refugees encouraged to return\\nand a civilian society rebuilt. To that end, France has\\nproposed a plan of consolidated action by the international\\ncommunity with a time-frame of two years. With this goal\\nin mind, we will very shortly be hosting an international\\nconference in Paris to examine, and I hope adopt, this\\nproposal.\\nSimilarly, the peace process in the Middle East\\nseems to be at a crucial stage. I wish here to express my\\nanxiety about it. I certainly believe the process to be\\nirreversible, but I am also aware of the precariousness of\\nthe gains and the urgency of the need for long-term\\nsolutions. We are half-way there. I say “we”, because this\\nprocess concerns not just Arabs and Israelis but all of us\\nhere.\\nFor France, peace in the Middle East is built upon\\ndialogue between equal partners, respect for the identity\\nof each and the right of peoples to the free determination\\nof their destiny, the affirmation of their independence, and\\nsecurity. That is why — and I wish to emphasize this\\npoint — France believes that there will be no lasting\\npeace in the region, based on an exchange of land for\\npeace, unless the right of the Palestinian people to self-\\ndetermination is respected, together with their legitimate\\naspirations for a State.\\nWe believe that a just and balanced agreement\\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians cannot avoid the issues\\nof Jerusalem, refugees and the settlements in the\\nPalestinian territories. Finally, a lasting peace presupposes\\nthat Israel is assured of its existence within secure and\\nrecognized borders.\\nFrance believes that complete withdrawal from the\\nGolan Heights in exchange for total peace constitutes the\\nbasis of an agreement between Syria and Israel, and that\\nLebanon must regain full and complete sovereignty over\\nthe whole of its territory.\\nBased on these principles, France intends to have a\\ngreater and more active presence than ever in the Middle\\nEast, with which it has close and long-standing relations.\\nIt will pursue this policy in close consultation with its\\nEuropean partners. Furthermore, Europe must have a\\nplace, alongside the two sponsors of the peace process,\\ncommensurate with the major contribution it is making to\\nthe region’s development.\\nWhile we are endeavouring to build peace in areas\\nin crisis, our efforts are no less ambitious for the entire\\nEuropean continent. In building step by step what we call\\nan “architecture of security“, we are really offering the\\ninternational community a pillar of peace. France is\\nmaking an important contribution to the establishment on\\n19\\n\\n\\nthe European continent a system of global security that\\nleaves no one out on the edge.\\nThe construction of peace in Europe began with the\\nconstruction of European institutions. It is being continued\\nby deepening the Union. The intergovernmental Conference\\nrepresents a decisive stage in this process, the forerunner of\\nexpansion, which is vital to the stability and prosperity of\\nthe continent.\\nFrance wishes to see the Union go still further by\\ngiving substance to the European identity in security and\\ndefence matters. To that end, we would like to see a\\nstrengthening of the Western European Union and its\\ngradual rapprochement with the European Union.\\nThe European identity is also based on the reform of\\nthe Atlantic Alliance. France, after taking a decisive step,\\nis now working actively with its allies on the adaptation of\\nstructures. This should allow the emergence of a genuine\\nEuropean security and defence identity within the Alliance\\nand make it possible in practice for the Western European\\nUnion, and therefore the European Union, to use the assets\\nof the Alliance for military action that Europeans decide to\\nundertake themselves. This reform is also the key to the\\nprocess of expanding the Alliance, with which France is\\nready to assist. That expansion must naturally go hand-in-\\nhand with in-depth dialogue and cooperation with Russia.\\nThe third and last aspect of the structure is the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\\n(OSCE), which is the sole forum for security in which all\\nthe European States are represented on an equal footing.\\nThat is why France believes that it is necessary to\\nstrengthen the organization. We hope that the Lisbon\\nsummit will provide the occasion to move towards the\\ndrafting of a charter or treaty linking all the States of the\\ncontinent.\\nImportant events therefore await us on the path that\\nwe have mapped out, including the OSCE summit in\\nDecember and the NATO summit next year. The latter\\nshould bring together all the European States for a\\n“pan-Europe day”, demonstrating the community of security\\ninterests of all the countries on the continent, including\\nRussia and our North American allies whose role in\\nEuropean security remains decisive. That is our ambition\\nfor a Europe of security that leaves no one out and is safer\\nand more stable for the entire international community.\\nIn this changing world, it is for the United Nations to\\nbring out the common values that will be the foundations\\nof civilization in the twenty-first century. It is thanks to\\nits actions that we hope to build a safer, less harsh world\\nfor its inhabitants. First, we hope it will be a world in\\nwhich the spectre of nuclear war has faded. For many\\nyears, public opinion called for a complete ban on nuclear\\ntests. It was a hope and a plan that was certainly worthy,\\nbut remained blocked by the reality of East-West\\nconfrontation.\\nFrance welcomes the signing of the Comprehensive\\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which I had the honour to sign\\nyesterday. This Treaty marks a major turning-point in the\\nworld’s strategic balances.\\nIt puts an end to the possibility of the nuclear-\\nweapon States’ developing new types of nuclear weapons,\\nand it makes a decisive contribution to the fight against\\nnuclear-weapon proliferation.\\nThe Treaty thus opens the way to a more stable,\\nsafer world which will cease to be haunted by the twin\\ndangers of the nuclear-arms race and the proliferation of\\nthese weapons.\\nThere is another development which I find\\nremarkable: the endorsement of human rights as a major\\nprinciple of international relations. And the United\\nNations is at the centre of this development.\\nI should like in this regard to pay tribute to the\\nremarkable work done by the Commission on Human\\nRights. In often difficult circumstances, it has pursued\\nwith pragmatism and tenacity its patient efforts to awaken\\nconsciences, to galvanize energies and to promote the rule\\nof law in concrete ways.\\nOur aim must not be to pronounce\\nexcommunications or establish a blacklist, generally to no\\neffect. Rather, it must be to promote the protection of\\nindividuals and the progress of law with due respect for\\ndifferences.\\nI should also like to reaffirm France’s determination\\nto see crimes against humanity punished. The\\ncondemnation they warrant cannot brook any exception.\\nTogether with others, France took the initiative of\\nproposing the establishment of the international criminal\\nTribunal and the international Tribunal for Rwanda. I\\nwish to reaffirm France’s unqualified support for their\\nfounding work, and its backing in order that the tribunals\\nmight carry out their work in full.\\n20\\n\\n\\nLastly, France is pleased that the foundations that have\\nthus been laid have helped to speed up the debates on the\\nestablishment of an international criminal court, which we\\nearnestly desire and to which we attach a high priority.\\nThere are other important areas which we have begun\\nto consider.\\nAt this time when workers, money, factories and\\ncommerce operate at a heightened pace, it is essential to\\ndevelop dialogue among the partners of economic life. This\\nis really the only solid basis on which to build social\\nprotection that preserves the interests of all without harming\\nthe growth of economies.\\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the International Labour\\nOrganisation (ILO) provided the opportunity to recall the\\nessential role of this organization in defining these minimal\\nnorms, without which the economic world is but a vast\\njungle.\\nUniversality, however, must not lead to uniformity.\\nThe definition of common values, accepted by all, is based\\non respect for the identities that underpin the cultures of the\\nworld. Our values will thus command all the more respect\\nfor being expressed in all our respective languages.\\nAccordingly, we welcome the fact that the General\\nAssembly last year adopted a resolution on multilingualism\\nby a very large majority. Our civilizations, languages and\\ncultures, inherited from an often turbulent history, but of\\nirreplaceable richness, are a precious legacy for humankind.\\nThe importance that my country ascribes to the\\nFrench-speaking community reflects its determination to\\nmaintain the specificity and richness of the profoundly\\noriginal world view of several hundreds of millions of\\npeople. We will not give this up.\\nThe search for a new world ethic is not limited to\\nhuman rights but extends to the whole of international life.\\nSince 1945, international trade has been a powerful growth\\nfactor, contributing to a large extent to the expansion of the\\nindustrialized economies and to the success of the so-called\\nemerging countries. But here too we must have rules of the\\ngame, acknowledged at the world level, so as to develop\\nand regulate trade, ensure that it is fair and prevent\\nunilateral conduct.\\nI should like to mention here the dangers of\\nunilateralism. Unilateralism: behind this technocratic word\\nlurks the temptation to impose the law of the strongest at\\nthe expense of dialogue and negotiation.\\nFrance and Europe cannot accept that one country,\\neven if it is the most powerful, attempt to regulate world\\ntrade by itself by means of decisions that have extra-\\nterritorial scope. The World Trade Organization does not\\nallow it, and no one should doubt the firmness of French\\nand European reactions were such measures actually to be\\nimplemented.\\nThe globalization of the economy and the\\nliberalization of trade and investments have opened up\\nunprecedented prospects. However, we must take care not\\nto allow the gap to widen between the nations that trade,\\ninvest and derive profit from this new factor and those\\nthat remain on the sidelines of this new prosperity.\\nEach nation is responsible for itself and must create,\\nthrough rigorous public management and compliance with\\nits legislative rulings, optimum conditions for freeing\\nprivate initiative, a factor in economic and commercial\\nprogress. But I do not believe that one can leave to\\nmarket forces alone the care of ensuring the development\\nof the poorest nations.\\nHere, too, the United Nations has an important role\\nto play. By its side, the wealthiest States must affirm their\\nsolidarity in a tangible way: actively and effectively, this\\nsolidarity must assist the developing countries without\\nbecoming a substitute for them. On the threshold of a\\nnew century, poverty and exclusion cannot constitute the\\nsole prospects for two-thirds of humankind. France, for its\\npart, will not accept this.\\nThis commitment concerns Africa in particular,\\nwhere real prospects for progress are beginning to\\nemerge.\\nAfrica has embarked with courage and perseverance\\non the path to readjustment and recovery, which will\\nenable it to find its place again in the great flows of\\nworld trade.\\nFor the first time in a long time, Africa’s growth\\nrate has been on the order of 5 per cent these past two\\nyears, higher than its demographic expansion, very high\\nthough it is. This is a reassuring sign, attributable to the\\nefforts made by the African States themselves. They have\\nbeen able to cut public deficits, establish realistic\\nmonetary parities, open up their markets and move\\ntowards regional integration and democratization. Such\\n21\\n\\n\\nachievements, which are the result of structural reforms,\\nseem to us to justify our confidence. France believes in\\nAfrica’s future.\\nStill, official development assistance must be\\nmaintained and strengthened, but this assistance must be the\\nsubject of many initiatives. France has taken such\\ninitiatives within the European Union, the African\\nDevelopment Bank, the International Development\\nAssociation and the International Monetary Fund.\\nRecently, at the summit of industrialized countries\\nheld in Lyons, my country reaffirmed the need to increase\\naid to the poorest countries, asking for more generous\\ntreatment of debt for them, and for a new global partnership\\nto be defined between the developing countries and the\\nmultilateral institutions.\\nIn this new world context, we have to consider the\\nprogress that the United Nations needs to make to be able\\nto meet its responsibilities for the next century.\\nFrance approves of the current discussions on\\nimproving the representative character of the Security\\nCouncil, in particular with respect to Germany, Japan and\\nthe States of the South.\\nSimilarly, under the decisive impetus of the Secretary-\\nGeneral, the Organization has embarked on a vast effort for\\nstructural reform, the first results of which are beginning to\\nshow.\\nIt is not a matter of changing everything but of seeing\\nthat every institution is in a position to make a useful\\ncontribution to the collective work in its own sphere.\\nThat is why the members of the G-7 have proposed\\nputting the savings realized through reforms into\\ndevelopment projects.\\nFrance would like to see the reform of the United\\nNations economic and social sector concluded quickly so as\\nto strengthen the overall coherence of the Organization. To\\nthat end, the roles and mandates of the specialized agencies\\nand commissions in particular should be better defined, and\\nwaste and duplication eliminated.\\nThese proposals are dictated solely by the wish to help\\nthe United Nations better fulfil its mission of fighting\\npoverty and exclusion on a global scale.\\nIn the case of the United Nations budget, many of us\\nare worried about the financial crisis that threatens to\\nparalyse the United Nations. The European Union has put\\nforward concrete proposals for overcoming this crisis. It\\nis now up to all States that have let their arrears\\naccumulate to assume their responsibilities.\\nWhatever some may say, the United Nations is still\\none of our best chances for building a better world. Let\\nus not spoil it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffAllow me first\\nof all to congratulate the President most warmly on his\\nelection to serve as President of the fifty-first session of the\\nGeneral Assembly.\\nI also wish to convey my thanks to the previous\\nPresident, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for the commitment, skill\\nand poise with which he led our work at the last session of\\nthe Assembly.\\nI would also like to convey my appreciation to our\\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\\nongoing outstanding work for our Organization since\\nbeginning of his term.\\nThe views of the Luxembourg Government on the\\nmajor international issues are the same as those expressed\\nby our European Union partners. They were presented to\\nthe Assembly yesterday morning by Mr. Dick Spring,\\nPresident of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs\\nof Ireland.\\nLuxembourg learned with great satisfaction that our\\nGeneral Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, had\\nadopted and opened for signature the resolution\\ncontaining the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\\nYesterday, on behalf of the Luxembourg Government, I\\nsigned that document, which marks substantial progress\\ntowards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\\ncreation of a safer and more humane world. I hope that\\nthe parties concerned will continue to work to create the\\nright conditions for the rapid entry into force of this\\nTreaty.\\nAlso in the area of disarmament, I support without\\nreserve the United Nations work on the question of anti-\\npersonnel landmines, which day after day, long after the\\nguns have fallen silent in a conflict, continue to claim\\ncountless victims. If there is any evil which must be\\neradicated, this is it.\\nI rejoice in the significant progress which has been\\nachieved, in less than a year, in the conflict in the former\\nYugoslavia. I welcome the holding of elections on 14\\nSeptember, which marks a decisive stage for the future of\\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnians, Serbs and Croats must\\nnow organize their cooperation by first setting up\\ncommon institutions.\\nI regard these elections as a first, important step in\\nthe framework of a process of democratization and\\nstabilization that must be carried further. Its success will\\ndepend above all on the Bosnian parties. It will also\\ndepend on neighbouring countries, in particular Croatia\\nand the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Lastly, it will\\ndepend on the support of the international community. My\\nGovernment is in favour of continued international\\ncivilian and military action in order to create the\\nenvironment required to preserve peace and prevent a\\nreturn to war.\\nLuxembourg is concerned by the check to the peace\\nprocess in the Middle East that has followed the change\\nof Government in Israel. We take the view that there is\\n13\\n\\n\\nno alternative to this complex and fragile process: the fruit\\nof arduous negotiations. We urge our friends in Israel to\\npursue this process, to comply with and execute the\\ncommitments undertaken pursuant to the Oslo agreements\\nand to avoid creating fresh obstacles. We fear that any\\nother policy may generate further tension and once again\\ntrigger a spiral of violence that would inflict suffering on\\nall the peoples of the region. The alarming events that took\\nplace on the West Bank today threaten to destroy the results\\nof several years of effort to achieve a just and lasting peace\\nin the Middle East.\\nThe Luxembourg Government condemns the recent\\nattacks launched by the Government of Saddam Hussein on\\nthe Kurdish population of northern Iraq. It was inevitable\\nthat measures would be taken to react to this fresh\\noffensive. We call for a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces\\nand for full respect for the territorial integrity of Iraq. We\\nhope that the implementation of the “oil-for-food”\\nresolution may take place without delay in order to relieve\\nthe hardships suffered by the civilian population of that\\ncountry.\\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa, in\\nparticular in Burundi, continues to give us the greatest\\ncause for concern. I fully support the efforts of the United\\nNations, in close cooperation with the Organization of\\nAfrican Unity, to avert both the occurrence in Burundi of\\na tragedy such as occurred in Rwanda and a deterioration\\nof the situation which could plunge the region into war.\\nOver the last year, the United Nations has substantially\\ncut the number of its peace-keeping operations. This\\nreduction in our activities and the set-backs that we have\\nwitnessed in the past should not, however, diminish our\\nefforts to enhance the United Nations capacity to avert,\\nprevent the spread of and halt conflicts, and to save human\\nlives.\\nIt is utterly unfair to criticize the United Nations\\nwhenever a peace-keeping operation runs into difficulties.\\nMany of the shortcomings attributed to the United Nations\\ncould be resolved if all Member States undertook to pay\\ntheir contributions to our Organization and, especially,\\nmake available to it the resources that it needs. For this\\nreason, Luxembourg supports the ongoing work and\\nreflection aimed at equipping the Organization with a rapid-\\nintervention force that would enable it to react to crises in\\na timely fashion. Where non-military means have failed, it\\nshould be possible to deploy well-trained and properly\\nequipped peace-keeping contingents in the field very\\npromptly in order to give practical effect to the Security\\nCouncil’s decisions.\\nGreater responsibility should henceforth be given to\\nregional organizations. The Organization for Security and\\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is nowadays playing a\\nleading role in conflict management in Europe and the\\nCaucasus. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\n(NATO) in the former Yugoslavia and the Organization\\nof African Unity (OAU) in the Great Lakes region are\\ndoing the same. Other regional and subregional\\norganizations in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere are\\nperforming similar tasks with the support of the United\\nNations.\\nInternational security begins with the security of the\\nindividual, with respect for his fundamental rights and his\\nprotection against any violation of those rights, including\\nthe actions of his own Government. Nothing, therefore,\\ncan justify violations of human rights, which by their very\\nnature have universal value. Our Organization plays an\\nimportant role in developing international machinery\\ndesigned to provide effective protection for human rights.\\nThis role takes the form, among others, of the efforts to\\ncarry out systematic investigations and enquiries with a\\nview to sanctioning those responsible for violations of\\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights.\\nLuxembourg supports the early creation of an\\ninternational criminal court, which would be a decisive\\nstep forward in ensuring respect for the principles of\\ninternational law.\\nAmong the most vulnerable human beings are our\\nchildren, and they therefore deserve special protection.\\nThe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the\\nChild marks a major advance. Scrupulously applied, that\\nConvention will be an invaluable instrument in\\nsafeguarding children against physical and psychological\\nviolence. In 1995 my Government proposed to the United\\nNations a similar, indeed, a complementary initiative, to\\neliminate the exploitation of child labour. I welcome this\\nAssembly adoption of that proposal designed to come to\\nthe aid of the tens of millions of children forced to work\\nfrom an early age. This effort should be strengthened and\\nfurther pursued. Luxembourg also hails the results of the\\nStockholm World Congress on the Commercial Sexual\\nExploitation of Children. My Government is resolved to\\nfoster international cooperation in the prevention and\\nsuppression of sexual exploitation of children in order to\\neffectively protect and safeguard children at the\\ninternational level against such criminal practices.\\n14\\n\\n\\nThe globalization of the world economy is bringing\\nabout profound changes in international relations. A\\nveritable revolution in information and communication\\ntechnologies reducing geographic distances to nothing has\\nled to a speeding up of business transactions and financial\\nflows, as well as increased integration of markets.\\nGenerally accepted ideas have been turned upside down,\\nand serious questions have been raised even among\\nindustrialized countries, where unemployment has grown to\\nalarming proportions.\\nAt the same time, we note that a significant number of\\ndeveloping countries remain on the sidelines of\\ndevelopment and remain in great poverty. At a time when\\nour Organization proclaimed 1996 International Year for the\\nEradication of Poverty, more than 1.5 billion human beings\\ncontinue to live in a state of absolute poverty. We cannot\\nremain indifferent to this situation. What should particularly\\ndisturb us is the inequality gap, which is widening both\\nwithin countries and between the countries of the North and\\nthe South. This is a dangerous source of new tensions and\\nconflicts.\\nThe United Nations Development Programme’s latest\\nreport on human development speaks of worldwide social\\nfragmentation. It underscores the widening disparities\\nbetween rich and poor States and increased imbalances in\\nsocieties between inhabitants of the same country. The\\npopulation explosion and uneven access to the fruits of\\ntechnological progress further compound these distortions.\\nThis trend is likely to trigger increasingly massive\\nmigrations within countries and from poor countries to\\nricher ones.\\nIn order to remedy this situation, I propose to develop\\na new strategy based on four main courses of action. First,\\nwe should provide follow-up to, and translate into\\noperational activities, the results of the major conferences\\nheld since the beginning of this decade in Rio, Vienna,\\nCairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and, most recently, in Istanbul.\\nThe World Food Summit scheduled by the Food and\\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for\\nNovember and the special session on sustainable\\ndevelopment in the spring of 1997 are also opportunities to\\ndefine an integrated programme of action to foster human\\ndevelopment.\\nSecondly, we must halt the persistent decline of funds\\nmade available for development, a symptom of “donor\\nfatigue”. In each of our countries we must launch a new\\nmovement of solidarity to benefit the poorest and least\\ndeveloped countries. The Government of Luxembourg has\\ndecided to increase year by year its contribution to\\ncooperation for development. Our intention is to achieve\\nthe target of devoting 0.7 per cent of our gross national\\nproduct to official development assistance before the end\\nof this decade. A significant portion of these funds will\\nbe made available to the various funds and programmes\\nof the United Nations system. This is not simply a\\nquestion of solidarity and social justice on a world scale;\\nit is, above all, a preventive policy designed to contribute,\\nhowever modestly, to peace by encouraging development.\\nThe third main course of action is to strengthen the\\nUnited Nations capacity to act in the economic and social\\nfield. That strengthening requires courageous reforms of\\nits structures. Above and beyond the proposals of the\\nSummit of major industrialized countries at Lyon, which\\nI welcome, I advocate a single rigorous coordination\\nstructure for all economic and social activities and,\\nespecially, a concerted restructuring of the bodies and\\nmandates concerned. In this context, I note with interest,\\nthe proposal of the XX Congress of the Socialist\\nInternational, which took place recently in this very\\nbuilding, calling for the setting up of integrated economic\\ninstitutions on the regional and international levels and for\\nthe setting up of a United Nations economic security\\ncouncil.\\nFourthly, we must develop cooperation with the\\nrepresentatives of organized civil society, which is to say,\\nthe non-governmental organizations.The participation of\\nnon-governmental organizations in international\\norganizations reinforces, in a sense, the political\\nlegitimacy of those international bodies. The\\nrepresentatives of civil society nowadays play a key role\\nin the activities of the United Nations system, whether in\\nthe promotion of human rights and democracy, in\\nhumanitarian assistance or in cooperation for\\ndevelopment. They make an invaluable contribution not\\nonly to the Organization’s operational activities but also\\nto its thinking processes, as attested to by the significant\\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations in the\\npreparation, holding and follow-up of the major world\\nconferences organized by the United Nations.\\nThis new dimension of our work was also\\nhighlighted at the congress of the World Federation of\\nUnited Nations Associations, whose fiftieth-anniversary\\nmeeting, I am proud to note, was held in Luxembourg a\\nlittle over a month ago.\\nThe financial situation of our Organization continues\\nto be a matter of grave concern. As of July, the United\\n15\\n\\n\\nNations cash flow was exhausted, and this situation can\\nonly worsen between now and the end of the year.\\nAny attempt at a radical reform of the system will be\\nfutile if we continue to neglect the fundamental need to put\\nit on an adequate and reliable financial footing. The United\\nNations cannot discharge its important responsibilities\\neffectively if it is reduced to constant worry about making\\nends meet.\\nAdmittedly, the Organization could do even more to\\ncontrol its expenditure and enhance its effectiveness.\\nGreater attention should be given, inter alia, to the question\\nof establishing each State’s assessed contribution, which\\nshould be based on objective criteria and reflect each\\ncountry’s real ability to pay. However, the crisis will be\\novercome only if each Member State fulfils its obligations\\nby making full, timely and unconditional payment of its\\nfinancial contribution. I therefore unreservedly support the\\nproposals made by the European Union in this regard.\\nIn the ongoing reform process, one aspect is of\\nparticular significance. Within our Organization, the\\nSecurity Council bears unique responsibilities as the organ\\nentrusted with preventing and resolving conflicts.One of the\\ngreatest lessons to be learnt from the experiences and\\nsetbacks of recent years is that Security Council members\\nmust, if they wish to preserve its credibility, demonstrate\\ntheir determination to enforce their decisions, once taken.\\nThe credibility and effectiveness of the Council with\\nregard to peace-keeping and international security will be\\nreinforced by the establishment of more open, transparent\\nand collegial decision-making processes while maintaining\\nclose consultation with the countries supplying matériel and\\ncontingents. The not-insignificant progress made in this\\nrespect in the recent past should be integrated into the\\nsystem.\\nIn addition, the Council’s legitimacy, and probably the\\nquality of its decisions, would also benefit from a\\nreadjustment in membership. The enlargement of the\\nCouncil should take into account the ability of member\\nStates to contribute to peace-keeping and to the\\nachievement of the Organization’s goals. A better balance\\nmust be struck between industrialized and developing\\ncountries.\\nThe passing of the bipolar world has freed our planet\\nfrom the ideological, political and military fetters that\\nimpeded to an extraordinary degree our capacity to act.\\nRelieved of the threat of global confrontation and nuclear\\nholocaust, we are now faced with a series of worldwide\\nproblems, old and new, that includes underdevelopment,\\nenvironmental degradation, the proliferation of all kinds\\nof weapons, terrorism, ethnic conflicts, drug trafficking,\\nviolence and crime in all its guises.\\nLuxembourg is convinced that the solution to those\\nproblems lies not in isolationism, nor in nationalism, nor\\nin fundamentalism of any description. We would also be\\ndeluding ourselves were we to put our trust solely in the\\nmarket and private initiative to remedy all humanity’s ills.\\nOnly through an approach based on cooperation,\\nsolidarity, tolerance and mutual esteem can we tackle\\nthose problems successfully at both the regional and the\\nworld levels.\\nThis has been the approach of the European Union\\nand its member States, which have succeeded in attaining,\\nin Europe, a level of stability and prosperity hitherto\\nunknown. The approach is based on the concept of\\ndemocracy and of a market economy that is not\\nuncontrolled but socially responsible, one in which the\\nState fully shoulders its responsibilities in the areas of\\nhealth, education and social justice. The system requires\\nconstant adjustments, but its principles and bases are not\\nsubject to debate. Other parts of the world have also\\nsuccessfully entered into a process of cooperation and\\nregional integration.\\nOn the world level, the United Nations is the only\\ntruly universal Organization. We must work at this level\\nto make a contribution vital to the solution of global\\nproblems, one that will complement the efforts being\\nmade at the regional level.\\nThat is the new and important responsibility that\\nbecame evident in the course of the events and meetings\\nthat occurred the world over in commemorating the\\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year. There\\nwas emphasis on the need to set up new structures and to\\nreform the United Nations, to give it the requisite capacity\\nfor review, action and cooperation.\\nIt is our hope that, with a heightened awareness of\\nthe interests of all mankind we, the representatives of the\\nStates Members of the United Nations, will succeed in\\ndisplaying the vision, courage and political resolve needed\\nto make our Organization an effective instrument capable\\nof facing the challenges of the third millennium.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\ufeffWe are glad to see the\\nGeneral Assembly, the key organ in the reform process of\\nthe Organization, meet under a President who combines\\nprofound knowledge of the United Nations with a\\nreputation for strong leadership.\\nMy colleague from Ireland has already outlined the\\npositions of the European Union, which we fully endorse.\\nI will elaborate on a few points to which Austria attaches\\nparticular importance.\\nWhen discussing the need for reform a year ago,\\nHeads of State and Government expressed their political\\nwill to give the twenty-first century a United Nations\\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively the\\npeoples in whose name it was established. However,\\ninsufficient progress has been made so far in implementing\\nthis commitment. While the Secretary-General, to whose\\nspirited leadership of the Organization I should like to pay\\na warm personal tribute, has undertaken a number of\\nimportant reform initiatives, the Working Groups of the\\nGeneral Assembly have made only limited progress. Much\\nmore needs to be done. And we must always bear in mind\\nthat reform is not mere downsizing, but pursuing our goals\\neffectively and efficiently. Four principles should, in our\\nview, guide our reform agenda. As the first priority and as\\na precondition for reform, we must fulfil our financial\\nobligations in accordance with the United Nations Charter;\\nwe must give clear mandates and provide the necessary\\nresources; we must ensure the competitiveness of the\\nUnited Nations system; and we must eliminate duplication,\\nwaste and mismanagement.\\nWe should like to see strong United Nations leadership\\nin the following areas.\\nAs regards human rights, the results of the World\\nConference on Human Rights form an integral part of the\\ncoordinated follow-up to recent United Nations conferences.\\nAustria will play an active role in preparations for the\\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\\nHuman Rights and the five-year review of the Vienna\\nDeclaration and Programme of Action in 1998. Today,\\nour main task is not to elaborate new international\\nstandards in the field of human rights but to ensure full\\nrespect for the broad body of existing norms and rules in\\nall parts of the world. This requires the active\\ninvolvement of the entire United Nations system. This\\nincludes United Nations Development Programme\\n(UNDP) projects on governance; the United Nations\\nChildren’s Fund’s efforts in the field of juvenile justice;\\nprogrammes of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\\nBranch of the Secretariat for the strengthening of criminal\\njustice systems; and the integration of human rights\\nelements into United Nations field missions. In the run-up\\nto 1998, system-wide cooperation and integration in the\\nfield of human rights have to be improved.\\nAustria pays particular attention to the promotion\\nand protection of minorities as a means both to prevent\\nand to resolve conflicts. Respecting the rights of\\nminorities is crucial for peaceful development and good\\nneighbourly relations. The case of South Tyrol is an\\nexcellent example. Half a century after the conclusion of\\nthe 1946 Treaty of Paris between Austria and Italy — of\\nfundamental importance for the survival of the Austrian\\nminority — the South Tyroleans enjoy the protection of\\na carefully regulated autonomy, which increasingly serves\\nas an inspiration in comparable situations elsewhere.\\nTurning next to drug control and organized crime, it\\nis estimated that drug sales generate more than\\n$120 billion annually, thus exceeding the gross domestic\\nproduct of many United Nations Member States. This\\neconomic power of drug traffickers is a serious threat to\\nthe stability and the democratic and legal institutions of\\nmany countries. Drug abuse also has severe social\\nconsequences for societies and individuals. Therefore,\\ndrug control must remain a top priority for the United\\nNations. Austria will welcome the holding of a special\\nsession of the General Assembly in 1998 devoted to this\\nquestion. In order to make that session a success, we\\nshould soon start our preparations at the national, regional\\nand international levels.\\nTrafficking in illicit drugs goes hand in hand with\\ntransnational organized crime and money laundering,\\nwhich can be fought only through intensified international\\ncooperation. In this regard, we encourage closer\\ncooperation between the United Nations International\\n8\\n\\n\\nDrug Control Programme and the Secretariat’s crime\\nDivision.\\nI turn now to fight against the sexual exploitation of\\nchildren. A phenomenon closely linked to organized crime\\nis the sexual exploitation of children; this contemporary\\nform of slavery can result in serious, life-long, even life-\\nthreatening consequences for the physical, psychological\\nand social development of children. The rights of children\\nand women being at the very heart of our concern, we\\nwould like in this respect to reiterate the importance we\\nattach to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as\\nwell as to the recommendations of the recent Stockholm\\nWorld Congress on Commercial Sexual Exploitation of\\nChildren. We are convinced that only a global partnership\\nuniting Governments, non-governmental organizations and\\nrelevant United Nations agencies can bring an end to the\\ntrafficking and exploitation of children and women for\\nsexual purposes.\\nPeace-keeping remains the international community's\\nmajor tool to assist parties to a conflict in the\\nimplementation of peace agreements or to provide a rapid\\nresponse to complex emergencies. In view of lessons\\nlearned from previous missions, we actively support the\\nimprovement of the rapid deployment capability of the\\nOrganization, including the establishment of a rapidly\\ndeployable headquarters.\\nCurrently, some 1,200 Austrians — troop contingents,\\nmilitary observers, civilian police and civilians — are\\nserving in United Nations missions and in the\\nImplementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nWe will continue to participate in such operations. In this\\ncontext, I am pleased to announce that my country will\\nparticipate in the system of stand-by arrangements. We will\\nalso continue to assist the United Nations in its efforts to\\nimprove the quality of peace-keeping personnel through our\\nparticipation in the United Nations training assistance team\\nprogramme. International training centres in Austria offer\\ntraining programmes for military as well as civilian\\npersonnel. We have joined forces with the Organization of\\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in the strengthening of conflict\\nprevention and peace-keeping capacities in Africa.\\nAs regards preventive diplomacy, over the last few\\nyears, we have witnessed an increase in the deployment of\\nsmall political field missions. They play an important role\\nin the preventive diplomacy efforts of the Secretary-General\\nand his Special Representatives, and in the coordination of\\npeace-building initiatives. Austria encourages the Secretary-\\nGeneral to make more use of this cost-effective instrument.\\nWe therefore support his proposal to establish clear\\nbudgetary procedures ensuring a sound and predictable\\nfinancial basis for such missions.\\nThe United Nations took the lead in developing the\\nconcept of post-conflict peace-building. Today, not only\\nthe United Nations but also the International Monetary\\nFund (IMF) and the World Bank, the Organization for\\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\\n(OSCE) are elaborating concepts of how to assist in the\\nconsolidation of peace and the prevention of the\\nrecurrence of conflicts. The objective of peace-building is\\npolitical, but it often requires action in the economic,\\nsocial, humanitarian or human rights fields.\\nThe broad variety of available instruments is amply\\ndemonstrated by a recent survey of the United Nations\\nsystem’s capabilities in post-conflict reconstruction\\ncompiled by the Vienna-based Reconstruction and\\nDevelopment Support Unit of the Secretariat.\\nThe ability of the United Nations system to act in an\\nintegrated manner in peace-building represents a test for\\nits overall ability to reform and to modernize. We call\\nupon the Secretary-General to develop comprehensive\\ncriteria and operational guidelines, including on the\\nquestion of leadership for peace-building activities. We\\nalso encourage the Secretary-General to intensify his\\ncooperation with international financial institutions and\\nother relevant actors in this field.\\nAs regards regional conflicts, time constraints\\nprevent me from addressing in detail the many situations\\nin all parts of the world where the international\\ncommunity, often under the leadership of the United\\nNations, has attempted to bring conflicts and human\\nsuffering to an end — as in the Great Lakes region of\\nAfrica, Liberia and Afghanistan. I will limit myself to a\\nconflict in our immediate neighbourhood, namely the\\nsituation in the Balkans: in the former Yugoslavia.\\nMy country follows developments there with both\\ngreat hope and great concern. The implementation of the\\nDayton Peace Agreement lags behind our expectations,\\nespecially in the civilian field. However, we must not\\noverlook the foremost achievement of this Agreement: the\\nfact that a very brutal and bloody war was stopped and\\nthat the road for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s return to\\nnormalcy was paved. It is an encouraging sign that\\nballots, and no longer bullets, are in place.\\n9\\n\\n\\nThe elections held on 14 September represent a vital\\nstep forward and indicate the Bosnian people’s\\ndetermination to continue with the peace process. The\\nsetting up of common institutions, as foreseen by the\\nDayton Agreement, is now the number-one task.\\nNotwithstanding the primary responsibility of the parties\\nthemselves to fully implement the Dayton peace accords, it\\nis indispensable that the international community not\\nabandon the country after the expiration of the IFOR\\nmandate by the end of this year. We will have to continue\\nto assist the people and authorities of Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina in their efforts to rebuild a civil society and to\\nstrengthen reconciliation among ethnic groups.\\nSustainable management of environmental resources to\\nensure both human progress and human survival poses a\\nmajor challenge at the outset of the twenty-first century. At\\npresent, we are compromising the ability of future\\ngenerations to meet their own needs. The United Nations\\nhas a crucial role to play in achieving a common\\nunderstanding of sustainability and in promoting its\\nimplementation. We therefore attach great importance to\\nnext year’s special session of the General Assembly on the\\noverall review and appraisal of Agenda 21. The special\\nsession should not only assess the implementation of the\\nRio commitments, but should also elaborate a global\\nconsensus on new important areas such as sustainable\\nconsumption, production patterns, energy and transport.\\nThe process of globalization also profoundly changes\\nthe parameters of social development in all countries. The\\nWorld Summit for Social Development took up this\\nchallenge and agreed on a set of principles, goals and\\ncommitments to enhance the benefits and mitigate the\\nnegative effects of this process. We welcome the\\ndetermination of the United Nations system to translate the\\noutcome of the Copenhagen Summit into its operational\\nwork for the benefit of all people.\\nWe are striving nationally to meet our commitments\\neven in times of budgetary cuts. I avail myself of this\\nopportunity to recall the Austrian invitation to hold a\\nregional follow-up conference to the social Summit in\\nVienna at the end of 1997 or the beginning of 1998.\\nMy next point is disarmament. A more cooperative\\napproach to security is to provide a setting conducive to\\ngiving new impetus to international disarmament and arms\\ncontrol. Serious efforts must be undertaken to eliminate\\nweapons of mass destruction and to strengthen the various\\narms control and non-proliferation regimes. At the same\\ntime, more attention should be devoted to areas of\\nconventional disarmament, such as the United Nations\\nRegister of Conventional Arms, small arms and arms\\ntransfers, as well as to the further development of\\nuniversal regimes of transparency in armaments. The\\nWassenaar Arrangement, recently established in Vienna,\\nwill make an important contribution to international peace\\nand security.\\nIn response to the human tragedy of civilian\\nlandmine victims, Austria has been one of the first\\ncountries to establish a total moratorium on anti-personnel\\nlandmines, and is aiming for an agreement on a\\nworldwide total ban on this scourge of humanity.\\nThe approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\\nBan Treaty (CTBT) constitutes a milestone on our path\\ntowards a more secure future, leaving behind the nuclear\\nweapons competition that defined the cold war. Austria\\nwelcomes the test moratoriums announced by all five\\ndeclared nuclear-weapon States, and we call on all States\\nto work on the rapid ratification of the CTBT in order to\\nfoster nuclear non-proliferation and to spare this planet\\nfurther ecological damage.\\nThe organization for the CTBT and, pending entry\\ninto force, its preparatory commission, will play a vital\\nrole in verifying the implementation of the test ban.\\nAustria considers it an honour to host such an important\\ninternational organization and will contribute its share to\\ncreating favourable working conditions. The position of\\nVienna, which already hosts the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), as the centre of global nuclear\\nnon-proliferation is further strengthened by the addition of\\ncrucial nuclear verification facilities.\\nThis fight can be won only by pursuing a double-\\ntracked approach: on one track, non-proliferation is a\\nprecondition for ridding ourselves of the risk of nuclear\\ndestruction. On the other track, the nuclear-weapon States\\nare called upon to honour their obligation under the\\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\\n(NPT) to disarm their nuclear arsenals with the ultimate\\ngoal of the complete elimination of these weapons.\\nThe United Nations should continue to play a\\nleading role in the progressive development of\\ninternational law. Austria highly esteems the work of the\\nInternational Law Commission. Currently the elaboration\\nof a statute for an international criminal court is of utmost\\nimportance. Austria strongly supports the early\\nestablishment of the court, to end the widespread culture\\nof impunity.\\n10\\n\\n\\nFinally, I would like to mention the United Nations\\nOffice at Vienna: our strong commitment to the United\\nNations also manifests itself in Austria’s role as one of the\\nheadquarters of the Organization. United Nations\\nprogrammes and agencies based in Vienna represent highly\\nimportant instruments in international efforts to meet new\\nthreats to peace, security and development. I am referring\\nto the key role of the International Atomic Energy Agency\\nin preventing nuclear proliferation; that of the United\\nNations International Drug Control Programme and the\\nUnited Nations crime Division, which fight against drug\\nabuse, money laundering, organized crime and corruption;\\nof the Office for Outer Space Affairs, the principal United\\nNations body for international cooperation in the peaceful\\nuses of outer space; of the United Nations Industrial\\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the central\\ncoordinating agency for information, analysis, advice and\\nassistance in the field of sustainable industrial development;\\nand of the United Nations Commission on International\\nTrade Law (UNCITRAL), the international centre for the\\npromotion, harmonization and unification of the law of\\ninternational trade. We would like to pay tribute to\\nUNCITRAL for the able manner in which it is carrying out\\nits task. The Austrian Government is looking forward to\\ncelebrating the Commission’s thirtieth anniversary on the\\noccasion of its next meeting, in spring 1997 in Vienna.\\nOver the years, the IAEA and the United Nations\\nOffice at Vienna have understood the importance of\\nbuilding a solid reputation for good and lean management.\\nUNIDO has undergone drastic reforms, streamlining its\\nsecretariat and clearly defining its priorities and areas of\\nconcern. As one of the host countries of the United\\nNations, we are particularly committed to the reform efforts\\nbeing undertaken by these organizations and by the United\\nNations system as a whole. We shall support all efforts to\\nfulfil the commitments we all agreed on last year, to make\\nthe United Nations fit for the twenty-first century.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\ufeffLast year we\\ntook stock of half a century of United Nations history. The\\nrock we are pushing up the hill like Sisyphus always seems\\nto roll back a little. We must not be discouraged by this. It\\nremains our responsibility to do what we solemnly\\nreaffirmed on the fiftieth anniversary of the world\\nOrganization: maintain peace and to help people who are\\nsuffering from want and poverty.\\nYou, Mr. President, have issued a warning to us all for\\nthis fifty-first General Assembly. We must look beyond our\\nnational borders, and think and act accordingly. After\\nmaking those anniversary promises, let us not fall back into\\nthe old routine and rituals. The vision of a more peaceful\\nand more equitable world must not be lost.\\nThe world Organization must continue to be the\\nworld’s conscience. For who else other than this forum is\\nto keep watch to prevent murder and torture, to ensure that\\nrefugees have the basic necessities of life and that our\\nchildren are protected and cared for?\\nThe world is grossly unjust. From the moment of birth\\nmillions of people have hardly any chance of living in\\nconditions worthy of humankind. No one can turn away\\nfrom this; it concerns us all. No country, no region and\\nno group of States can bear all of the world’s burdens and\\ntroubles alone. All, even the strongest among us, need\\nsolidarity, need the help of others. How can terrorism, for\\ninstance, a cancer of our time, be stopped without\\ninternational cooperation?\\nDevelopments over the past 10 years have shown\\nthere is no cause for resignation. There can be\\nprogress — provided we pool our resources and act\\ntogether. That is the lesson of Bosnia, of South Africa\\nand of the Middle East, and of the historic achievements\\nin the field of disarmament in recent years. Every child\\nthat is saved from death in Rwanda or Burundi, every\\nrefugee able to return to his native village in Bosnia,\\nevery rainforest area we can preserve, must strengthen our\\nhope. The one world requires us to act as one.\\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, a free election has been\\nheld for the first time after four terrible years of war. It\\nhas provided a crucial foundation for the country’s\\nrecovery. Joint institutions must now be created without\\ndelay. The future members of the three-person presidency\\nshould meet in Sarajevo before the end of September.\\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\\nEurope (OSCE) had a very difficult task supervising the\\nelection in Bosnia. That organization’s scope for action\\nmust be increased at the Lisbon Summit in December this\\nyear. The OSCE remains an indispensable pillar of the\\nnew peaceful order for Europe, which we believe to be\\nnecessary now that the iron curtain has come down.\\nThe forces working for peace in the region are\\nthemselves not strong enough; there is still no self-\\nsustaining stability. In Bosnia and Herzegovina there can\\nbe no permanent international police force — even the\\n60,000 troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\n(NATO), of the United Nations and of all the other\\ncountries cannot guarantee peace on the ground — but I\\nthink that for a limited time that country continues to\\nrequire a “fire brigade”. This presupposes a fresh mandate\\nfrom the Security Council.\\nGermany is willing to provide a military\\ncontribution. By admitting more than 320,000 war\\nrefugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany has\\npractised human solidarity. We also have more than\\n130,000 Yugoslav nationals, most of them from Kosovo,\\nwho have to return to their native regions. This is a heavy\\nburden for us, including in financial terms. But we gave\\n7\\n\\n\\ntemporary protection and shelter to these people on\\nhumanitarian grounds, and we will not be found wanting in\\nthis respect now that their repatriation is becoming possible.\\nEurope has been torn by fratricidal wars for centuries.\\nThe current peaceful unification of that continent is a\\nmessage of hope for the whole world. The first of our\\ncentral and eastern European neighbours will soon belong\\nto the Euro-Atlantic institutions.\\nMy country Germany owes its unity to the confidence\\nwhich the world placed in our policy of reconciliation and\\ngood neighbourliness. In our eyes that implies a duty:\\ntogether with France, we will remain the motor of European\\nUnion.\\nAddressing the Assembly in 1989, my predecessor\\nHans-Dietrich Genscher extended a hand to Poland. Today\\nI turn to our Czech neighbours in particular and say that the\\nGerman-Czech declaration will be adopted shortly. Czechs\\nand Germans can look confidently to a common European\\nfuture.\\nThe Russian people too must be winners in the process\\nof European unification. The special partnership which\\nNATO is seeking with Russia is of central importance for\\npeace and security in Europe. And that is why we want as\\nquickly as possible to draft the fundamentals of a charter\\nbetween NATO and Russia, as I suggested in Carcassonne\\n18 months ago at a meeting of the European Union foreign\\nministers. Our offer stands. Russia should help shape\\nEurope’s future as an equal partner. That large and\\nimportant country must be given a place in Europe\\ncommensurate with its size and importance.\\nPart of the European Union’s peace message is that\\nwe Europeans stand for a policy of international\\ncooperation among equals, and for a global partnership for\\ndevelopment and the environment in the twenty-first\\ncentury. New opportunities for such a partnership derive\\nfrom the globalization of industry and technology. Never\\nhave so many people experienced so much progress as in\\nthe past 10 years. In the year 2020, if the present trend\\ncontinues, the 15 countries with the largest gross national\\nproducts will include nine of today’s developing countries.\\nThe recipe is free markets, democracy, reliability of\\nthe judicial system, and integration into the global\\neconomy. This kind of good governance was rewarded with\\n$150 billion of private direct investment in 1995.\\nHowever, 90 per cent of that investment has gone to\\nonly 12 countries, and the gap between the poor and the\\nrest of the world continues to widen. The World Summit\\nfor Social Development put the number of poor people at\\n1.3 billion, nearly a quarter of the entire human race. This\\ncalls for action from both sides, help from the community\\nof nations and self-help on the part of the countries\\nconcerned. The one is the precondition for the other.\\nThis evening I am having another meeting with my\\nAfrican colleagues. I take a very keen interest in the\\nfuture of Europe’s vast neighbouring continent. We\\nshould not see only Africa’s negative side but the hopeful\\nsigns as well, and there are such signs. Democratization\\nis progressing, as shown by the fact that elections have\\ntaken place or are scheduled in 17 countries this year.\\nAverage economic growth has outpaced population\\ngrowth for the first time in many years. Life expectancy\\nhas increased by more than 25 per cent since 1960, and\\never more children are going to school.\\nGermany supports Africa’s integration into the world\\neconomy and the development of its own capabilities. The\\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\\nAfrica in the 1990s is a sound foundation for these\\nefforts. The Secretary-General’s United Nations System-\\nwide Initiative on Africa should likewise be used by all\\nconcerned as a basis for joint action.\\nHowever, much remains to be done. The ghastly\\nevents in Rwanda must not be repeated in Burundi. On\\nthe other hand, the United Nations should not be the\\norganization of first resort in every conflict situation. It\\ncannot solve every problem. Hence, the regional\\norganizations must assume a larger measure of\\nresponsibility.\\nThe Organization of African Unity, like the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has\\nmatured to a degree that commands respect. Germany,\\nwith one eye on Burundi, has to date provided one\\nmillion deutsche mark in support of that organization’s\\nconflict prevention mechanism. High hopes have been\\nplaced in the efforts of Julius Nyerere. The proposed\\nconference on the Great Lakes region has the support of\\nGermany and the European Union.\\nGermany will remain a good partner and friend to\\nthe nations of Africa. That will also be my message at the\\nforthcoming second European Union-Southern African\\nDevelopment Community (SADC) ministerial meeting in\\nWindhoek. The regionalization process in Africa is an\\n8\\n\\n\\nelement of hope. The outstanding example is southern\\nAfrica with the SADC. That region must become a\\nlocomotive for the whole continent.\\nOne neighbouring region whose fate touches Europe\\nis the Middle East. That is also the main reason for our\\nstrong commitment in the whole Middle East region. For\\nhistorical reasons, Germany has a special relationship with\\nIsrael; that remains unshakable. Bilaterally and through the\\nEuropean Union we are the most important donor for the\\nPalestinians. Germany will maintain that commitment. I\\nconfirmed this in my recent meetings with Israeli Foreign\\nMinister Levy and with President Yasser Arafat in Bonn.\\nTerrorists should not be given any chance to block the\\npath to peace. The sealing off of Gaza and the West Bank\\nmust be eased and discontinued as soon as possible. That\\nis our common endeavour. The struggle against terrorism\\nmust remain at the top of the international agenda. I\\nurgently appeal to all concerned to resume the peace\\nprocess without delay. There is no alternative.\\nIt has been estimated that the world’s population will\\nnumber about 10 billion in 2030. For their sake, for the\\nsake of our children and grandchildren, we must take steps\\ntoday to ensure that the Earth remains habitable. Peace and\\nhuman dignity, economic progress and protection of the\\nnatural foundations of life are inseparable. Without social\\njustice, without any vision for the world’s economic\\nprogress, we shall not be able to break the vicious circle of\\npoverty, environmental destruction and population\\nexplosion.\\nWe have no time to lose. Every second three babies\\nare born, and every year the world’s population increases\\nby nearly 100 million. All of them need food, clothing,\\nschools and a home. Every minute about 12 acres of\\ntropical rain forest are lost, an area the size of 40 football\\npitches.\\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry warned that the human race\\nhad not inherited the Earth from its fathers but had\\nborrowed it from its children. We became acutely aware of\\nthis at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. North and\\nSouth, East and West, are struggling to survive together in\\nspaceship Earth, whose blue protective shield is becoming\\nincreasingly fragile.\\nOur task now is to convert that environmental\\nawareness into environmental action. The year 1997 will be\\ncrucial for such action. The special session of the General\\nAssembly devoted to environment and development must\\nchart the course for the next millennium in order to\\nrestore the balance between man, nature and the economy.\\nGermany’s industrial community has voluntarily\\nundertaken to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by\\n20 per cent by the year 2005. Since 1990, Germany has\\nreduced those emissions by nearly 13 per cent and\\nthereby has led the way for the rest of the world.\\nWe are contributing 312 million deutsche mark to\\nthe pilot programme to protect Brazil’s tropical forests.\\nThat represents 60 per cent of the total contributions\\nmade so far. We appeal to the community of nations to\\nbecome more heavily involved in this programme. We\\ncan only succeed together or fail together.\\nAt the 1997 climate conference in Japan we must\\nachieve the objective agreed upon in Berlin 12 months\\nago: the adoption of a substantive and binding protocol to\\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the recent Geneva\\nconference, the great majority of nations came out in\\nfavour of specific targets and time limits. This is\\nencouraging.\\nI wish to thank all members once again for\\nsupporting our efforts to have the secretariat of the\\nFramework Convention on Climate Change established in\\nBonn. May I also ask members to support our proposal\\nthat the secretariat of the Framework Convention to\\nCombat Desertification likewise be located in Bonn, as it\\nhas to cooperate closely with the climate secretariat. The\\nUnited Nations will find that living and working\\nconditions in our country are good.\\nThe Rio Declaration on Environment and\\nDevelopment rightly makes people the focal point of all\\nefforts. We must continue to concentrate on combating\\npoverty and providing basic and vocational education.\\nEven if that is not the kind of subject that makes\\nheadlines, it is and will remain, together with\\npeacekeeping, one of our principal tasks.\\nEqual opportunities for women must not remain\\nmere theory.\\nNothing is more powerful than an idea whose time\\nhas come, is a saying that applies to human dignity and\\nhuman rights. The fall of the Berlin Wall showed that the\\npeople’s pursuit of freedom and personal happiness is, in\\nthe long run, stronger than any dictatorship. That is why\\nthe worldwide defence of human rights will likewise not\\nbe in vain.\\nIt all boils down to something quite natural: that we\\ntreat one another as humans and that we do not inflict upon\\nothers what we would not like to have inflicted upon\\nourselves. Murderers and torturers must not be allowed to\\nsleep peacefully. Mladic´ and Karadzic´, and all for whom\\narrest warrants have been issued, deserve to be brought\\nbefore the International Tribunal in The Hague. Germany\\ncalls for the early convening of a conference to establish an\\ninternational criminal court.\\nThere is a core of human rights that are common to us\\nall and that are universally valid. This fact received\\ninternational confirmation at the Vienna Conference on\\nHuman Rights. There can and should be no withdrawal\\nfrom that position.\\nWith the East-West confrontation now consigned to\\nthe past, intercultural dialogue assumes ever-greater\\nsignificance. Close to 2.5 million Muslims are living in\\nGermany. If only for this reason, it is of special importance\\nto develop greater mutual understanding between\\nChristianity and Islam.\\nA subject very close to my heart, as former Minister\\nof Justice, is the protection of our children, the weakest\\nmembers of society. Universal Children’s Day was\\nobserved on 20 September. Its motto: “Children have\\nrights”. What do those rights look like in reality? Every day\\n35,000 children die of hunger. Twelve million children do\\nnot live beyond the age of 5. Two million are forced into\\nprostitution. Two hundred thousand children around the\\nworld are used as soldiers in war. Millions of them are used\\nas cheap labour.\\nThe Stockholm conference on sexual abuse of children\\nhas awakened world opinion, and I should like to thank the\\nSwedish Government for having hosted and organized this\\nconference, which shocked us all into action. The atrocious\\nway many of our children are being treated is a disgrace —\\na disgrace — to our civilization. The Stockholm Plan of\\nAction must be followed by global action. This we owe to\\nour children. And I should like to make it very clear that\\nanyone who violates the weakest members of society —\\nchildren, that is — deserves to be outlawed by society.\\nPeace is not everything, but without peace everything\\nis nothing. These words originate from the time when East\\nand West faced each other armed to the teeth. In the\\nmeantime the nightmare of a nuclear inferno has been\\ndispelled. Yesterday’s signing of the Comprehensive\\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was another momentous step in\\nthis process, I believe, after half a century of international\\ndebate and protest against nuclear testing.\\nIn expressing my thanks to Australia I appeal to all\\nnations to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible. Since the\\nend of the Second World War upwards of 2,000 nuclear\\ntests have been carried out. We now have the chance to\\nput a stop to them once and for all. Anyone who rejects\\nsomething good because they will only accept something\\nperfect should be mindful of their responsibility to future\\ngenerations. We cannot force the atomic genie back into\\nthe bottle, but we owe it to our children and\\ngrandchildren to tame it — at least to tame it.\\nThe total abolition of all chemical weapons is of\\nsimilar consequence. The Chemical Weapons Convention\\nmust enter into force next spring. All nations, and\\nespecially those with the largest stockpiles of such\\nweapons, must meet their tremendous responsibility and\\nratify the Convention as soon as possible.\\nI should also like to touch upon an issue that I take\\na very personal, keen interest in, and that is a totally\\ndifferent kind of mass-destruction weapon: anti-personnel\\nmines. I travelled to Mozambique and Cambodia and took\\na look at the situation there. Hundreds of millions of such\\nanti-personnel mines are still in the ground. Year in, year\\nout they kill and maim 20,000 people and make entire\\nregions permanently uninhabitable. These treacherous\\ntools of murder must be banned.\\nGermany has completely renounced anti-personnel\\nmines and imposed a unilateral, open-ended ban on\\nexports. Residual stocks are to be destroyed by the end of\\n1997. In my Seven-Point Programme of Action I have\\nproposed a number of measures to maintain the\\nmomentum generated in Geneva. My main objective —\\nbecause I think the motto should be “first things first” —\\nis to improve the efficiency of mine clearance. We will\\nattend a conference in Canada very soon which deals with\\nthe political aspects of this issue, trying to ban land-\\nmines. But we should also at the same time try to\\nconcentrate on improving the efficiency of mine\\nclearance, that is, testing and using mechanical clearance\\nequipment. We quickly need machinery that can be mass-\\nproduced in order to remove this plague without harming\\npeople. I do not know whether anyone here has watched\\na mine-clearance operation. It is done by people and can\\nbe compared to trying to remove a sand-dune with a\\nspoon. I think it is incredible that highly developed\\n10\\n\\n\\nnations such as ours and many others are not able to\\nproduce a piece of machinery for a large-scale de-mining\\noperation. I want to focus the technical knowledge that we\\nhave to make this matter progress as quickly as possible.\\nIf we want to win peace, we must not only consider\\nconflict prevention; we must also pay greater attention to\\nthe situation after the termination of military hostilities.\\nPeace-building was the subject of the international\\nconference that we sponsored in Berlin in July. That\\nconference produced a number of interesting and tangible\\nresults, which we are making available to all Member\\nStates in the form of a report. Together with other countries\\nwe intend to submit to members during this session of the\\nGeneral Assembly a draft resolution on peace consolidation\\nthrough practical steps towards disarmament. Whether in\\nBosnia, Rwanda or Angola, all previous efforts will prove\\nin vain unless we can prevent a resurgence of violence.\\nMost of the burden is borne by the 26,000 or so Blue\\nHelmets and civilian personnel making up the peacekeeping\\nmissions, as well as by the countless courageous staff of\\nnon-governmental organizations who are doing their job all\\nover the world under difficult conditions. Speaking here in\\nthe United Nations, I should like to express my sincere\\nthanks to the non-governmental organizations. We are\\nproud of them.\\nIn our resolution marking the fiftieth anniversary of\\nthe United Nations, we solemnly undertook to pass on to\\nthe next millennium a United Nations organization equipped\\nand financed to perform its tasks. The greatest political\\nsignificance attaches to reform of the Security Council, in\\nwhose work we have been closely involved over the last\\ntwo years. This, the principal guardian of world peace, still\\nbears the countenance of the year 1945, but it now needs a\\nnew one for the year 2000. It is a question of enhancing\\nthat body’s legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness. After\\na three-year debate the time has come to put the various\\nelements together and start the restructuring process, to now\\nget things done after having analysed what can be done.\\nWe are pleased that a large number of Member States are\\nin favour of a permanent seat for Germany on the Security\\nCouncil. I really believe that the time is approaching when\\nthe General Assembly will have to decide.\\nWhat continues to require our immediate attention is\\nthe financial crisis. The Organization’s rationalization and\\nreform are indispensable and urgent. A glance at the books\\nis enough to tell us that. The regular United Nations budget\\nshows zero growth. The Secretariat has lost more than\\n1,000 posts, and further reductions will follow next year.\\nSo much has already been achieved.\\nI therefore take this opportunity to thank the\\nSecretary-General and his staff, who, both at headquarters\\nand in the field, continue to achieve outstanding results\\ndespite the reductions in their numbers and the constant\\nlack of funds. I should like to thank them very warmly.\\nI wish to add another word if I may. The United\\nNations, in its actions and decisions, can be only as\\nstrong as its Members allow it to be. People tend to\\noverlook that fact so readily when they criticize this\\nOrganization. I stress this point because I think that the\\noutside world has a distorted image of the United Nations.\\nThe United Nations is us, the Member States. We can\\nonly achieve what we want to achieve together.\\nI am afraid that I must repeat that we will have to\\nsave and rationalize further still. The need for reform is\\nno justification for refusing to pay contributions, however.\\nMoreover, special rights also imply special duties. The\\nGerman-American philosopher Hans Jonas said that\\nresponsibility is the most important principle of the new\\nage. Let us act in accordance with that principle.\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffI join my colleague,\\nMinister Dick Spring of Ireland, who spoke on behalf of\\nthe European Union, in congratulating you, Sir, on your\\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. As a\\nrepresentative with a long and distinguished career in\\nUnited Nations affairs, you are especially qualified to guide\\nour work in the coming year.\\nAs the present century draws to a close, we need to\\nask ourselves what shape the United Nations is in. Is it\\nready to face the world that lies ahead? Is it ready to meet\\nthe needs of generations that are still to be born? The\\nrealities confronting us today may still be the realities of\\ntomorrow, and they are formidable. We are witnessing\\nincreasing poverty, a growing rift between rich and poor,\\nmigration, population pressure, dwindling food stocks,\\nhazards to public health and the environment, drugs,\\nterrorism, internal conflicts and wholesale violations of\\nhuman rights: a daunting litany.\\nIn the face of these realities, to argue in favour of\\nreform of this Organization would be stating the obvious.\\nOf course we need reform. Clearly, the United Nations,\\nover the years, has turned into an institutional jungle\\nwhere outsiders do not venture, an organization which for\\nthat reason alone has lost much of its credibility and\\nwhich is badly in need of revitalization. We have to\\nreform. There is no alternative.\\nWe need reforms to get back what we have lost; that\\nis, not power, but authority. Power is wielded on many\\ndifferent levels, and by some States more than by others.\\nThere is not very much the United Nations can do to\\ninfluence Member States to make use of their power, and\\nthe power of the United Nations itself is rather limited.\\nBut what the United Nations was given a lot of 51 years\\nago, was authority: moral authority as well as legal\\nauthority, the kind of authority that comes with speaking\\non behalf of the world community, with voicing the\\npublic conscience and transcending vested interests.\\nIndeed, if this Organization is to approach the future from\\na position of strength and of confidence, and if we expect\\nthe nations of the world to rally behind the flag of the\\nUnited Nations, its authority needs to be intact. In fact, it\\nneeds to be growing.\\nWell, is it growing? Here a sobering note is due. At\\nthis critical juncture in its history, the United Nations is\\nseeing its authority, the one commodity it can never have\\ntoo much of, compromised and weakened; this is also the\\none commodity it cannot afford to have too little of. I\\nwould wish to highlight some of the manifestations of\\nhow the authority of the United Nations is on the wane\\nand offer some prospects for shoring it up again.\\nFirst, multilateralism, as such, is under pressure.\\nMany States no longer regard multilateral cooperation as\\na separate goal of their foreign policy, but instead as one\\nof many policy instruments which they can choose to\\napply or not to apply in accordance with their national\\ninterests. Alterative sources of international leadership\\nhave sprung up, and ad hoc coalitions are formed as the\\nneed arises. The United Nations is regarded more and\\nmore as a vehicle for safeguarding a nation’s particular\\ninterests, even in the short term, rather than as the\\npreferred avenue for solving pressing world-wide\\nproblems. This shopping-mall attitude towards the United\\nNations is in stark contrast with the lofty principles the\\nfounding fathers signed their names to.\\n16\\n\\n\\nGradual loss of authority is also caused by\\ndisappointment and frustration. The United Nations was\\nonce established as an ideal form of international\\ncooperation. Particularly after the end of the cold war,\\nexpectations rose as never before. For decades, the world\\nhad been dominated and the United Nations paralysed by\\ntwo power blocs at loggerheads. The United Nations could\\nnow finally begin to play the role originally laid out for it.\\nUnfortunately, this did not happen. Success stories\\nsuch as the United Nations involvement in Namibia, in El\\nSalvador and Mozambique were overshadowed by\\ndisappointment over the outcome of Missions Impossible\\nsuch as Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia. That the Member\\nStates themselves had decided to send the United Nations\\non those missions could not stem the erosion of authority\\nthat came with them.\\nFrustration has mounted over effectiveness and\\nefficiency, two qualities that have eluded the United\\nNations for a long time. It would be facile to blame the\\nlack of them on the Secretariat alone. The grinding manner\\nin which the intergovernmental machinery of this\\nOrganization works is a major factor as well.\\nCriticism abounds. The track record of the United\\nNations is in many ways impressive, to be sure, and even\\nmore so when we look at the broad spectrum of the entire\\nUnited Nations system. Its achievements in the fields of\\ninternational law, human rights, development, the\\npopulation crisis, health care, the position of women, labour\\nconditions and disarmament are just random examples. In\\nreality, the list is long. Yet somehow United Nations-\\nbashing has become the craze these days and even a tool of\\ncampaign rhetoric, or else it serves to distract attention\\nfrom internal problems. Nevertheless, the United Nations\\nmoral authority is sapped by the real and the imagined and\\nby criticism justified or unjustified.\\nThen there is the financial situation. From the early\\ndays, payment or non-payment of contributions has been\\nindicative of the United Nations approval rating. The level\\nof arrears we are now facing is, however, without\\nprecedent. Sadly, it is in large part a reflection of declining\\nconfidence and belief in the Organization’s potential. The\\npresent financial turmoil is not primarily the cause of the\\nUnited Nations predicament, but rather a consequence of it,\\na symptom. Of course, empty coffers will lead to less\\noutput eventually. Less output would undermine authority\\neven further. Less authority in turn leads to fewer\\npayments, which again would exacerbate the financial\\ncrisis. And so we may see the United Nations caught in a\\ndownward spiral. The current payment habits of some\\nMember States amount to a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\nWorse, they betray the very principles on which the\\nUnited Nations was founded. The absence of full, prompt\\nand unconditional payments will further erode the United\\nNations authority, the same authority those very States\\nhelped to bestow on the Organization 50 years ago.\\nIf there is one policy area in which the United\\nNations has lost much of its authority and stands to loose\\neven more, it is peace and security. Take Burundi. Today,\\nthe humanitarian and political situation there is alarming.\\nWe are witnessing a creeping genocide. Terror prevails.\\nIn the past few months alone, thousands of innocent men,\\nwomen and children have lost their lives. An explosion of\\ngenocide is still a real threat. We cannot allow the\\noccurrence of another disaster such as that which took\\nplace in Rwanda in 1994. In that year, we claimed that\\nwe could hardly have seen it coming. In the case of\\nBurundi, there will be no such excuse. The writing is\\nclearly on the wall. If we fail once again and a second\\ngenocide does take place, the United Nations will suffer\\nits most dramatic loss of authority ever.\\nWhat can we do to enhance the effectiveness of the\\nUnited Nations and hence to help it regain the authority\\nit needs in order to fulfil its mandate? How can we\\nreverse the downward spiral?\\nIf the United Nations is to be effective, the various\\ninstruments at the disposal of the international community\\nhave to be used in an integrated manner. This holds true\\nparticularly in the area of peace and security. In this area,\\npolitical, military, socio-economic, electoral and\\nhumanitarian assistance, as well as reconstruction and\\ndevelopment, will have to be applied in harmony. Hence,\\nan integrated approach is the only way effectively to\\nprevent and combat conflicts. The United Nations needs\\nto be on the ground when it matters and where it matters.\\nThis is the lesson that can be drawn from recent crises in\\nAfrica — such as in Rwanda and Somalia — where the\\ninternational response to tragic violence became\\nineffective through lack of coherence.\\nPreventive diplomacy, on the one hand, and post-\\nconflict peace-building, on the other, require increased\\nattention. More than ever, the United Nations should\\nfocus on the prevention of conflicts and, when conflicts\\ndo occur nevertheless, on defusing them at an early stage.\\nWhen I addressed this Assembly two years ago, I\\ndrew attention to the United Nations capability, or rather\\n17\\n\\n\\nthe lack of it, to respond adequately and in a timely manner\\nto acute situations of conflict. Some progress has been\\nmade since then — progress in the form of modest\\nintermediate steps that would in the longer run lead to a\\nUnited Nations better equipped to maintain peace and\\nsecurity. Today, there is a growing number of countries that\\ntake part in the United Nations standby-arrangements\\nsystem and in the efforts of a group of nations to establish\\na United Nations high-readiness brigade under this system.\\nThe transparency of the Security Council’s decision-making\\nconcerning peace-operations has improved. A rapidly\\ndeployable headquarters will soon be added to the United\\nNations peace-keeping capacity.\\nThe future of conflict prevention is linked to the\\nUnited Nations power to combat yet another threat to its\\nauthority: impunity. Does the world community actually\\nhave sufficient means to bring to justice those guilty of war\\ncrimes or crimes against humanity? As the cases of Burundi\\nand Liberia sadly illustrate, the prospect of impunity\\nprovides an open invitation to commit crimes without fear\\nof retribution and stands in the way of future reconciliation\\nand reconstruction. The Tribunals on the former Yugoslavia\\nand on Rwanda represent the single most important\\nendeavour of the international community since Nuremberg\\nto adjudicate war crimes and crimes against humanity. We\\ncannot let it fail. Yet the Yugoslavia Tribunal will face a\\nserious problem so long as it cannot gain custody of more\\nof the many people it has indicted. Soon, the present\\ncircumstances will erode its authority and, indeed, that of\\nthe United Nations as a whole.\\nMy country feels that the establishment of ad hoc\\nTribunals once again underlines the need for the speedy\\ncreation of a permanent international criminal court. Once\\nthis Court has been established, it will become even more\\nimperative that those accused of such crimes actually be\\nbrought to trial. The United Nations should enhance its\\ncapacity to ensure the apprehension, extradition and trial of\\nthose so accused.\\nIf there is one area of the United Nations where moral\\nand legal authority play crucial roles, it is that of human\\nrights. Here, the record of the Organization is impressive,\\nbut still more can and should be done and new challenges\\nlie in store.\\nIncreased attention for human rights will increase the\\nmoral authority of the United Nations. In this regard, its\\nauthority should rest firmly on the Universal Declaration,\\nadopted by this Organization in 1948\\n“as a common standard of achievement for all\\npeoples and all nations” (resolution 217 A (III),\\neighth preambular para.) —\\nin other words, a universal framework. Forty-five years\\nlater, in Vienna, the universality of human rights was\\nonce again expounded by the United Nations membership\\nas we know it today.\\nYet, universality of human rights is under pressure.\\nEver since Vienna, the discussion of what is called\\ncultural particularities seems to have chipped away at it.\\nSome Governments claim that their nation’s human-rights\\nperformance cannot be held up to the same standards as\\nother nations’ due to differences in their historical,\\ncultural and religious backgrounds.\\nLet us make no mistake. There are differences in the\\nway people look at human rights in the various regions of\\nthe world and the ongoing dialogue in the United Nations\\nwould be ill-served if we chose to deny that there were\\nany differences at all. True, religious and ethical values,\\ncultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions should\\nbe borne in mind at all times and, by themselves, are\\neven protected by the Universal Declaration. But their\\nlink to human rights as such and to the concept of\\nuniversality is a very particular one. The international\\ncommunity has expressed it nowhere more accurately than\\nin the Platform for Action adopted in Beijing one year\\nago. As we agreed in Beijing, rather than detracting from\\nthe ambit of universality, cultural differences should\\ncontribute to the full enjoyment of human rights. The\\nStates Members of this Organization agreed in Vienna\\nthat, regardless of their political, economic and cultural\\nsystems, it is their duty to promote and protect all human\\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\\nIncreased emphasis calls for more financial\\nresources. A larger part of the United Nations budget\\nshould be devoted to human rights. This, in turn, will\\nenhance the moral authority of the Organization in the\\neyes of the multitudes who are still deprived of their\\nhuman rights today. Letting the programme wither away\\nwill produce the opposite effect.\\nThe General Assembly, being the only plenary organ\\nof the United Nations, is the most conspicuous.\\nCredibility and authority are very much tied to the\\nAssembly’s performance. Sadly, this body sees many of\\n18\\n\\n\\nits resolutions ignored. We should vigorously seek to infuse\\nnew vitality into the Assembly’s proceedings and in the\\nrelevance of its achievements.\\nTwo weeks ago, the Assembly effectively lived up to\\nits responsibility by adopting the Comprehensive Nuclear-\\nTest-Ban Treaty by an overwhelming majority. The\\nadoption of the Treaty by this world body lends authority\\nto the new norm outlawing nuclear testing. My country\\nfeels privileged that it was called upon to preside over the\\nnegotiations. Adoption of the Treaty contributes to the\\nultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons, a goal to which\\nmy country remains fully committed. We aim for a\\npropitious entry into force. But even in the absence of entry\\ninto force, the authority of the United Nations will make it\\nmore difficult for any State to act against the Treaty.\\nIncreased attention should be given to those activities\\nof the United Nations which are not of a strictly political\\nnature or concerned with security, namely, the socio-\\neconomic aspects and the strengthening of those parts of\\nthe United Nations system dealing with such matters as\\npoverty, population, food security, urbanization, equality of\\nwomen and the environment. These areas are crucial for the\\nfuture of the world and for the quality of life on this planet.\\nThese are also areas where the Organization is especially\\nqualified to identify and debate the problems and where it\\nhas set up an impressive array of operational activities. A\\nseries of world conferences in recent years has helped to\\nupgrade the authority of the United Nations system. They\\nhave set an agenda for the United Nations and the Member\\nStates to follow during the coming decades. The World\\nFood Summit in November should do the same. The\\nSummit faces the awesome problem of a world that may\\nhave to feed 10 billion people by the time the United\\nNations is 100 years old.\\nThere is, of course, a risk that expectations have been\\nraised too high once more and that disappointment will lead\\nonce more to loss of authority. The United Nations and its\\nMember States have to make sure this does not happen.\\nThe United Nations will play a major role in the fields of\\nadvocacy, coordination and monitoring. Although the\\nUnited Nations itself contributes to implementation through\\nits field operations, the Member States bear the primary\\nresponsibility for full implementation at the national level.\\nTogether, they can succeed in ensuring that the world\\ncommunity reaches the goals it has set for itself.\\nThe authority of the United Nations is at stake. It will\\nnot disappear in a clap of thunder. It will die with a\\nwhimper. It stands to fade away gradually, without at any\\ntime making alarm bells ring, and with it, the\\nOrganization may well slide into the margins of the world\\nscene. The United Nations needs a new sense of direction\\nand purpose to become, once again, a beacon for mankind\\nas intended by the authors of the Charter. That requires a\\nsustained effort of all Members of this Organization.\\nThere is little time left. Let us use it well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffFirst of all, allow me\\nto subscribe to the statement delivered this morning by the\\nForeign Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Jacques Poos, on\\nbehalf of the European Union. In particular, Sir, I wish to\\njoin him in his congratulations to you on your election to\\nthe presidency of the General Assembly.\\nAs the year 2000 draws closer, our feelings somehow\\nmake us ponder more keenly the achievements and\\nmisfortunes of the present century, and make us look ahead\\nto the next one. As I do this, central to my thoughts is the\\nUnited Nations, an institution created when I was an\\nadolescent, at the end of a war whose horrors were just\\nthen coming to light. I remember having been elated at the\\ntime about the purposes and principles of the new\\nOrganization, and I remember how intrigued I was to see\\nthat, in a way, devastation and despair had given rise to the\\nbelief that a better world could yet be built, a world marked\\nby peace, development and respect for human rights,\\nnotions I was just beginning to learn about. Soon enough,\\nI came to realize that such a world would be rather longer\\nin the making than the Charter had led me to hope; that old\\nquestions were giving way to new ones; that the United\\nNations was not a panacea for all the troubles of mankind;\\nand, more to the point, that the United Nations could never\\nbe stronger than its Member States collectively willed it to\\nbe.\\nYet somehow my expectations remained, expectations\\nwhich I shared with a growing audience around the globe,\\nand which one generation was passing on to the next.\\nRightly or wrongly, nations and individuals, Governments,\\ncivil society and the public at large: they all have\\nexpectations about what the United Nations can do for\\nthem, and about how it might change their lives and their\\ndestiny for the better.\\nThe question then is not so much whether the United\\nNations can meet all of those expectations. For it cannot,\\nand it probably should not even try. The United Nations\\nhas neither the mandate, nor the resources, nor the power\\nto be the world’s keeper. The question is rather how we\\ncan exploit the strong points of the Charter, how we can\\nmake the United Nations play a role that only the United\\nNations can play, and how we can better equip the\\nOrganization to do more by doing what it does better.\\nWith that in mind, I wish to highlight three matters this\\nafternoon: the fitness of the Organization; the potential of\\nthe United Nations to manage crises in the wider context\\nof development; and the Organization’s action in the field\\nof human rights.\\nPart of the reason why the United Nations has\\nproblems in meeting expectations is what it has turned\\ninto over the past 30 years: an amazing structure of\\nboards and committees populated by a growing\\nmembership and assisted by an army of civil servants. For\\nthat reason alone, the Organization has lost credibility.\\nEfforts to streamline and revitalize the Organization are\\ntherefore long overdue. United Nations reform is a must.\\nThe proposals put forward by the Secretary-General are\\nan important first step in that process, as the Foreign\\nMinister of Luxembourg, Mr. Poos, said this morning, a\\nprocess that will have to incorporate more ambitious ideas\\nas it unfolds. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports\\nthe Secretary-General in his reform drive, we applaud the\\nfact that he has made reform his number-one agenda item,\\nand we welcome the reform package Mr. Kofi Annan has\\nput in our care.\\nBut we should get on with it. The world cannot\\nafford to wait. We are looking at an Organization that is\\nfar behind on its maintenance schedule. Yet over the past\\nthree years, the reform debate has inched forward as if\\noblivious to the need to produce results. Fortunately, the\\nSecretary-General has injected new momentum into the\\ndebate, and we should all welcome this.\\nAs we are about to engage in this “Reform\\nAssembly”, as the Secretary-General has called it, we\\nshould be conscious of the underlying concerns that have\\nsurfaced in the reform debate from time to time. These\\nconcerns are real, and dismissing them would jeopardize\\na promising outcome for the present session. Indeed,\\nvarious groups of nations have doubts about what other\\ngroups of nations are ultimately aiming for in this\\nexercise. Developing countries have even expressed\\nmisgivings about the reform process as a whole. Some of\\nthem are clearly afraid that major Western Governments\\n15\\n\\n\\nare out to recast the United Nations as an institution that\\nwould run on the lowest possible budget and concentrate on\\npeacekeeping, humanitarian aid and human rights. Another\\nconcern is that the development programme of this\\nOrganization — perhaps its single most important\\nachievement over the past 30 years — might actually suffer\\nas a result of reform.\\nUnderstandably, many nations see the decline in recent\\nyears of official aid levels as the writing on the wall. They\\nare disheartened by the empty promises of Rio de Janeiro\\nin 1992. Moreover, they are worried about the current\\nfinancial crisis of the United Nations. And finally, a handful\\nof nations describe the Secretary-General’s proposals as a\\n“northern” package — one that caters mainly to the needs\\nof the industrialized world.\\nInstead, developing nations would wish to see the\\nUnited Nations strengthened in what to them is perhaps its\\nmost critical field of action, a field of action that\\ncorresponds to one of the main purposes mentioned in the\\nCharter: social and economic development. They rightly\\nargue that if the United Nations membership wants to be\\nserious about that objective, it needs to equip the\\nOrganization accordingly. And so, in their view, more\\nresources should flow into the Organization. Before\\nconsenting to change anything, they are inclined to play it\\nsafe and to hold on to what is there.\\nThis line of thought, assuming I am reading it\\ncorrectly, calls for comments. My first remark is that,\\nclearly, the Secretary-General was well-advised in having\\nmost of his package focus on the economic and social\\nsectors. This is indeed the area that commands the widest\\ninterest among the membership. If we look at the merits of\\nthe package, it seems fair to say that many industrialized\\nnations might have wanted to see more ambitious and\\ncomprehensive proposals. Still, speaking for the\\nNetherlands Government, I would argue that the present\\npackage of reform measures is well-directed, substantial and\\nworthwhile. Evidently, the Secretary-General, on the basis\\nof consultations which only he could undertake, has\\nconcluded that the contents of the package represent the\\nmaximum of what is achievable in the present state of play.\\nAnd we should all accept that as a given.\\nFurthermore, it is important to remember that reform\\nmight strengthen the development sector of the United\\nNations to the point where it can actually deliver better\\nservice with the resources that are presently available. This\\nexercise is not about cutting costs. Yet a leaner and meaner\\nOrganization might give better value for the money. At the\\nsame time, we welcome the idea of a development\\ndividend, as put forward by the Secretary-General.\\nA stronger development sector may help make the\\nUnited Nations a more attractive Organization not only to\\nrecipients, but to donor countries as well. Voluntary\\ncontributions should not come only from the same small\\ngroup of traditional donors year after year. For a long\\ntime now, the Netherlands has been among the top\\ncontributors to the United Nations system, and we intend\\nto remain so. We appreciate the spectacular gesture by\\nMr. Ted Turner. But donor contributions should also\\ncome from those nations that fall far below the 0.7 per\\ncent mark, as well as from newly industrialized countries\\nin Asia and elsewhere.\\nFinally, all Member States should become current\\nand stay current on their financial obligations under the\\nregular and peacekeeping budgets; and payments should\\nbe prompt, in full and certainly without conditions.\\nAll in all, the heart of the matter is not about core\\nconcepts and not about mindset; it is about trust. It is\\nabout feeling comfortable with the idea that among 185\\nMember States, a difference of views is inevitable,\\nparticularly when they are asked to discuss such a wide-\\nranging matter as the future of this Organization.\\nWe have arrived at a crossroads where we face a\\ncritical choice. This is a moment when we have to rise\\nabove the level of squabbling over details in working\\ngroups. No doubt, we all have a point to raise, a question\\nto ask and a change to make. But that avenue would lead\\nus nowhere, for soon enough the package would fall\\napart. Now is the time to start trusting each other. This is\\na time for vision and political courage. We, as statesmen,\\nshould be ready to accept our responsibility in this regard,\\nto join forces and to forge a breakthrough. We should all\\nrise to the occasion and accept the package of the\\nSecretary-General as it is before us now and work out the\\ndetails and implementation later. Endorsement in general\\nterms needs to be expressed before we all adjourn next\\nDecember. Without such endorsement, the momentum in\\nthe reform process will be lost.\\nWe, the Member States of the United Nations,\\npledged ourselves, in the words of the Charter:\\n“to take effective collective measures for the\\nprevention and removal of threats to the\\npeace”.\\n16\\n\\n\\nNext to the United Nations development effort,\\npeacekeeping and peace-building are perhaps the most\\nvisible part of what the United Nations does — an\\nimpression refreshed by Cable News Network (CNN)\\nalmost daily. More importantly, those who are on the run,\\nwho are afraid for their lives, who watch their homesteads\\ninvaded, who are occupied and repressed, who look\\nstarvation and genocide in the face — they have\\nexpectations of the United Nations. They expect the\\nOrganization to bail them out.\\nWe need to improve the capacity of the United\\nNations to deal with crises, be they military, political or\\nhumanitarian ones, whether man-made or not. There is\\nconsiderable room for improvement here, as illustrated by\\nthe situations in Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda and Zaire. As we\\nspeak, innocent blood is flowing in many places around the\\nworld. Yet all too often the United Nations remains\\nimpotent. We cannot allow this to continue. Here again lies\\na major area where reform is indispensable, and the\\nSecretary-General has duly underlined this.\\nA number of Member States, including the Kingdom\\nof the Netherlands, have been trying to develop the concept\\nof a standby high-readiness brigade within the framework\\nof the United Nations standby agreements. They have been\\nmaking modest progress over the last three years. A rapidly\\ndeployable headquarters is now being established.\\nTomorrow a small group of nations will informally\\ndeliberate on how to promote further steps. Several other\\ninitiatives are under way, including regional ones. Given the\\ncomplexities, this is going to be an incremental process, but\\none where we cannot afford to let up.\\nThe real test is where to position peacekeeping in the\\nwider context of the overall concerns of the United Nations.\\nOur agenda should be wider and should include conflict\\nprevention and peace-building.\\nThe difficulty we need to address here is how to\\nintegrate different policy instruments — political, military,\\nrelief, rehabilitation and social and economic development\\n— into one comprehensive framework. Crises require a\\ncoherent and effective international response, a response\\nthat should integrate preventive diplomacy, political\\nmediation and humanitarian relief, but also social action,\\neconomic alternatives and cultural communication. In sum:\\ndevelopment.\\nOf course, prevention is the key. The United Nations\\ncan be much more effective when we invest in prevention.\\nDiplomacy, economic sanctions, arms embargoes and\\npolitical pressure will reduce risk and costs as compared\\nto military intervention in an escalated conflict. We could\\navoid the loss of life and escape generalized human\\nmisery. As a result of timely prevention, we could also\\navoid the immense costs for rehabilitation, resettlement\\nand reconstruction that arise after violence is over.\\nMilitary intervention, under United Nations auspices, for\\nhumanitarian purposes may be necessary in certain\\nconflict situations. But it should always be a means of\\nlast resort. Intervention implies that prevention has failed.\\nThe link between development on the one hand and\\npeace and security on the other is a tenuous one in the\\nUnited Nations system. Yet experience has proved that\\nmaking the link is imperative. We need to find the best\\ncombination of conflict management, humanitarian\\nassistance and social and economic programmes to pave\\nthe way for sustainable development and for sustainable\\npeace.\\nIn San Francisco we promised to promote and\\nencourage\\n“respect for human rights and for fundamental\\nfreedoms for all”.\\nIt is a pledge we will have to renew again and again,\\nperhaps indefinitely. Yet such a pledge may not\\ndegenerate into lipservice. Commitments must be turned\\ninto reality; obligations must be implemented. We cannot\\nlet our guard down as we face reports on violations of\\nhuman rights. Torture is still being practised on a wide\\nscale. People continue to disappear. Arrest and detention\\nwithout cause take place routinely. And freedom of the\\npress is non-existent in too many countries.\\nStill, we recognize that human rights are in better\\nshape worldwide than they were 10 years ago, and\\ncertainly 50 years ago. Totalitarian regimes have all but\\ndisappeared; democracy is on the rise. Also, there is more\\ninterest than ever before in the triangle of democracy,\\ngood governance and human rights.\\nToday, human rights are well established as an\\nimportant objective in their own right and a major field of\\nactivity for the United Nations. But, perhaps more\\nimportant, human rights have become a leitmotif in a\\nwide variety of other areas of United Nations policy, from\\nsustainable development to population, from trade to\\nhumanitarian aid, and from peacekeeping to human\\nsettlements. That human rights is a “cross-cutting” issue\\nis evident from the reform proposals of the Secretary-\\n17\\n\\n\\nGeneral and from the way he has revised the top\\nmanagement structure in the Secretariat — both of which\\nwe welcome warmly.\\nExpectations on what the United Nations can achieve\\nin the field of human rights have run high, among victims\\nof human-rights violations, among mothers of the\\ndisappeared, among grass-roots groups, and among\\nnon-governmental organizations. Then again, there are\\nGovernments that expect the United Nations to stay out of\\ntheir precincts entirely: Governments that accept the\\nuniversality of human rights, but only as a debating point;\\nGovernments that accept the United Nations actions against\\nhuman rights-violations, but only at a theoretical level and\\nnot when it concerns them.\\nAll in all, the instruments the United Nations can\\napply have become the core of an extensive machinery that\\nin many cases has worked strikingly well. Examples are\\nnumerous and expanding. I refer to such diverse methods\\nas international dialogue, the integration of human rights\\nactivities into cooperation arrangements, the work of human\\nrights field offices, human rights education and\\nstrengthening regional supervisory machinery.\\nMore recently, a new High Commissioner for Human\\nRights took up her position. If this is indeed the age of\\nhuman rights, as the Secretary-General says, then\\nMrs. Mary Robinson will be one of its key personalities.\\nWe wish her courage and wisdom in her new assignment,\\nand she can be sure of our commitment.\\nOne major platform in the realization of human rights\\nand the international administration of justice is soon to\\ntake its definitive shape. Next summer, a diplomatic\\nconference will convene in Rome — we should all be\\ngrateful to the Italian Government for hosting it — that\\nwill, hopefully, adopt a convention establishing an\\ninternational criminal court. Once established, the court will\\nbe the natural counterpart to the International Court of\\nJustice. My Government is looking forward with\\nanticipation to this new offspring in the international legal\\norder, and I take pride in announcing that my country is\\noffering to house the seat of the court, in the city of The\\nHague.\\nThe fitness of the United Nations as an Organization,\\nits capacity to manage crises in the wider context of\\ndevelopment, and its action in the field of human rights are\\nareas of ongoing concern to all Member States. This\\nAssembly will continue to address them, either on their\\nown merits or in the context of United Nations reform. The\\nUnited Nations is expected to perform in these areas and\\nto produce results. Yet there is only one way this is going\\nto happen: if all of us join forces, join forces to make the\\nUnited Nations a viable and credible institution, join\\nforces to make it a centre for harmonizing the actions of\\nnations in the attainment of these common ends. For only\\nthen will we keep the promise of San Francisco.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffI congratulate\\nyou, Mr. President, on assuming your responsible office.\\nMajor decisions are to be taken at this session and I wish\\nyou good fortune in your conduct of the proceedings.\\nI wish to thank Ambassador Razali for his\\nexceptional commitment. He has made us all aware of the\\ngreat responsibility we carry during this phase of reform.\\nThe Secretary-General, through the impressive manner in\\nwhich he presented his reform proposals, has\\nre-emphasized that responsibility.\\nNowhere else are we so acutely aware as at the\\nUnited Nations General Assembly that, regardless of our\\norigins or the colour of our skin, we have a common\\ndestiny and that we all, North and South, the small\\ncountries and the big countries, need one another.\\nMillions of people all over the world, especially our\\nyouth, ask themselves whether we politicians and\\ndelegates from 185 nations have drawn the right\\nconclusions from this; whether we can summon the\\npolitical will for joint action to improve their security, to\\ngive them better opportunities in life, and to safeguard\\ntheir rights, or whether we will go on wasting and\\ndestroying the natural sources of human life at their\\n10\\n\\n\\nexpense. Those of us with adult children know how\\nsceptical their generation have become about the\\ncapabilities of the governing class. That is good reason for\\nall of us to stop, think and take action, and to do so here\\nand now.\\nThe world about which we are talking here today and\\nthe world which we participate in shaping is not ours alone.\\nWe have to preserve it for future generations as well. And\\nthis we can achieve only through a united effort. For we are\\nonly one world community that has to survive together.\\nThere is only one boat for all, our vulnerable blue planet,\\nand there is only one common future, good or bad. That is\\nthe reality we face as we cross over into the third\\nmillennium and it is the reason why policies deriving from\\na sense of responsibility are not utopian. Indeed, in our age\\nthey are the only realistic approach.\\nThe world organization’s programmes and funds, that\\nis to say, those of the United Nation’s Children’s Fund\\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme,\\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the World Food\\nProgramme, together dispense more than $4.6 billion a year\\nin the form of economic and social aid. That comes to\\nabout 80 cents for every person on earth. By contrast, in\\n1994 the world’s Governments spent about $767 billion on\\narms, which was roughly $134 per person. This gross\\ndisproportion is intolerable.\\nI believe that we must all look beyond the rim of our\\nown national interests. There is no more time to lose. We\\ncannot simply come here, make and listen to speeches and\\nthen return to business as usual for another 12 months. We\\nhave a duty and responsibility to leave our children and\\ngrandchildren a world which is worthy of humankind. And\\nthat means doing something about it now, today. We must\\nprotect the earth’s atmosphere by reducing greenhouse-gas\\nemissions. We must ban lethal anti-personnel landmines by\\njoining in the Ottawa process. We cannot accept that we\\nhave hundreds of millions of anti-personnel landmines still\\nin place in the ground of many, many countries in this\\nworld of ours.\\nWe must halt the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction, and we must streamline the United Nations\\nOrganization. But above all, we must pay our contributions\\non time and in full. These are the criteria which show\\nwhether we are living up to our responsibility.\\nThe opportunity for effective action is there. Despite\\ncarping criticism, international cooperation within the\\nUnited Nations framework is working. Malnutrition and\\nundernourishment have been reduced by a third since\\n1960 and illiteracy by 50 per cent. Most of the credit for\\nthis, no doubt, goes to the United Nations. Infant\\nmortality has been halved in the same period — a great\\nachievement by UNICEF.\\nBetween 1990 and 1995 the world population\\nincreased by 1.48 per cent, considerably less than the 1.72\\nper cent growth between 1985 and 1990. This nourishes\\nthe hope that we have got over the hump of the\\npopulation explosion. Again, this is a big achievement\\nlargely attributable to the work of the United Nations\\nPopulation Fund.\\nMuch, I am pleased to note, has also been done to\\nimprove the situation of women. This is important\\nbecause with all the tremendous social challenges we\\nface, the success of our efforts depends heavily on them.\\nThey are the natural advocates of future generations. That\\nis why one of our main objectives still is to ensure they\\nhave equal rights, not only on paper but also in practice.\\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna,\\nthe Earth Summit in Rio, the International Conference on\\nPopulation and Development in Cairo, the Summit for\\nSocial Development in Copenhagen and the World\\nConference on Women in Beijing have demonstrated that\\nthe strategies for creating a better and more equitable\\nworld are in place. What is missing is the political will to\\nput them into effect. We must learn to give common\\ninterests priority over national interests.\\nWe must start to think not only of the present but of\\nthe future as well. The first step — and I think it cannot\\nbe underlined enough — is to reform and strengthen the\\nOrganization which embodies all these objectives: the\\nUnited Nations, our United Nations.\\nThere has been enough talk. Time is running out. At\\nthis fifty-second session, the General Assembly must\\nmake decisions. The backlog of reforms must be dealt\\nwith during this session.\\nTrue, Governments and politicians don’t possess a\\nmagic wand with which to put the world in order. And I\\nreadily admit, as a politician, that it is disappointing to\\ndiscover how relatively little we ourselves can change,\\neven in high positions, and I take it that it is the same\\nwith the others present here. But that does not absolve us\\nfrom the responsibility to do everything in our power to\\nbring about necessary change and progress.\\n11\\n\\n\\nThere is more than enough to be done. The world is\\nstill profoundly unjust. From the moment of their birth,\\nmillions of people have hardly any chance of leading a life\\nin conditions worthy of the human race. According to\\nUNICEF, more than 20 million children all over the world\\nare on the move. About 300,000 children were killed in the\\nRwanda massacres. As a result of the 17-year-old war in\\nAfghanistan, another 280,000 or so have died from\\nundernourishment and disease. The civil war in Cambodia\\nhas made some 350,000 children orphans. Every 90 minutes\\na child is maimed by a landmine.\\nYet it is on our children, the weakest members of any\\nsociety, be it in the North or the South of our planet, that\\nthe world’s future and hopes depend. They are the weakest\\nmembers of any society. They are little people who need\\nbig rights. How much worse off would they be if there\\nwere no United Nations? What would become of the\\nworld’s conscience? Who would demand consideration for\\nand solidarity with such children if we allowed this\\nOrganization to decline?\\nAt this moment about 25,000 soldiers, civilians and\\nmembers of non-governmental organizations are serving the\\ncause of peace around the globe. All of them deserve our\\nthanks and appreciation.\\nA week ago today five Germans, including the Deputy\\nof the High Representative, Ambassador Gerd Wagner, five\\nAmericans, a Briton and a Pole lost their lives in a tragic\\naccident. We mourn their loss and share the grief of their\\nfamilies. Their deaths are an admonition to redouble our\\nefforts for peace. They wanted to help people in need and\\nin doing so brought a ray of hope to Bosnia and to the\\npeople working on the ground. That hope must not be\\nextinguished.\\nLast Saturday I attended the memorial service in\\nSarajevo. I have visited the region more than once, and the\\ninner conflict among the people was again obvious. As\\nbefore, the main obstacles to lasting peace in the region are\\nhatred and fear among the various ethnic groups. On the\\nother hand, most Bosnians, in spite of the terrible events of\\nrecent years, realize there is no future for them and their\\nchildren if the hatred and fear are not overcome, despite all\\nthe terrible things that have been done, despite the rapes\\nand the “ethnic cleansing”.\\nThat is why I am speaking out here today — to appeal\\nto all political leaders in Bosnia to change their attitude and\\nto mount a reconciliation campaign. The international\\ncommunity has provided assistance, making millions of\\ndollars available. We have done a lot. We are very\\ncommitted on the ground, and we want to see the results\\nof what we have done. We believe that those who live in\\nsecurity and peace have an obligation to help others.\\nSo far more than 300 troops have sacrificed their\\nlives for the cause of peace in Bosnia. My country\\nalone — Germany — has spent more than 17 billion\\nmarks on the peace process and on the more than 350,000\\nasylum-seekers in Germany coming from Kosovo. That is\\na lot of money, and those on whom we spend it will have\\nto react in some way and have to give us a clear sign of\\ntheir willingness to implement the agreements.\\nBut outside help, including military support, cannot\\nbe provided indefinitely. And on no account — I want to\\nbe unequivocal about this — will it be given to those who\\nthwart peace and reconciliation. Attempts to undermine\\npeace, to incite the people and to torpedo the\\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement, especially in\\nRepublika Srpska — must stop.\\nI appeal to all political factions in the region to use\\nwhat time remains to launch a new and serious attempt to\\nsettle their differences and to see to it that Karadzic and\\nother alleged war criminals and enemies of peace are\\nbrought before the Hague Tribunal. These people must\\nnot be allowed to sleep peacefully. But this demand must\\nbe made by the international community, not just\\nGermany: these people must not be allowed to sleep\\npeacefully.\\nWe Europeans have done quite a lot this year to\\nimprove the situation on our continent in order to secure\\na peaceful future for coming generations. Nations that\\nbelong together are now growing together, and that in a\\nregion that for centuries was divided and at war with\\nitself. The European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\\nOrganization are gradually opening up to Europe’s new\\ndemocracies, while Russia and Ukraine are forming a\\nnew, close partnership with both organizations.\\nAnd let the world be prepared. In 1999 we\\nEuropeans, right on schedule and in conformity with\\nbinding stability criteria, will introduce the Euro, the\\ncommon European currency. The enlargement of the\\nEuropean Union and the introduction of the Euro are\\nhistoric steps to safeguard the future for coming\\ngenerations, steps that hardly anyone would have thought\\npossible only 10 years ago. And mark my words: there\\nwill be no going back in Europe.\\n12\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, we are aware that Europe\\nconstitutes only a small section of the much larger global\\nconstruction site. Everywhere the harbingers of the new era\\nare knocking on the door. Nothing is like it used to be, yet\\nthe hopes and wishes of citizens everywhere have remained\\nthe same. They want peace and work. They want a roof\\nover their heads, protection from crime, and schools for\\ntheir children.\\nThus the aims and ideals enshrined in the Charter are\\njust as valid as they were in 1945: peace, sustainable\\neconomic and social development, protection of human\\nrights and democracy. These aims form a whole, and there\\nis no order of preference.\\nEighty per cent of United Nations activities focus on\\nworld poverty, and rightly so, because this is the big\\nproblem that has remained unsolved since the ending of the\\nEast-West confrontation. Nearly a quarter of the world’s\\npopulation — 1.3 billion people — live in poverty, while\\n840 million suffer from chronic undernourishment. In the\\nAgenda for Development we have adopted the right course\\nfor the fight against poverty: good governance, market\\neconomy, the rule of law, security for the citizen, regional\\ncooperation and international integration.\\nFollowing the lead of the Association of South-East\\nAsian Nations countries (ASEAN), the Southern Cone\\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) and the now-expanding\\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), the\\nnations of Central America too are forming closer ties. It is\\nbecoming more and more apparent that this is the path of\\nprogress. The worldwide trend towards closer multilateral\\ncooperation is increasing, and will lead to progress, security\\nand prosperity; it is the path of the future. One the one\\nhand, the Information Age with undreamed-of possibilities,\\nand, on the other, exclusive communities and citizens\\nwithout rights — this does not add up.\\nYes, globalization is a great leveller. Basically, it\\nconfronts industrial and developing countries alike with the\\nsame question: are we going to accept the challenge of\\nbeing part of a “single world market”, or are we going to\\nmark time? A good number of newly industrialized and\\ndeveloping countries have chosen the way forward, and it\\nhas proved to be the right one. They have received the bulk\\nof global direct investment, which in 1996 increased by 8\\nper cent to almost $350 billion. Nor have the others been\\nforgotten. Within the framework of the G-8 process, the\\nnew global partnership for development was established on\\ntheir behalf. A beginning was made at the Denver summit\\nin June, focusing particularly on the sub-Saharan nations\\nof Africa.\\nSince 1978 Germany has cancelled debts incurred by\\nthe least developed countries and other land-locked\\ndeveloping countries in Africa amounting to more than 9\\nbillion marks. These countries will continue to be the\\nfocal point of our development cooperation. Between\\n1991 and 1995 Germany made available 16.3 billion\\nmarks for Africa’s sub-Saharan nations, and we are proud\\nof that.\\nI am glad that the Security Council is holding a\\nspecial meeting tomorrow on the situation in Africa.\\nMany positive developments have taken place there in\\nrecent years, a fact that is often overlooked.\\nBut light and shadow are still very close together. I\\nneed only mention Congo Brazzaville, Sierra Leone,\\nSomalia and especially the Great Lakes region. My\\ncountry, the Federal Republic of Germany, has played a\\nhumanitarian and political role in all these conflicts, and\\nwe recognize that the African States themselves — in the\\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and in the\\nsubregional organizations — are making significant\\nefforts to settle these conflicts. We must keep on\\nsupporting them.\\nBut Africa’s real problems lie deeper, in the social\\nand economic sphere, and in the lack of cohesion among\\nthe different population groups. In my view, Europe’s\\nvast and important neighbouring continent, which has a\\npopulation of about 800 million covers about 23 per cent\\nof the world’s land surface, has little chance of achieving\\nstability and economic progress unless it follows the path\\nof regional cooperation. Such cooperation brings stability\\nwhere nations are too weak to achieve it individually.\\nSouthern Africa is a good example. At the 1994\\nBerlin conference, cooperation between the SADC and the\\nEuropean Union was raised to a new level. At our\\nmeeting in June we and our African colleagues redefined\\nthe framework for the dialogue between the European\\nUnion and the OAU. Europe will stay on Africa’s side.\\nPart of this support is that we are helping countries\\nlike Angola and Mozambique to rid themselves of the\\nscourge of mines. So far mine clearance by hand has\\nbeen, at least to me, like trying to remove a sand-dune\\nwith a thimble. We cannot accept that. What we need for\\nthis task is safe, large-capacity machinery.\\n13\\n\\n\\nThe Oslo Conference gave rise to a sign of hope.\\nEighty countries have put their names to a comprehensive\\nand verifiable ban on anti-personnel mines. I wish to thank\\nthe Secretary-General for his personal efforts on this issue.\\nAnyone who, like me, has seen the poor, crippled victims\\nin Cambodia, Mozambique or Bosnia knows that these\\ntreacherous killing devices are wholly — I repeat,\\nwholly — immoral. I therefore appeal to all countries still\\non the outside to join the Ottawa process and help us ban\\nthese infernal devices from the face of the Earth.\\nThe world, galvanized by the spirit of freedom, has\\nbeen totally transformed. But this new freedom and its by-\\nproducts constitute a major test for us all, not only as\\nregards competitiveness but also as regards our solidarity,\\nour ability to show tolerance and to work together, and the\\nopening of markets.\\nThe East-West conflict has been consigned to the past.\\nHere too, the question now is: are we going to try and\\nsafeguard the future for posterity, or are we going to allow\\nnew enemy stereotypes to divide us once again? There must\\nbe no clash of civilizations. Hence, the dialogue of\\ncivilizations and world religions must be raised to a new\\nlevel. To me this is the spiritual challenge as we approach\\nthe twenty-first century, for only thus can we bring\\ndifferent standpoints closer together and mobilize the\\nenergies needed for the joint resolution of humanity’s\\ncolossal problems.\\nI suggest that we hold a forum here at the United\\nNations to consider how we can generate new momentum\\nfor this dialogue worldwide. The matter is important\\nenough. Considerable cultural energy and potential for\\ninnovation lie unused, and the United Nations is the proper\\ncatalyst for their development.\\nBut we must be very clear that there cannot and\\nshould not be dialogue with terrorists. Terrorism has again\\nraised its ugly head in Mostar, Jerusalem and Cairo. The\\nvileness of the latest carnage in Algeria would be difficult\\nto exceed: it really does take your breath away. How long\\ncan the international community look away? I know how\\ndifficult it is to help from the outside, but the world\\ncommunity cannot accept the cruel killing of utterly\\ninnocent people in the dark of night without standing up\\nand reacting. We are not powerless in the face of such evil\\nslaughter of mostly uninvolved persons. In Denver, the\\nGroup of Eight called upon all nations to sign the\\ninternational conventions on terrorism. We must resolutely\\ncombat terrorism all over the world, using all democratic\\nmeans at our disposal. I call upon the General Assembly to\\ncomplete by the end of this session the negotiations on a\\nconvention against terrorist bomb attacks, as proposed by\\nthe Group of Eight.\\nExtradition or suitable punishment remains the\\nprinciple underlying our efforts to combat terrorism. No\\none should give refuge to terrorists. We need a united\\nglobal front against terrorism. To combat fanatical killers\\nwe can only consistently apply the law as well as police\\nand judicial measures. The source of sympathy for\\nterrorist objectives must be withered by political means.\\nIn other words, we must get to the roots, which in most\\ncases are social problems.\\nOn my last visit to the Middle East I spoke with\\nmany citizens in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Hebron, and\\nin the refugee camps in Gaza. I sensed their fears and\\nconcerns. Those who have seen the wretched conditions\\nin the camps know that these people must be given a\\nchance to improve their lives. They need to be able to\\nhope again that the peace process is something from\\nwhich they will benefit, that the violence will stop, that\\nthey can find work and have enough to eat, and that their\\nchildren can go to school.\\nFor these hopes to materialize, both sides must show\\na large measure of good will. President Arafat must do\\neverything in his power to stop the terrorism. And the\\nIsraeli Government must desist from any measures which\\ncause the Palestinians to doubt Israel’s commitment to\\npeace. The settlements issue remains the crucial test here;\\nat least, that is what I believe. Continuing to build in Har\\nHoma only makes matters worse, so a moratorium is\\nessential. To my mind, this is the only way to reopen the\\ndoor to peace talks.\\nAs for Iran, the new Government has changed its\\ntone. It remains to be seen whether this will lead to a\\nnew, constructive policy, especially with regard to the\\nMiddle East peace process, human rights and international\\nlaw. Germany has always maintained close and friendly\\nrelations with the Iranian people, and in spite of all that\\nhas happened, in spite of the Mykonos affair, we are\\nready for talks. It is up to the Iranian Government to\\nprovide the basis on which these can take place.\\nWe are pleased that Mrs. Robinson has taken up her\\npost as the new High Commissioner for Human Rights.\\nNowhere is the need for a new culture of dialogue so\\ngreat, we believe, as in the process of protecting such\\nrights. This is crucial to world peace and global\\ndevelopment. Any society that fails to respect human\\n14\\n\\n\\nrights, which include the right of development, is blocking\\nits own progress. Our policy on this matter is based on\\ndialogue and respect for different cultures. But we also\\nagree with Pope John Paul II, who has said that if we want\\npeace we must respect the conscience of the people. No\\ncivilization or religion denies people their rights or\\napproves of murder and torture. Nor can any such action be\\njustified on political grounds.\\nWe need an international criminal court of justice. The\\nstatute of such a court is to be drawn up in Rome next\\nsummer. The court must be empowered to act of its own\\naccord where genocide, crimes against humanity, war\\ncrimes and wars of aggression are concerned, and to do so\\nwherever national courts either do not exist or cannot or are\\nunwilling to prosecute such crimes. The terrible genocides\\nin Rwanda and Srbrenica are warning signs. Such cardinal\\ncrimes should not go unpunished.\\nOur responsibility towards future generations is\\nparticularly acute where protection of the natural sources of\\nlife is concerned. That is why it is crucial to maintain the\\nspirit engendered by the United Nations Conference on\\nEnvironment and Development, the Rio Summit. That is the\\npurpose of the environment initiative put forward by\\nChancellor Kohl together with Brazil, South Africa and\\nSingapore.\\nThe climate conference to be held in Kyoto in\\nDecember will be a major test of the industrial world’s\\ncommitment to the environment. Germany intends to reduce\\nits greenhouse-gas emissions by 25 per cent by the year\\n2010, based on 1990 levels. We and our partners in the\\nEuropean Union are asking the other industrial countries to\\ncut theirs by at least 15 per cent. That would go part of the\\nway towards meeting our responsibility towards posterity.\\nWhen we look at the air pollution in southern Asia,\\nwe cannot fail to admit that we urgently need to agree on\\na forest convention. We must put an end to the ruthless\\nburning of forests to clear vast areas of land. Those who\\ndeplete and destroy their own natural resources will make\\nus all lose out in the end. The eleventh hour is approaching.\\nTwo weeks from now the decision on where to locate\\nthe secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification\\nwill be taken in Rome. We ask members to vote for Bonn.\\nSince the secretariat of the Framework Convention on\\nClimate Change already has its headquarters there, it makes\\nsense to combine the two.\\nThe General Assembly is at a crossroads. Either we\\nsolve our reform problems now and come out of our\\nintrospective shell, or the United Nations will lose\\npolitical standing — that is what would happen. All\\nregional organizations, industrial, developing and\\nnon-aligned countries have a joint responsibility for\\nimplementing the reforms we have been talking about for\\nso long. This applies to all areas of United Nations\\nactivity: economic and social, Security Council and\\nfinance.\\nThe Secretary-General has submitted a bold package\\nof reforms. Even though we do not agree with every\\ndetail, we support the package as a whole. I appeal to all\\nMember States: let us not talk it to shreds, but make\\nquick decisions so that the necessary measures can be put\\ninto effect. The United Nations has to be streamlined in\\norder to increase its efficiency. Whatever savings are\\nmade through reform should be used for developments-\\nassistance purposes.\\nThe Security Council must reflect today’s political\\nrealities, one of which is the greater status of Africa,\\nAsia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The debate on\\nthis matter should not be artificially prolonged. This the\\nmost important body of the United Nations, and it cannot\\ncredibly and effectively perform its role as the guardian\\nof peace in the twenty-first century if its composition\\nremains basically as it was in 1945.\\nIt is gratifying to note that a large number of States\\nregard the reunited Germany as a suitable candidate for a\\npermanent seat on the Security Council. If elected, we\\nwill be able to make a good contribution, one that is in\\nkeeping with the spirit of the Charter.\\nTwo years ago, on the Organization’s fiftieth\\nbirthday, we solemnly pledged to hand on to the next\\nmillennium a United Nations equipped and funded for its\\ntask. That promise has to be kept, and it has to be kept by\\nall. This means, first and foremost, paying our\\ncontributions in full and on time, because without\\nfinances this Organization is a powerless one. The\\nEuropean Union has submitted its proposal for changing\\nthe scale of assessments, the purpose of which is to\\nensure a fair distribution of burdens.\\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights reads,\\n“All human beings are born free and\\nequal in dignity and rights. They are endowed\\n15\\n\\n\\nwith reason and conscience and should act\\ntowards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”\\nThis vision must be sustained: the vision of a world in\\nwhich it is not the law of the strongest, but the strength of\\nthe law which prevails; a world in which both the strong\\nand the weak feel at home; a world fit to live in which we\\ncan safely leave to our children and to our grandchildren.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffFirst of all, I should like to extend my warmest\\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\\n8\\n\\n\\nsession. As an architect of stability, you have played a\\nsubstantial role in securing the recent conclusion of a\\nnumber of major agreements with Ukraine’s neighbouring\\ncountries. I am certain that both that experience and the\\nexperience you have acquired in the field of international\\nrelations and at the United Nations will be decisive factors\\nin leading this session to a successful outcome. I should\\nlike to assure you, Sir, of our full support.\\nI should also like to thank your predecessor,\\nAmbassador Razali, for the skill and commitment with\\nwhich he led our work at the last session of the General\\nAssembly. I also wish to express my appreciation to our\\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the splendid work\\nhe has performed since taking office and, in particular, for\\nhis wide-ranging proposals for the reform of the United\\nNations, which he presented last 16 July.\\nIt is an honour for me to address this Assembly today\\non behalf of the European Union, which, like the United\\nNations, is seeking to change and renew itself in order to\\nface more effectively the challenges of the new millennium.\\nGlobalization, with its emphasis on growing\\ninterdependence between nations and their economies, is\\nbringing profound changes in international relations. A\\nparticular feature of this globalization is the genuine\\nrevolution in the field of information and communications\\ntechnologies, which banishes any notion of geographical\\ndistance. Globalization, characterized by the acceleration of\\ntrade and financial flows and by increased market\\nintegration, is a source for both progress and fresh\\nopportunities. However, it also raises some serious\\nquestions, even among the industrialized countries, which\\nare experiencing a worrying rise in unemployment. We note\\nat the same time that these developments are passing by\\nmany developing countries, which remain in great poverty.\\nMore than 1.5 billion people still live in absolute poverty.\\nWe cannot remain indifferent to this situation.\\nWe are particularly concerned by the growing\\ninequality both within countries and between countries of\\nthe North and of the South, which is a dangerous source of\\nfurther conflict and tension.\\nFree of the threat of confrontation in a polarized\\nworld, we are faced today with a series of global problems\\nboth old and new: underdevelopment, population growth,\\nincreasingly large-scale migration, damage to the\\nenvironment, the proliferation of weapons of all kinds,\\nterrorism, ethnic conflict, drug trafficking, violence — the\\nblind, hateful violence against innocent people that we\\nwitness nearly every day, for example in Algeria — and\\ncrime, often in forms never before encountered.\\nIn order to deal successfully with all these problems,\\nit is essential that we continue to promote justice and\\nsolidarity between all countries and individuals as well as\\ntolerance — I lay particular stress on “tolerance” — and\\nrespect for others and, above all, to strengthen\\ncooperation between States on both the regional and the\\nworld levels.\\nProgressive integration that respects national identity\\nis a hallmark of the policy of the States members of the\\nEuropean Union. In scarcely more than 50 years, we have\\nsucceeded in developing in Europe a stability and a\\nprosperity that the continent has never before experienced.\\nThe European Union is based on democracy as its\\npolitical system and on a social market economy as its\\neconomic system. Our market economy is not a free-for-\\nall; it is mitigated by considerations of social welfare.\\nStates retain full responsibility in the fields of health,\\neducation and social justice. Although this system requires\\nconstant adjustment, its principles are sacrosanct.\\nThe European Union, wishing to respond to the\\nchallenges of the post-cold-war world, proposes to take\\nup three major challenges over the years ahead: the\\nestablishment of an economic and monetary union; the\\nstrengthening of its institutional base through the\\nimplementation of the Amsterdam Treaty; and preparation\\nfor further enlargement towards the eastern and southern\\nEurope.\\nEconomic and monetary union is probably the most\\nimportant and most ambitious economic and political\\nproject to be implemented by Europe since the beginning\\nof the integration process. The Euro, as the single\\ncurrency is to be known, will come into existence on 1\\nJanuary 1999. Its introduction is the culmination of the\\nlengthy process of implementation of the single market.\\nThe Euro is the logical consequence of the venture\\nembarked upon with the European Community’s\\nfoundation in 1957.\\nIn order to prepare for the single currency, the States\\nmembers of the European Union have successfully\\ncommitted themselves to strengthening the coordination\\nof their economic policies and the pursuit of healthier,\\nmore stable macroeconomic and budgetary policies.\\nThe creation of the Euro will help to achieve greater\\nstability and a more balanced international monetary\\n9\\n\\n\\nsystem. It will help to reduce monetary uncertainty and will\\ngive a boost to the development of trade, investment and,\\nhence, growth and employment both at the European and\\nthe world levels.\\nThe Heads of State or Government of the European\\nUnion reached political agreement on 17 June this year on\\na new treaty for Europe, the Amsterdam Treaty. This\\nTreaty will be submitted for signature by plenipotentiaries\\nin two weeks’ time. The Amsterdam Treaty marks a further\\nstep in the building of Europe and opens the way for the\\nlaunching of the enlargement process. It provides for\\ngreater consistency in the external action of the Union, and\\nwill enable it to anticipate crises more effectively and to\\nprovide a more efficient protection of its economic\\ninterests. It emphasizes the defence and security dimension\\nof the European Union, and clarifies in particular the\\nUnion’s role in respect of peacekeeping or peacemaking\\nmissions and humanitarian action.\\nThe new Treaty also provides for the creation of an\\narea of freedom, security and justice, which will enable the\\nUnion to take more effective and coordinated action to\\ncombat terrorism, major crime and illegal immigration.\\nFinally, a number of provisions underline the importance\\nthat the Union attaches to the promotion and to the\\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\nThis coming December, the Union will take major\\ndecisions on future enlargement. Negotiations on accession\\nshould begin as early as possible next year. The\\ninternational repercussions of the enlargement of the Union\\nwill far transcend the new frontiers of an enlarged Europe;\\nthis enlargement will add to Europe’s influence in the\\nworld, will provide the European Union with new\\nneighbours and will make Europe a peaceful, more united\\nand more stable area.\\nIn taking up these three challenges, the European\\nUnion member States seek to unite further in order to form\\na common front against the problem of unemployment and\\nto take more effective action to combat organized crime,\\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of every kind, to\\nact more effectively to prevent major environmental\\ndamage and to ensure lasting growth while making the best\\npossible use of the world’s resources.\\nAt the same time, the European Union is seeking to\\nincrease its influence over world affairs, promote values\\nsuch as peace and security, democracy and human rights in\\na more effective manner, defend its conception of the social\\nmodel and assert its presence on international markets.\\nIt is in that spirit, and in order to strengthen\\ncooperation in the political, economic and financial fields,\\nthat the European Union is developing relations of\\npartnership with all the countries of the world.\\nA larger and more united European Union will also\\nmake a greater contribution towards development\\ncooperation with the most disadvantaged countries. The\\ndevelopment assistance of the European Union is part of\\na policy designed to roll back poverty and inequality in\\nthe world and to foster a sustainable development.\\nThe Union is already the largest contributor to the\\nregular budget of the United Nations and to the budget\\nfor United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is also the\\nlargest international aid donor. The European Community\\nand its member States provide over half the humanitarian\\naid dispensed worldwide and fund 50 per cent of\\ninternational development aid. We provide 40 per cent of\\nassistance for the reconstruction process in Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina, nearly 60 per cent of international aid to\\nRussia and to the republics of the former Soviet Union,\\nhalf of the aid for the Palestinian territories and one third\\nof the total aid for the Middle East.\\nAs in the past, the European Union describes its\\nrelations with third countries, together with its positions\\non and action in respect of areas of conflict throughout\\nthe world, in a memorandum that is circulated as an\\nintegral part of this address. I should like, however, to\\nhighlight a number of issues which continue to hold our\\nfull attention.\\nThe European Union continues to make a major\\ncontribution towards the consolidation of peace in all the\\ncountries of the former Yugoslavia. It wishes to develop\\nits relations and to strengthen its cooperation with those\\ncountries to the extent that their respective Governments\\npursue a policy which respects the peace agreements\\nconcluded and which enables them to progress towards\\ndemocracy, the rule of law, tolerance and respect for\\nhuman rights and minorities.\\nThe European Union is concerned at the tardiness in\\nimplementing the peace agreements in Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina. It emphasizes that the responsibility for\\nsuch implementation rests with the parties themselves.\\nWe fully support the efforts of the High\\nRepresentative, Mr. Carlos Westendorp. We pay a tribute\\nto his deputy, Ambassador Gerd Wagner, to Mr. David\\n10\\n\\n\\nKrishkovich and to their colleagues who have given their\\nlives in their commitment to peace.\\nThe European Union is determined to insist on the\\nstrict and full application of the peace agreements in Bosnia\\nand Herzegovina and of the conclusions of the Sintra\\nministerial meeting. It is on the basis of such application\\nthat the European Union is willing to continue to contribute\\nto the international reconstruction effort. It continues to\\nattach great importance to the return of refugees and\\ndisplaced persons and to demand the full cooperation of all\\nparties with the International Criminal Tribunal as a\\nnecessary condition for a lasting reconciliation and a just\\npeace.\\nWithout minimizing the difficulties in the Muslim\\nCroat Federation, the European Union observes with\\nconcern the political crisis which has erupted in the\\nRepublika Srpska. It calls on all parties to respect the\\nconstitutional functioning of that entity and to take vigorous\\naction to reform the police and to establish freedom of the\\npress. We believe the holding of legislative elections under\\nthe supervision of the Organization for Security and\\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) constitutes the appropriate\\nand democratic means for resolving the present political\\ndeadlock.\\nThe European Union welcomes the recent holding of\\nmunicipal elections, on 13 and 14 September, with the\\nparticipation of all the parties. These elections mark an\\nimportant step in the process of democratization in Bosnia\\nand Herzegovina. We appeal to the parties to respect the\\nresults as certified by the OSCE.\\nThe European Union also remains concerned by the\\nsituation in Kosovo, in particular by the lack of respect for\\nhuman rights and the principles of the rule of law.\\nConcerning Cyprus, the European Union regrets that\\nthe intercommunal talks under the aegis of the United\\nNations have failed to register progress. We call on the\\nleaders of both communities to resume the talks, as\\nproposed by Mr. Cordovez. We urge them and all parties\\nconcerned to work constructively and in good faith to\\npromote the success of these talks. We reject any link\\nbetween the talks and the membership negotiations with\\nCyprus. The latter will be initiated in accordance with the\\ndecisions taken by the European Council and will contribute\\npositively towards the search for a political solution. The\\nEuropean Union recalled that Cypriot membership should\\nbenefit both communities and should help to bring about\\ncivil peace and reconciliation.\\nIn the Middle East, the peace process is at a\\nworrisome standstill. The European Union calls on the\\npeoples and Governments of the region to renew the spirit\\nof mutual confidence which, at Madrid in 1991 and in\\nOslo in 1993, gave rise to the hope of a just, lasting and\\ncomprehensive peace. We call upon the Israeli and\\nPalestinian leaders to continue the negotiations to further\\nthe implementation of the Interim Agreement and the\\nHebron agreement, and to resume talks on permanent\\nstatus. We ask them once more to abstain from any\\nunilateral action which may prejudice the issues relating\\nto permanent status.\\nThe European Union firmly condemns the recent\\nterrorist attacks in Jerusalem. We call on each side to\\nshow absolute determination in combating terrorism. We\\nhope that cooperation in the field of security between\\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority will be re-established\\nand reinforced. To that end, we propose the setting up of\\na permanent security committee with the participation of\\nthe parties involved and, possibly, with that of the United\\nStates and the European Union.\\nWe urge both parties not to yield to blackmail by\\nextremists bent on sabotaging the peace process. We ask\\nthat Israel discontinue certain measures taken with regard\\nto the Palestinians which we consider to be counter-\\nproductive. In particular, we ask that Israel transfer all of\\nthe tax revenue owed to the Palestinian Authority. It is\\nnot in the interests of peace to weaken the Palestinian\\neconomy, administration and leadership and to feed the\\nfeelings of frustration and humiliation of an entire people.\\nIn the opinion of the European Union, peace remains the\\nonly strategic choice and the only lasting guarantee for\\nthe security and prosperity of both sides.\\nThe European Union will continue, through the\\nefforts of its Special Envoy for the Middle East Peace\\nProcess, Ambassador Moratinos, as well as through its\\ndiplomatic relations, its economic commitment and its\\nrelations of friendship and trust with the various parties,\\nto work with the parties concerned both within and\\noutside the region, and especially with the United States,\\nto relaunch the peace process.\\nIn Africa, major developments have occurred in\\nrecent months, notably in the Great Lakes region, which\\ncontinues to experience serious problems. The European\\nUnion fully supports the efforts undertaken there, as\\nelsewhere, by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\\nin close cooperation with the United Nations. It welcomes\\nthe action taken by both its special representative,\\n11\\n\\n\\nMr. Ajello, and the Special Representative of the\\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the OAU,\\nMr. Sahnoun. The international community must thus aim\\nat establishing peace, at consolidating the process of\\nnational reconciliation in the countries concerned, at\\ncreating a climate conducive to the voluntary return of\\nrefugees and of facilitating the establishment of normal\\ndemocratic life. We support the introduction of the rule of\\nlaw, which should put an end to the climate of impunity\\nprevailing in the region and encourage its economic and\\nsocial recovery.\\nThe accession of the new authorities in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo signals a very important change for\\nthe Congo and the whole of Africa. The European Union is\\naware of the scale of requirements for reconstruction in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and is willing to\\ncontribute its support for reconstruction. It confirms its\\nreadiness to resume cooperation with that Government on\\na gradual basis. The resumption of cooperation will depend,\\naccording to the conclusions of the European Council of\\nAmsterdam, on the progress observed in the fields of\\nhuman rights, democratization and the establishment of the\\nrule of law.\\nThe European Union emphasizes the need for the\\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\\ncooperate fully with the Office of the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Refugees in order to ensure the safe\\nreturn of refugees, particularly to Rwanda. We also urge the\\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\\ncooperate fully with the United Nations in order that the\\nmission investigating the allegations of massacres and other\\nhuman rights violations can take place without impediment\\nor delay.\\nThe European Union remains seriously worried by the\\nsituation in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) and is\\nconcerned that the parties to the conflict have so far failed\\nto overcome their differences. We urge all the parties\\ninvolved to cease hostilities and to work together to achieve\\nnational reconciliation and restore a peaceful society. We\\nreiterate the Union’s full support for the mediation efforts\\nundertaken by President Bongo of Gabon.\\nThe European Union condemns all violence in\\nBurundi. It encourages the authorities of that country to\\naccelerate the dismantling of the reassembly camps. We\\nearnestly appeal to all parties in Burundi to embark\\ndefinitively on the road towards negotiation and national\\nreconciliation.\\nThe European Union is also concerned by the\\nworsening insecurity in Rwanda’s north-western\\nprovinces, which affects all populations, without\\nexception.\\nThe European Union welcomes the success of the\\nmonitoring mission in the Central African Republic,\\nestablished under the Bangui Agreements.\\nThe European Union also continues to be concerned\\nby the situation in Cambodia, which is likely to\\njeopardize the whole democratization process and the\\nmajor efforts by the international community in support\\nof that country’s reconstruction. We renew our support\\nfor the mediation efforts by the Association of South-East\\nAsian Nations and welcome the constructive constitutional\\nrole played by His Majesty King Sihanouk in the search\\nfor a solution to this crisis.\\nWe appeal for an immediate end to all violence in\\nCambodia and reiterate the importance we attach to the\\nholding of free pluralist elections in 1998.\\nI would like now to take up several thematic\\nquestions.\\nThe tragic consequences of the indiscriminate spread\\nand use of anti-personnel landmines have aroused genuine\\nemotion in world public opinion in recent years. In\\nOctober 1996 the Union, for its part, adopted a decision\\non joint action on anti-personnel landmines in which it\\nexpresses its determination to achieve the aim of totally\\neliminating such mines and of actively working towards\\nthe earliest possible conclusion of an effective\\ninternational agreement on a worldwide ban on these\\nweapons.\\nWe welcome the work done at the recent Oslo\\nDiplomatic Conference, which resulted in the adoption of\\nan international Convention. We shall also be pursuing\\nthe achievement of our aims at the Conference on\\nDisarmament.\\nNext 10 December will see the start of celebrations\\non the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. That Declaration,\\nadopted on 10 December 1948, and the two international\\npacts and other legal instruments on the subject that were\\nsubsequently adopted, are still fully relevant today. We\\nreaffirm our deep commitment to the universality of\\nhuman rights and to their protection and promotion. The\\nyear 1988 will provide an opportunity for all members of\\n12\\n\\n\\nthe international community to step up their actions to\\nensure better implementation of the universal principles of\\nthe Declaration through the instruments and machinery of\\nthe United Nations.\\nThe year 1998 will also be an opportunity to review\\nthe implementation of the Declaration and Programme of\\nAction adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights\\nheld in Vienna in 1993.\\nWe welcome the appointment of Mrs Mary Robinson\\nas United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\\nShe will have our full support. We wish to underline the\\nimportance of her mission, not least in the context of the\\nfiftieth anniversary.\\nRegarding the environment and development, the\\nGeneral Assembly will be asked to endorse at this session\\nthe results of the special session on the follow-up to\\nAgenda 21 and of the Rio Conference. The European Union\\nconsiders it essential that the implementation of Agenda 21\\nreceive fresh political impetus. We believe it is imperative\\nthat we come to a substantial conclusion of the negotiations\\non climate change to be held in Kyoto in December. We\\nurge all States to work towards that end.\\nWe have proposed clear objectives for the reduction of\\ngreenhouse-gas emissions, and we hope that other States\\nwill very soon be making their own detailed proposals in\\norder to speed up the progress that is vitally needed if the\\nKyoto session of the Conference is to be a success.\\nTwo years ago the Heads of State and Government\\nmeeting in this Hall on the occasion of the fiftieth\\nanniversary of the United Nations observed that, in a\\nrapidly changing world, the objectives set out in the Charter\\nhad lost none of their relevance.\\nIn many regions of the planet, we still have to face up\\nto serious threats to international peace and security. More\\nthan ever, we need to promote economic and social\\ndevelopment. It is vital that the ideals upon which our\\nOrganization is founded — human rights, good governance\\nand democracy — come to be reflected more and more in\\nthe behaviour of public authorities and in people’s everyday\\nlives. The primacy of the rule of law must be reaffirmed.\\nWe realize that if our Organization is to respond\\nadequately to the profound changes in its external\\nenvironment it must adapt its structures to the new realities\\nof the modern world.\\nLast July we heard the Secretary-General’s ambitious\\nproposals, and we welcomed them. It is not, of course, a\\nquestion of rewriting the mandates of the United Nations,\\nto which we remain deeply committed, but of\\ntransforming the Organization into a productive and\\nefficient instrument at the service of all the peoples of the\\nworld.\\nIn examining these proposals, at its fifty-second\\nsession, the General Assembly is embarking on a period\\nof debate and decision-making that promises to be one of\\nthe most significant in the history of the United Nations.\\nWe need an Organization that fulfils its mandate to\\npreserve peace and international security more rapidly and\\neffectively by building better capacities for action in the\\nfields of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and\\npeacemaking, and by having more effective capacities for\\naction in the areas of recovery and reconstruction after a\\nconflict.\\nWe need an Organization that responds better to one\\nof its fundamental objectives, which consists of promoting\\neconomic and social progress, eradicating poverty and\\nensuring the widest possible participation in an expanding\\nworld economy.\\nWe need United Nations funds and programmes that\\ncan translate the objectives of the Organization in the\\nfield of sustainable development. They must offer the\\ncountries and the peoples of the world both material\\nsupport and a frame of reference that will enable them to\\ngenerate their own development in the most efficient\\nmanner and in a way suited to their specific needs.\\nWe need a United Nations system that provides a\\ncredible response to the complex problems of\\nhumanitarian assistance and emergency situations,\\nproblems which include conflict prevention, peacekeeping,\\nrehabilitation and transition towards development.\\nFinally, we need an Organization that integrates in\\nall its activities the fundamental concept of respect for\\nhuman rights, which is an integral part of the quest for\\npeace and security, economic prosperity and social justice.\\nTo attain those objectives, our Organization must be\\nable to rely not only on the commitment of the Secretary-\\nGeneral and the cooperation of Member States, but on the\\nsupport of every sector of international society, and in\\nparticular on the non-governmental organizations, whose\\nefforts inspire and complement our own.\\n13\\n\\n\\nThe programme of reforms put forward by the\\nSecretary-General has two parts. The first concerns the\\nresponsibility of the Secretary-General himself. It\\nsupplements the series of proposals he put forward in\\nMarch this year. It is designed to rationalize the operations\\nof Secretariat services and United Nations agencies and to\\nimprove their coordination. The proposals are intended to\\nmould those services into a more coherent structure. There\\nis a need to establish a community of ideas, a coherence of\\neffort and greater flexibility in implementing action. We\\nurge the Secretary-General to implement those proposals as\\nquickly as possible. The European Union considers that\\nmodalities could be worked out to see that the savings\\nrealized are reinvested in the field of development.\\nThe second part of the programme deals with\\nimproving the operation of the United Nations system and\\nstrengthening its intergovernmental machinery. It requires\\nthe approval of Member States. Here, too, the European\\nUnion believes that the method used and the choices made\\nby the Secretary-General should open the way to effective\\nand far-reaching reform of the United Nations. This applies\\nparticularly to the promotion of economic and social\\ndevelopment, which must remain one of the priority\\nobjectives of our Organization.\\nIn this sector, the reform should improve the\\nOrganization’s capacity for action at the intergovernmental\\nas well as the structural and managerial levels. In the view\\nof the European Union, the reform of the United Nations,\\nas an instrument in the service of development, cannot be\\nconceived as a cost-cutting exercise; on the contrary, it\\nmust be designed to strengthen and revitalize the\\nOrganization so that it can respond to the challenges of the\\nfuture in the most effective way possible. Only a reformed\\nand revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for\\na global partnership between developing countries,\\ndeveloped countries and multilateral organizations, with the\\nprime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable\\ndevelopment.\\nThe European Union believes that, taken as a whole,\\nthe programme of reforms proposed by the Secretary-\\nGeneral represents a balanced package. It attempts to take\\ninto account the various interests in play and, once\\nimplemented, will enable the Organization to fulfil its\\nmandate more adequately and to carry out its tasks in the\\nservice of the international community more effectively.\\nWe therefore consider that, if we want to achieve the\\nrenewal of the United Nations, it is of overriding\\nimportance that the Secretary-General’s proposals be\\nexamined by the General Assembly in an integrated\\nmanner and as a package. It is also important to abide, so\\nfar as possible, by the timetable that the Secretary-\\nGeneral has suggested, so that the reform measures can\\nstart to be implemented at the beginning of 1998.\\nThe reform programme before us affords us a unique\\nopportunity to reform the Organization from top to\\nbottom. It is for us, the Member States, to demonstrate\\nthe necessary ambition, courage and clarity of vision to\\nshow that we are equal to this challenge.\\nThe European Union is well aware that the proposals\\nbefore us necessarily represent a compromise between the\\nsometimes divergent interests of Member States, and that\\nthey cannot, therefore, fully reflect either its own views\\nor those of other schools of thought within the General\\nAssembly.\\nBecause we believe that the programme of reforms,\\ntaken as a whole, represents significant progress for our\\nOrganization, the Union does not intend to press for the\\nfine points of its own positions to be taken into account\\nwith regard to each of the proposals or recommendations\\nbefore us. It is our hope that other delegations will\\napproach this exercise in a similar spirit and that they can\\nagree to put the general positive thrust of the package of\\nproposals before the satisfaction of their individual\\ndemands.\\nOver the coming weeks the European Union intends\\nto play an active part in the Assembly’s work. Our task\\nis to reach general agreement on a feasible, constructive\\nand coherent response to the Secretary-General’s\\nproposals, one that respects his responsibilities and his\\nauthority.\\nNecessary as it is, the reform exercise on which we\\nhave embarked will not bear fruit until the United Nations\\nhas the financial resources it needs to fulfil its mandates.\\nFor several years now, the United Nations has been\\nembroiled in a financial crisis, which began as a cash-\\nflow problem, but which has now become structural. That\\ncrisis is undermining the necessary sense of partnership\\nbetween Member States and compromising\\nimplementation of the Organization’s programmes in\\nmany areas. The European Union has often stated that the\\ncrisis cannot be resolved until all Member States have\\nagreed to meet their obligations under the United Nations\\nCharter in full by settling their arrears and by paying on\\ntime and without conditions the full amount of their\\n14\\n\\n\\nmandatory contributions to the Organization’s regular\\nbudget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations.\\nThe States members of the European Union, whose\\ncontributions represent 35 per cent of the regular budget\\nand 38 per cent of the peacekeeping budget, have always\\nhonoured their financial obligations promptly, fully and\\nunconditionally.\\nThe European Union has put forward a package of\\ncoherent proposals designed to put the Organization on a\\nsound and predictable financial footing. They relate to\\nmeasures to speed up the payment of arrears, to tighten up\\nthe system for paying contributions, to monitor United\\nNations spending more closely and to reform the scale of\\nassessment so as to better reflect the principle of ability to\\npay.\\nIt is important that together, at this fifty-second\\nsession of the General Assembly, we find a constructive\\nand viable solution to these questions, which are\\nfundamental if we wish to ensure that our Organization has\\nthe capacity to fulfil its mandate at the dawn of the twenty-\\nfirst century.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\ufeffMay I first say, Sir, how pleased my country is at your\\nelection as President of the fifty-second session of the\\nUnited Nations General Assembly. I should also like to say\\nto the Secretary-General that France welcomes the action he\\nhas already taken and assure him that he has our support\\nand confidence.\\nI shall begin my statement by expressing a conviction\\non behalf of my country: the world needs the United\\nNations more than ever. No, the United Nations did not\\nlose its raison d'être with the end of the cold war, the end\\nof the arms race between the two blocs and the head-on\\nclash of differing ideologies.\\nOn the contrary, the need for a universal regulating\\nbody has never been so apparent. The reasons are known to\\nall. Without regret, we left the era of bipolar confrontation\\nto enter, in 1991, a new, global, evolving world in which\\n185 States cooperate, make alliances with one another or\\ncompete in stable or, conversely, unstable combinations.\\nIn this world, States are no longer the sole players. The\\ngiant conglomerates, the financial markets, the media,\\nopinion groups and non-governmental organizations all\\nplay an increasing role. Because of this, there is an\\noverriding need for clear, fair and predictable ground\\nrules to establish a framework for settling conflicts or\\nmere differences. For, nowadays, no serious problem can\\nbe resolved by one country, even the most powerful,\\nentirely on its own.\\nUnless we take care, unless we manage to build a\\nworld in which the rule of law prevails among all States,\\na world in equilibrium between its major centres of\\npower, other scenarios will ensue: the absence of a\\ncounterweight will encourage the predominance of a\\nsingle Power, and, inevitably, that Power will be tempted\\nto engage in unilateralism; for want of organized regional\\nentities, globalization will exacerbate the economic — and\\nsometimes political — struggle of each against all; States\\nwill find themselves further weakened, and some will\\nimplode under the effects of aggressive nationalism,\\nwhich is often contagious. Fierce competition will render\\nvirtually impossible environmental conservation, however\\nurgent, however vital in the true meaning of the word, as\\nwell as the fight against drugs and crime; greater respect\\nfor human rights will be compromised.\\nOur common task must be to forestall such dangers\\nand, at the same time, to consolidate, together, the\\nachievements of recent years. For this, regional groupings\\nare one of the best possible foundations. Europe, which\\nhas been the crucible of so many wars, has been showing\\nthe way for half a century. The growth rates achieved by\\nmany countries in Asia, in Latin America and now in\\nAfrica, announce the emergence of new centres of power\\nand prosperity. Political and economic entities are being\\norganized and institutionalized: South-East Asia meets in\\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN);\\nin Latin America, the Southern Cone Common Market\\n(MERCOSUR) is developing, as are the Southern African\\nDevelopment Community (SADC) in southern Africa and\\nthe Economic Community of West African States\\n19\\n\\n\\n(ECOWAS) in the west of that continent. To some extent,\\none might also include cultural and political entities, such\\nas the Commonwealth and la Francophonie. This is a\\nsensible way to adapt to globalization.\\nHowever, at the global level we need a coherent,\\neffective United Nations with the resources necessary to\\ncarry out its missions. It is the task of this body to facilitate\\nthe smooth organization of international relations and to\\ndetermine universally recognized rules of law. To be sure,\\nother organizations exist in various sectors, and these have\\ntheir own, very important areas of authority. But none of\\nthem can take the place of the United Nations in giving the\\nworld of tomorrow a set of comprehensive rules. True to its\\ntradition, France will support all the Organization's efforts\\nto that end.\\nI come now to the main object of the session which is\\nbeginning. To carry out the major role we expect of it, the\\nUnited Nations must retain or reacquire the means to take\\ndecisions and to act. For this, we must resolve two matters:\\nUnited Nations reform and the financing of the\\nOrganization. The ability of the United Nations to act in the\\nyears ahead will depend on the solutions we find together.\\nFrance approved of the move by the new Secretary-\\nGeneral at the outset of his mandate to continue the study\\ninitiated by his predecessor, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\\nThe main lines Mr. Kofi Annan has proposed for the work\\nand the impetus he has given to the process of revamping\\nthe Organization have received France’s full support, a\\nsupport shared by France’s partners in the European Union.\\nThe remarks made from this rostrum by its current\\nPresident, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg,\\nillustrate this. I should like to comment more specifically\\non three points: the Security Council, financial reform and\\nrestructuring.\\nThe current composition of the Security Council no\\nlonger accurately reflects the political geography of today’s\\nworld. Clearly, it has to be reformed — that is to say,\\nenlarged — to become more representative.\\nIn this connection, we must take into account the\\nSecurity Council’s indispensable role in peacekeeping and\\nthus elect countries able to contribute to this task, whether\\nthey are from the North or the South.\\nAccordingly, my country is in favour of the accession\\nof Germany, Japan and three countries from the South to\\npermanent seats and the establishment of new\\nnon-permanent seats. For a Security Council composed\\nsolely of the principal countries of the North would not\\nbe representative. Nor should we forget that, once it is\\nenlarged, and hence more representative, the Council will\\nstill have to be effective. That is essential.\\nThe proposals that have been submitted to us should\\nmake it possible to move forward. However, we are all\\naware that no consensus has yet been reached and that\\ndebates on this matter will be difficult. National interests\\nand the concerns of regional groups must be given due\\nconsideration. In any event, I welcome President Razali’s\\nperseverance throughout the fifty-first session of the\\nUnited Nations General Assembly, which made it possible\\nto draft a solid working basis from which we must now\\nproceed to work to find a solution.\\nFurthermore, financial reform of the United Nations\\nis a particularly complex issue. It is shocking that the\\nUnited Nations should be in a precarious state and\\ntherefore in a situation of financial and budgetary\\ndependence with respect to its debtors. I believe that we\\nwill be able to move towards a solution on the basis of\\nthree principles: what is owed to the United Nations must\\nbe paid in full, on time and without conditions. Finally,\\nthe payment of contributions should not be a way of\\nexerting pressure on the Secretary-General and the other\\nMember States.\\nWith these rudimentary principles as a basis, France\\nis open to discussion on all aspects of the problem. We\\nwill have to decide on the scale for apportioning\\nassessments among all States. There is no perfect scale,\\nbut some are not as bad as others. The concept of each\\nState’s ability to pay, which has enjoyed consensus since\\nthe outset, still seems simple, logical and fair today. On\\nthat basis, a solution can be found that takes account of\\nthe needs and interests of each State. France will do its\\nutmost to facilitate the settlement of the financial crisis.\\nWe can be both imaginative and conciliatory — like the\\nEuropean Union’s plan. But our efforts will succeed only\\nif there is respect for the rules I have just recalled, which\\nreflect our Organization's impartiality and credibility. If\\nthe United Nations were forced to comply with the\\nunilateral demands of one among us, in regard both to its\\nfinancing and its functioning, then how could it convince\\nanyone in the future that it is impartial and faithful to the\\nprinciple of the equality of all under the Charter, and\\ngenerate respect for its decisions?\\nI come now to restructuring. The Secretary-General\\nhas undertaken to restructure and regroup the\\nOrganization’s institutions. France appreciates the logic of\\n20\\n\\n\\nthis approach. It therefore welcomes the establishment in\\nVienna of a centre to deal specifically with combating new\\ntransnational dangers such as organized crime, drug\\ntrafficking and terrorism, problems that we must fight with\\never-increased vigour. It is also very much in favour of\\nintegrating the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\\nRights and the Centre for Human Rights into a single entity\\nin Geneva where the main humanitarian aid services are\\nalready established. It also hopes that the main issues\\ninvolving disarmament can continue to be addressed in\\nGeneva.\\nFrom this rostrum, I applaud the appointment of\\nMrs. Mary Robinson to the post of High Commissioner for\\nHuman Rights. Her very strong personality is\\ncommensurate with the challenges her task entails. The\\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, starting on 10 December this\\nyear, will provide an opportunity to reaffirm, in the face of\\npersistent violations and ever-recurring acts of barbarism,\\nthe universality of these rights. But we will also have to ask\\nourselves, in addition to making the usual declarations that\\nare still necessary, what political and economic actions are\\nneeded to make real headway, in specific situations,\\ntowards respect for human rights, and how the emergence\\nof democracies can be encouraged from outside.\\nThe United Nations, while adapting, must remain the\\npreferred instrument for taking action in the interests of\\npeace. At this time, the United Nations is really the only\\norganization that can try to bring order to an international\\nsociety which is becoming fragmented and globalized at the\\nsame time. The United Nations is faced with both a\\nresurgence of every kind of micro-nationalism and the\\nstrengthening of regional entities. Most conflicts are now\\nnot between States but within them. Given these new\\nchallenges, the United Nations has already demonstrated\\nhow adaptable and flexible it is. But we must continue. To\\nensure the lasting settlement of conflicts, consciences have\\nto be assuaged and justice needs to be done to put an end\\nto the endless cycle of revenge. The perpetrators of the\\nmost serious crimes must be tried impartially, with respect\\nfor the rights of the defence, and after an exemplary\\ninvestigation which reveals the facts in full. This is why\\nFrance supports the action of the international criminal\\ntribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and hopes\\nthat the forthcoming conference on an international criminal\\ncourt will be a success.\\nSince the beginning of the decade, the Organization’s\\nactions to promote peace and international stability have\\nchanged radically. The time has passed when large-scale\\npeacekeeping operations were mounted solely under the\\nblue flag of the United Nations, in Cambodia and the\\nformer Yugoslavia for example, in order to take on\\nmassive challenges alone. Today, the United Nations\\nintervenes more and more frequently in conjunction with\\nother organizations or by authorizing the action of\\nregional actors. In Europe, the United Nations is pooling\\nits efforts with those of the North Atlantic Treaty\\nOrganization in sensitive theatres of operation, and even\\nwith those of the Organization for Security and\\nCooperation in Europe. In Africa, for the first time, the\\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) have in the past\\nyear appointed a joint special representative in the person\\nof Ambassador Sahnoun, in the Great Lakes region. It is\\ngood that these two organizations are working together.\\nThis development must be encouraged. We must also help\\nAfrican States and organizations to strengthen their own\\npeacekeeping capabilities. To this end, countries outside\\nthe African continent must pool their efforts and not\\nmultiply the number of rival and sometimes redundant\\ninitiatives. For instance, the Government of France, the\\nUnited Kingdom and the United States recently agreed to\\nact together with all those who wish to do so to\\nstrengthen the peacekeeping capabilities of African\\ncountries, under the auspices of the United Nations, of\\ncourse, and in cooperation with the OAU.\\nBut, in France's view, encouraging Africa to become\\nmore involved in resolving crises certainly does not mean\\nthat the international community should relinquish its\\nother responsibilities with regard to the African continent.\\nIt is therefore essential that the United Nations be ready,\\nonce the declared conditions are met, to act in Congo-\\nBrazzaville. By the same token, the many recent tragedies\\nin the Great Lakes region make sustained international\\ninvolvement indispensable. This United Nations\\ncommitment to promote peace and development must also\\nserve to further human rights. That is why it is important\\nfor the humanitarian investigative task force in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to be able to carry out\\nits mission. I might add that by spending too much time\\ntalking about crises in Africa, one might forget the\\nessential point, namely that the African continent is taking\\noff in quite an unprecedented way. My country believes\\nin this.\\nWe are all still mobilized by the situation in the\\nMiddle East. The peace process, set in train on the\\ninitiative of clear-sighted and courageous men on both\\nsides, raised tremendous hopes. We can clearly see the\\nincreasingly tragic consequences to which the current\\n21\\n\\n\\nstalemate would lead, were it to last. The peoples of this\\nregion are once again stuck in an impasse, in a situation of\\nhumiliation, resentment, and the fear of terrorism. New\\nefforts are therefore necessary so that these two peoples,\\nIsraeli and Palestinian, which are matched in terms of\\ninsecurity and fear of the future, can together find justice\\nand security. France gave its full support to the action by\\nthe American Secretary of State, who recently went to the\\nMiddle East. Indeed, the United States has a special\\nresponsibility and special means to attempt to reinvigorate\\nthe peace process and effectively combat the deadly acts of\\nextremism. France and Europe are ready to take part in any\\nconstructive move to this end.\\nWhat can the United Nations do? It cannot take the\\nplace of the parties concerned, which have the primary\\nresponsibility. It is up to the Organization to state, or\\nrestate, the law and to recall the principles which must be\\nthe basis for any peace if we want it to last. I refer here to\\nthe resolutions adopted by the Security Council on the\\nconflict in the Middle East, not forgetting resolution 425\\n(1978), which deals with the integrity of Lebanon in\\nparticular.\\nMany other crisis situations where the wounds have\\nnot healed could be mentioned from this rostrum — so\\ndiverse is the work of the United Nations. In particular, I\\nam thinking of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\\nwhere security has been restored but where the construction\\nof a State with viable democratic institutions remains\\nuncertain; and of Albania, where the new stability, thanks\\nto resolute European action authorized by the United\\nNations, is giving rise to new hopes. I am also thinking of\\nthe tenacious efforts of the United Nations to contain or\\ndefuse the crises in Haiti, Cyprus, Georgia, Afghanistan,\\nTajikistan and elsewhere.\\nFinally, let us not forget, now or ever, much-needed\\ndevelopment assistance.\\nOf course, the insertion of emerging economies,\\nincluding the former underdeveloped economies, into the\\nglobal economy is an excellent thing; indeed, past efforts in\\nthis regard have proved to be well founded. But this must\\nnot be a selfish excuse for the rich countries to give up\\ntheir effort to provide development assistance, which is\\nequally necessary. In any event, this is very much an\\nimperative for the leaders of the member States of the\\nFrancophone community. The summit of these States in\\nHanoi in November will attest to their interest in more\\nbalanced development and also to their commitment to\\nrespecting the multiplicity of cultures and languages.\\nI will say no more, however — other than to draw\\none single conclusion. While the world has changed so\\nmuch over the past 50 years, and even more over the past\\nsix years, its inhabitants still voice the same needs. The\\nrule of law must be continually consolidated and the\\ndemocratic ideal put into practice, faced as we are with\\nthe temptations of oppression and the use of force, for\\nwhich new pretexts are constantly being invoked. How\\ncan we be sure that the factors that make for war and\\nchaos are banned for ever from all continents, including\\nEurope?\\nAt this moment of our Organization's reform, let us\\nnot forget the lessons of history. Only international\\ndialogue, the common management of crises, beginning\\nwith their prevention, and the wise conservation of the\\nearth’s resources make it possible for the voice of reason\\nand peace to prevail and for confidence in progress to be\\nrebuilt. The United Nations is the right and the only\\nlegitimate forum for such international discussions, and\\nthe only one where they are universal. Our Organization\\nis an irreplaceable framework and a vital necessity for us\\nall. In the past, it has often been able to deter, address,\\nresolve and prevent. Let us reform it so as to make it\\neven more useful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffAt the outset, allow me to take this opportunity\\nto congratulate Minister Udovenko, our colleague from\\nUkraine, on his election as President of this session of\\nthe General Assembly and to express my most sincere\\nthanks to Ambassador Razali of Malaysia for the\\ninvaluable work he helped us achieve during the fifty-\\nfirst session of the Assembly.\\nIt is clear that the way in which we organize\\nourselves as a world community is of the utmost\\nimportance for questions of war and peace, poverty and\\nwealth, and justice and injustice in the world.\\nThe United Nations Secretariat and the leadership of\\nour Organization have a key role in this regard. All those\\nserving United Nations institutions deserve our gratitude\\nfor the way in which they carry out their work, both here\\nin New York and in the field, often in precarious\\nsituations in which some have even lost their lives.\\nBut we should ask whether we, the Member States,\\nhave done enough to find common responses. Have we\\ngiven the United Nations the necessary tools for\\ncomprehensive management? Have we not blamed the\\nOrganization for a lack of success in some of its\\nendeavours, when they may have been doomed to failure\\nanyway because there was not enough support from\\nMember States?\\nWe must be fully aware that, as Member States, we\\nsometimes try to impose tasks upon the Organization\\nwhich are beyond its capabilities, while we are all too\\noften slow to provide help and support whenever and\\nwherever it is really needed. More than once we have\\nseen — in Africa, for example — that the United\\nNations has had to spread itself too thinly over vast\\ndistances and that adequate support for a United\\nNations role has not been forthcoming from Member\\nStates, which has weakened the United Nations ability\\nto react when a dynamic response was needed in crisis\\nsituations.\\nHas not the time come, during this session, to\\nensure that the Organization can act with renewed\\nvigour and reconfirm its authority? I am convinced that\\nthe answer to this question should be positive, and that\\nwe should, like the President of the European Union\\nand other previous speakers, throw our full weight\\nbehind the Secretary-General's proposals to prepare the\\nOrganization more effectively for the coming\\nmillennium.\\nMore efficiency and coordination, greater cohesion\\nand better cooperation between Headquarters and\\nagencies in the field are minimal changes, but fully\\njustified. However, we need to do more because this\\nyear we must resolve the United Nations financial\\ncrisis.\\nIt is unacceptable that Member States should not\\npay their dues in full and that they attach conditions to\\nthe payment of what they owe. All the speakers in the\\ngeneral debate should be able to proclaim from this\\nrostrum not just that they want to improve the\\nOrganization's efficiency and that they support the\\nSecretary-General in his efforts to that end, but also\\nthat their contributions have been paid in full,\\nunconditionally, thus proving their commitment to the\\ngoals of the United Nations and our common agenda.\\nThere can be no doubt that this agenda includes\\nthe achievements of the 12 United Nations conferences\\nwhich, from the 1990 World Summit for Children to\\nthe 1996 World Food Summit, have paved the way for\\nthe current agenda in the area of international\\ndevelopment. But responsibilities have often been\\ndistributed injudiciously and too widely, while mandates\\nhave proved insufficient. A more integrated approach in\\nthe social and economic sector has in any case become\\nnecessary. I therefore welcome the fact that the\\nSecretary-General’s proposals for reform pay particular\\n29\\n\\n\\nattention to development, and I subscribe fully to his\\nproposals.\\nFurthermore, a well-balanced expansion of the\\nSecurity Council should be achieved without delay.\\nBelgium, together with a number of like-minded\\ncountries that share the general concern with regard to\\nstrengthening the authority of the Security Council, has\\nclearly stated its views here in New York. We advocate\\nan increase in both permanent and non-permanent\\nmembers, greater regional representativeness, enhanced\\nCouncil efficiency and a limitation of the right of veto.\\nThe right of veto is incompatible with the general\\ninterest. It should be possible to modify the\\ndecision-making mechanism so as to avoid recourse to\\nthis instrument, which has become entirely obsolete.\\nBelgium also pleads for more transparency and closer\\ncooperation between the Security Council and countries\\ncontributing to peacekeeping operations.\\nSuch organizational and financial reform can\\nsucceed only if it can rely upon a team of officials who\\nsee themselves as being at the service of the Organization\\nand of the common good. Ultimately, an Organization\\nreformed along these lines and better able to meet global\\nchallenges will have to strengthen its ties with and\\ncomplement regional organizations, not only in the\\npolitical field but also at the social and economic level. It\\nwill not be possible to make our world more humane\\nwithout the joint effort of all international organizations\\nin support of a global approach. In this effort, the United\\nNations, together with regional and specialized\\ninstitutions, is a beacon of hope for millions of people.\\nStrengthening the United Nations also means\\nstrengthening its ties with other organizations and\\nassociations so that they can keep pace with the overall\\nreshaping of our Organization and of our world vision.\\nI should like to provide two examples. With regard\\nto its policy on Africa, Belgium again stresses the need\\nfor an objective approach on the one hand and\\naccountability on the other. The approach that we wish to\\npromote is based on universal principles, the most\\nimportant of which is that of human rights sustained by\\nmutual respect based on equality. It is high time that we\\nprogressed to true mental decolonization. Efforts\\noriginating in the region itself should be given every\\nchance to prosper and should be fully recognized by the\\ninternational community. As for Central Africa in\\nparticular, our common efforts should give priority to the\\nreconstruction and democratization of the Congo, in the\\ninterests not only of that country and its people, but of\\nstability in the Great Lakes region as a whole.\\nOn the other hand, in certain areas, such as\\nEastern Slavonia, United Nations “blue helmets” have\\nsucceeded in separating warring parties, protecting\\npopulations and preparing for reconstruction. It is\\ntherefore the responsibility first of the parties\\nthemselves and then of the international community to\\nmake every effort to prevent these achievements from\\nslipping away. By extension, this is also true for the\\nregion as a whole. With regard to Eastern Slavonia in\\nparticular, it is important for the activities of the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to\\nbe based on the accomplishments of the United Nations\\nTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and for such\\nactivities to be inspired by and based upon United\\nNations experience in the region.\\nI should now like to focus on another\\ncontemporary issue: disarmament. Needless to say,\\nweapons of mass destruction should be forbidden. But\\nthis is also true for weapons whose sole purpose is to\\ndestroy human beings, such as anti-personnel\\nlandmines. In Angola, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cambodia\\nand elsewhere, these indiscriminate and cowardly\\nweapons kill some 9,600 people and maim another\\n14,000 every year. They kill and mutilate more people\\nthan all the weapons of mass destruction put together.\\nIt is high time that these devices were banned. In\\nless than two years the objective of a total ban on\\nanti-personnel landmines has met with a positive\\nresponse in most parts of the world. Belgium, which\\nwas keen to play a leading role in this field, fully\\nsupports this objective. As chairman of the international\\nconference on a total ban on anti-personnel landmines,\\nwhich took place in Brussels in June, I myself noted\\nthe existence of the political will necessary to achieve a\\nban by the end of 1997.\\nThe recent conclusion in Oslo of the negotiations\\non a legally binding instrument means that most of us\\nwill be able to go to Ottawa in early December to sign\\nthis important treaty. My country made a great effort to\\nensure that we produced a strong legal instrument, with\\nno exceptions or reservations, and we also advocated\\nthat assistance to landmine victims should be an\\nessential part of this convention. Belgium is pleased to\\nnote that this international humanitarian standard will\\nsoon become a reality and invites all other States to\\n30\\n\\n\\njoin in the effort. It is also my firm hope that States will\\nnot wait for the treaty to come into force before they\\nhonour this total ban.\\nHumanitarian tragedies will continue to occur\\nthroughout the world. Whatever their origins, crises are\\nbecome increasingly complicated. Still considerable in\\nnumber, they create countless victims and immense\\nhuman suffering. Despite greater solidarity and increased\\nhumanitarian assistance granted by a growing number of\\nhumanitarian and non-governmental organizations,\\ndifficulties on the ground have continued to grow in\\nrecent years. Above all, in addition to the problem of\\naccess to victims, the lack of security and total disregard\\nfor international humanitarian law and human rights\\nrequire our particular attention. Indeed, I am especially\\nworried about the recent increase in aggression against\\nhumanitarian personnel. These acts are often carried out\\nwith the sole purpose of blocking their access to\\npopulations who are suffering. It goes without saying that\\nthe authorities hosting the humanitarian workers bear\\nprimary responsibility for their safety.\\nThese authorities must also ensure respect for\\nhumanitarian law, based on values for which a consensus\\nexists within the international community but whose\\nconcrete application on the ground remains a daily\\nchallenge. This is another task for the United Nations.\\nExisting legal instruments must be strengthened and\\nexpanded in order to extend the same maximum\\nprotection to humanitarian personnel in the field as is\\ncurrently provided for military personnel in peacekeeping\\nmissions. In addition, the directives on humanitarian law\\nsuch as those proposed by the International Committee of\\nthe Red Cross should also be revitalized and thoroughly\\nexamined.\\nOur Organization is increasingly confronted with\\ncrises that require global responses comprising not only\\ntheir humanitarian dimensions, but also their military,\\neconomic, political and social dimensions. In these\\ncircumstances, humanitarian organizations must not only\\ncontinue to ensure a thorough coordination of the\\nassistance delivered, but also develop stepped-up\\nconvergence between, for instance, United Nations Blue\\nHelmets involved in peacekeeping missions and\\nhumanitarian workers.\\nGreater interaction and cooperation between them is\\nimperative if we wish to devise an integrated and suitable\\nresponse to the ever more complex crisis situations facing\\nthe international community.\\nI believe that much remains to be done in order to\\nimprove and develop such cooperation: for example,\\njoint planning for crisis situations, training, defining\\nroles and mandates and, finally, implementation and\\nfollow-up of operations.\\nWe must bear in mind that humanitarian assistance\\nmust never be used for mere political purposes, and it\\ncannot by itself be intended to provide a lasting\\nsolution to a conflict. Humanitarian assistance should\\ntherefore never be a substitute for political, diplomatic\\nand military action.\\nIn this context, Belgium, in close cooperation with\\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, intends\\nto organize next year, an international seminar precisely\\non the relationship between humanitarian, political and\\nmilitary actions. The focus will be on interaction\\nbetween humanitarian, political and military actors in\\nsituations of crisis. This will be an opportunity to\\nanalyse closely the often widely varying approaches to\\nthis problem.\\nThe objective of international humanitarian\\nassistance is not only to guarantee the survival of\\nvictims of humanitarian tragedies. It should also help\\nthem be reintegrated into society. Viewed in this\\nfashion, humanitarian assistance is an important factor\\nin the protection of human dignity, human rights and\\nhumanitarian law. The international community must\\ntherefore put an end to the impunity of persons\\nresponsible for grave violations of international\\nhumanitarian law, whether committed against\\npopulations or humanitarian personnel.\\nThe creation of the ad hoc tribunals for the\\nprosecution and punishment of such violations and the\\nnecessary creation of a standing international criminal\\ncourt, are important steps towards the fulfilment of\\nthese goals.\\nHowever, it is essential that these international\\njudiciary bodies should be given a fair chance to carry\\nout their functions. Thus, their legal competence should\\nbe firmly established and recognized by all Member\\nStates.\\nRespect for human rights has become an essential\\nyardstick of the legitimacy of the exercise of State\\npower and is increasingly considered a vital part of a\\ncountry’s international status and influence. It has\\n31\\n\\n\\nbecome the new basis for the confidence we bestow on\\nour fellow Member States.\\nNext year the General Assembly will devote part of\\nits session to the commemoration of the fiftieth\\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights.\\nThat Declaration, without any doubt, is one of the\\nmost important texts of our times. It is the foundation of\\nthe whole array of standards that came after it and that\\nhave been incorporated into a number of international\\nlegal instruments. It is also the bedrock upon which rest\\nall United Nations activities aimed at better respect for\\nand promotion of human rights, in accordance with the\\nCharter.\\nIn the spirit of the Vienna World Conference on\\nHuman Rights, a growing number of Member States, in\\nfull exercise of their sovereignty, have accepted\\ninternational commitments by ratifying those human\\nrights instruments. However, I should like to express the\\nhope that Member States will also spare no effort in\\nhaving their provisions implemented. By so doing they\\nwill contribute to the universality of human rights.\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains\\nan inexhaustible source of hope for all those who are\\ndeprived of their rights, especially the victims of social,\\npolitical or economic exclusion or exploitation on the\\nbasis of their race, origin, religion, sex or any other\\ngrounds.\\nConsequently, I, fully subscribe to the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s stated intention to integrate human rights\\nhorizontally throughout the full range of United Nations\\nactivities. Belgium reiterates to the Secretary-General its\\nfull support in this respect.\\nLet me conclude by saying that my country will\\nmake every effort — nationally, regionally and\\nglobally — so that the commemoration of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights will be a resounding\\nsuccess that reflects the capital importance of the event.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffLet me express my\\npleasure at seeing you, Sir, the Foreign Minister of\\nUkraine — with which Austria has close historical links\\nand enjoys excellent relations — presiding over the\\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your profound\\nprofessional experience in the United Nations system\\nand your negotiating skills will ensure substantial\\nprogress in our ambitious agenda.\\nOn behalf of the Federal Government of Austria, I\\nshould also like to express our sincere appreciation to\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, whose wise leadership\\nof the Organization we fully support. In the short time\\nsince he took office he has succeeded in reaching out\\nnot only to Governments but also to the people and the\\nmedia, thus fostering a new awareness about the goals,\\naspirations and achievements of the United Nations as\\nthe indispensable instrument of global cooperation.\\nMy colleague from Luxembourg has already\\nexpressed the position of the European Union, which\\nwe fully endorse. I should like to elaborate on a few\\npoints to which Austria attaches particular importance.\\nThe United Nations is currently preparing itself for\\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. The\\nSecretary-General and his team, with the\\nencouragement of Member States, have initiated\\ncomprehensive reform. Austria welcomes this major\\neffort to redirect the Organization towards the needs of\\nthe future, and we fully endorse the Secretary-General's\\nproposals. In particular I should like to emphasize the\\nfollowing points: first, the streamlining of leadership\\nand management structure; secondly, the consolidation\\nof the United Nations presence in the field; thirdly, the\\nreturn of development to the centre of United Nations\\nactivities and the better combining of the potential of\\nUnited Nations funds and programmes; and, fourthly,\\nthe strengthening of human rights in all aspects of the\\nwork of the United Nations.\\n8\\n\\n\\nWithout adequate resources, however, the United\\nNations will not succeed in carrying out its tasks. As\\nlong as Member States do not fully honour their\\nobligations, the financial situation of the Organization\\nwill remain critical. Settling the arrears is therefore an\\nimperative. Austria is proud of its traditional record of\\npaying its contributions to the United Nations in full and\\non time. The serious political will and sincere\\ncommitment of every Government will be required.\\nNeedless to say, unilateral decisions are unacceptable in\\nthe framework of multilateral cooperation.\\nThe fight against drugs, crime and terrorism has\\nrightly become a first priority for the international\\ncommunity. Nearly 1 per cent of the world's population\\nabove the age of 15 today has abused stimulants. An\\nestimated 300 tons of heroin a year have been produced\\nduring this decade to supply about 8 million addicts.\\nWhile I hope that regional cooperation will soon\\ncontribute effectively to the fight against illegal\\ntrafficking and drug abuse, the Secretary-General's\\nintention to strengthen the United Nations capacities in\\nthis field deserves the support of all Member States.\\nAustria will cooperate closely with the newly\\nappointed Director-General of the United Nations Office\\nat Vienna, Mr. Pino Arlacchi. We are convinced that his\\nprofound knowledge and experience in fighting organized\\ncrime will be a strong asset in pooling the resources of\\nthe United Nations system, the Member States and\\nrelevant institutions. To demonstrate its support, Austria\\nwill make a significant financial contribution to the\\nUnited Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\\nTrust Fund.\\nIllegal migration is increasingly linked to\\ntransnational crime. The reckless exploitation of humans\\nin distress is a particularly reprehensible form of\\ninternational crime. An increasing number of people\\nsmuggled illegally across borders find themselves\\nhelpless victims deprived of all financial means and with\\nan illegal status in a foreign country. The perpetrators, at\\nthe same time, earn the profits and escape justice by\\ncynically making use of a loophole in the international\\ncriminal law regime. There is an urgent need for an\\ninternational legal instrument making the smuggling of\\nillegal migrants punishable as a transnational crime, thus\\nensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice.\\nI have asked legal experts to prepare a draft\\ninternational convention against the smuggling of illegal\\nmigrants. This draft is being circulated as an official\\ndocument under the appropriate agenda item. We\\npropose that the United Nations Commission on Crime\\nPrevention and Criminal Justice consider this draft as a\\nmatter of priority at its next session. I am confident that\\nour initiative will help in closing a dangerous legal\\nlacuna, thereby strengthening international judicial\\ncooperation in this field.\\nSubstance abuse and drug-related crimes continue\\nto take a high toll in both the developing and the\\nindustrialized worlds. Human and social development is\\nthreatened on a global scale. Strengthening and\\nupdating existing international anti-drug capacities will\\nrequire innovation and new methods. In this respect, the\\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to\\ninternational drug control, which is to be held in June\\n1998, will provide us with an excellent opportunity to\\nrenew our political commitment by closing our ranks\\nagainst illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for\\nprogress in preventive efforts.\\nAnti-personnel landmines constitute a particularly\\nmalicious threat to the security of individuals and\\ncountries. Even decades after the end of a conflict, such\\nas the Second World War, these hidden killers take a\\nterrible toll among civilian populations, killing or\\nmaiming more than 20,000 people each and every year.\\nEvery year 20 times more mines are laid than cleared.\\nEstimates speak of 110 million mines laid in more than\\n60 countries. I think that this spiral of death must be\\nstopped.\\nAustria was one of the first countries to ban anti-\\npersonnel landmines at the national level. We strongly\\nadvocated a total ban, and we prepared the draft for\\nsuch a convention. Non-governmental organizations\\nhave played a prominent role in creating the necessary\\nmomentum, and I would like to thank them respectfully\\nfor that on behalf of the Austrian Government. The\\nOslo Diplomatic Conference negotiated a treaty on this\\nbasis, and I look forward to signing the Convention in\\nOttawa, together with so many of my colleagues who\\nshare this goal. I urge the countries that were not able\\nto join the consensus in Oslo to become part of the\\nprocess as soon as possible.\\nTed Turner has generously earmarked a part of his\\nunprecedented $1 billion donation to support intensified\\ndemining efforts. I wish to thank him for this unique\\ngesture.\\n9\\n\\n\\nThe dignity and worth of the human person are\\nuniversal. Consequently, it is the duty of our universal\\nOrganization to help implement governmental\\ncommitments in this field. Since the Vienna World\\nConference on Human Rights, human rights have moved\\ninto the centre of United Nations programmes and\\nactivities. Austria welcomes this trend. There is an\\nintrinsic relationship between respect for human rights,\\ndemocracy and sustainable development. Guaranteeing\\nhuman rights is an essential precondition for lasting\\nsecurity and stability. This link has been highlighted by\\nthe Secretary-General in his commendable report on the\\nwork of the Organization.\\nI take this opportunity to warmly welcome the\\nappointment of President Mary Robinson as High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights and to pledge Austria's\\nfull support for her work. Her outstanding personality\\nwill undoubtedly contribute to further strengthening the\\nUnited Nations role in human rights.\\nThe review of the Vienna Declaration and\\nProgramme of Action and the fiftieth anniversary of the\\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights make 1998 the\\nyear of human rights. This will provide us with a unique\\nopportunity to shape the international human rights\\nprogramme for the new millennium. Its central objective\\nmust remain that international human rights standards be\\nrespected at the level of each nation. For this, the role of\\nGovernments is crucial; so is that of civil society. The\\ninternational community, therefore, not only has to ensure\\ncompliance with these commitments and provide the\\nnecessary assistance, but it must also promote the role of\\ncivil society. We see this year of human rights as an\\noccasion for reaching out to human rights defenders in all\\ncorners of the world. As host country of the World\\nConference and as the country assuming the presidency\\nof the European Union in the second half of 1998,\\nAustria offers its cooperation to ensure a successful\\nhuman rights year 1998 in all parts of the world.\\nAustria places great emphasis on the promotion and\\nprotection of minorities. We do so on the basis of our\\nhistorical experience and owing to our conviction that\\nethnic minorities do not threaten but rather enrich our\\nsocieties. In this context, I am pleased to refer to the\\nsuccessful solution of an important minority issue. The\\nAustrian minority in South Tyrol today enjoys a well-\\nbalanced autonomy on the basis of the Paris Treaty of\\n1946 between Austria and Italy. This autonomy has\\ngenerated considerable interest in other parts of the\\nworld.\\nWith regard to the human rights year, the\\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform continues to be\\na priority. In particular, Austria supports efforts to\\nstrengthen the Convention on the Elimination of All\\nForms of Discrimination against Women. We also are\\ncontributing to the enhanced practical implementation\\nof other international human rights treaties, such as the\\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, in particular\\nwith regard to juvenile justice.\\nEmployment, as a matter of growing global\\nconcern, rightly ranks high on the political agenda.\\nGovernments are urged to develop further instruments\\nto fight unemployment through the effective monitoring\\nof labour policies. The World Summit for Social\\nDevelopment in Copenhagen provided a set of\\nprinciples and goals in this respect. In order to confirm\\nthese commitments and to identify good practices, I\\nshould like to recall that Austria, as a follow-up to\\nCopenhagen, will host an international expert meeting\\non employment in early February 1998.\\nIn our joint efforts to promote sustainable\\ndevelopment, the peaceful use of outer space for the\\nbenefit of all countries has become an issue of rapidly\\ngrowing importance to the United Nations in the last\\nfew years. I should like to reaffirm the full support of\\nmy country for the United Nations aim to expand\\nactivities in this field. We welcome the holding of the\\nthird United Nations Conference on the Exploration and\\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space, which will be convened\\nas a special session of the Committee on the Peaceful\\nUses of Outer Space, open to all Member States, in\\nVienna in July 1999.\\nMy country is deeply committed to the peace\\nprocess in the former Yugoslavia, in particular in\\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The Dayton accords provide\\nthe framework for the return of Bosnia to normalcy and\\nstability, for its economic recovery and for\\nreconciliation among its ethnic groups. Full and\\ncomprehensive implementation of the Dayton\\nAgreement is therefore imperative. This includes\\nbringing to justice all indicted war criminals, wherever\\nthey may be. If we want to safeguard the Dayton\\nprocess, the international community must remain\\nfirmly committed to taking the necessary political,\\neconomic and military measures even beyond July\\n1998. International support must remain conditional on\\nfull compliance with all international obligations. I\\nshould like to pay a special tribute to the United\\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern\\n10\\n\\n\\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, which has made\\nan invaluable contribution to fostering peace in that\\nregion.\\nAustria is in favour of integrating the Federal\\nRepublic of Yugoslavia fully into the United Nations\\nfamily as soon as the necessary preconditions, including\\nthe application for membership, are fulfilled. In this\\nrespect, I stress our expectation that Belgrade will grant a\\nlarge degree of autonomy to Kosovo and the Albanian\\nminority.\\nAustria has followed the situation in the Middle East\\nwith great concern. We regret the fact that the peace\\nprocess has come to a near-standstill. The confidence\\nbuilt up by the Oslo process has been largely destroyed.\\nOur main task must be to re-establish and to strengthen\\nthis confidence step by step and to bring the parties back\\nto the negotiating table. The present situation increases\\nthe risk of extremist activity. A precondition for progress\\nin the peace process will certainly be respect by all\\nparties for the agreements concluded and the\\nengagements undertaken.\\nAustria is seriously preoccupied by the precarious\\neconomic and social situation in the Palestinian\\nterritories, where the unemployment rate is 70 per cent. It\\nis of paramount importance to create the necessary\\neconomic conditions as a basis for political stability.\\nThere will be no lasting peace without a credible\\nresponse to the economic needs of the people in the\\nregion.\\nSince 1960, Austria has participated very actively in\\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. Considering the\\ngrowing importance in contemporary peacekeeping of\\nregional arrangements under Chapter VIII of the Charter\\nof the United Nations, my country has started to\\ncooperate closely with those States and organizations that\\nhave taken leading roles in this field. In 1997 Austria\\nprovided about 1,200 troops, military observers and\\ncivilian police to 11 different peacekeeping operations\\nthroughout the world, including the Stabilization Force\\n(SFOR) and the operation in Albania.\\nAustria actively supports the standby arrangement\\nsystem, created in 1994, and in this connection took part\\nin establishing the United Nations Stand-by Forces High-\\nReadiness Brigade in December 1996, which was created\\nto build a capacity for quick preventive action and crisis\\nresponse.\\nI am deeply convinced that, especially in times of\\nscarce financial resources, the international community\\nshould make a greater investment in the field of conflict\\nprevention and preventive diplomacy. The United\\nNations has the mandate to take a leading role in\\nfurther developing instruments for preventive\\ndiplomacy.\\nAustria is, and will continue to be, a loyal\\nMember and a strong supporter of the world\\nOrganization. The United Nations — our\\nOrganization — is the only global instrument that can\\nprovide the necessary response to existing global\\nchallenges: eradicating poverty; protecting our planet's\\nenvironment; combating drugs, organized crime and\\nterrorism; and promoting human rights, including the\\nrights of children. To this end we have to strengthen\\nthe United Nations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'I have the honour and\\nprivilege to speak on behalf of the European Union. In\\nthis capacity I would like to extend my warm and sincere\\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President\\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are\\npleased that a distinguished Latin American statesman\\nchairs our deliberations. I am confident that your\\nexperience, talent and energy will ensure a successful\\noutcome for the work of our session.\\nI wish to express the high appreciation of the\\nEuropean Union for the outstanding leadership of the\\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, and for his excellent work\\nat the helm of the United Nations. His â€œquiet revolutionâ€\\x9d\\nof institutional reforms has our full support. We are\\nlooking forward to working with him to prepare the\\nMillennium Assembly in the year 2000 in order to meet\\nthe challenges of human solidarity.\\nAt the turn of the century, we live in a fascinating\\nand challenging, but also difficult and complex, period of\\ntime, characterized by uncertainty and unpredictability.\\nLocal wars and ethnic conflicts have continued and new\\nones have broken out. â€œPeace processesâ€\\x9d have had rather\\nmixed success, and some show a distressing tendency to\\nunravel. The threat from weapons of mass destruction is\\nas alarming as ever. A majority of the Earthâs population\\nstill lives in poverty. Enormous environmental disasters\\nhit our planet all too often, and organized crime, illicit\\ndrug trafficking and terrorism are the plague of our time.\\nFinancial and economic crises of unprecedented\\ndimensions do not spare any region â€” Asia and Russia\\nbeing the most recent examples.\\nThe impact of these phenomena is felt directly and\\nimmediately by every citizen in the world. Economies are\\nmore intertwined than ever, and information travels\\naround the globe within seconds. No one can escape the\\nforces of globalization, but all of us can join not only in\\nconfronting transnational threats but also in collecting the\\nfruits of globalization. The United Nations has a key part\\nto play in this collective effort. Only our universal\\norganization has the scope and legitimacy to generate the\\nprinciples, norms and rules that are essential to harness\\nthe potential of globalization while managing its negative\\neffects.\\n7\\n\\n\\nTodayâs turmoil in the financial markets can be dealt\\nwith only at a global level, addressing the political causes\\nas well as the financial and economic aspects. It is\\nimperative that industrial and developing countries elaborate\\na common strategy in a framework of international financial\\ncooperation, including the G-22, and formulate standards\\nand rules for financial transactions. What is needed now is\\nleadership. Short-term remedies are not enough; long-term\\nforward looking policies are required. We must invest in\\nboth sustainable growth and solidarity. As serious as the\\ncrisis is, there is every reason not to panic. The world\\neconomy is basically sound, with two thirds â€” 70 per\\ncent â€” of the worldâs population living in growth zones.\\nWe sometimes forget that.\\nThe European model of social market economy has\\nserved well to harness the forces of globalization.\\nRespecting the interests and wishes of the people, showing\\nsolidarity for the poor and disadvantaged, promoting social\\npartnership between employers and employees and\\ncombating unemployment by creating jobs and so on are\\nintrinsic elements of a social market economy. We believe\\nthat this European model of a social market economy\\ndeserves serious consideration in our turbulent and complex\\nage. To be honest, this is a kind of third way some are\\nlooking for.\\nEuropeâs answer to the challenges of globalization is\\ntwo millennium projects which will shape the face of our\\ncontinent: the introduction of the euro and the enlargement\\nof the Union.\\nThe single currency will improve the functioning of\\nthe internal market, help to secure employment and provide\\nincentives for the market-oriented structural reforms needed\\nto safeguard Europeâs competitiveness. The creation of the\\neuro has the potential to stabilize the international economic\\nenvironment and to promote international trade. From the\\nperspective of the world economy, this will be the most\\nimportant effect of the single currency. Markets have\\nalready anticipated the introduction of the euro, as borne\\nout by the monetary stability of the participating currencies,\\nat a time when other countries and regions are experiencing\\nsevere financial crises. Consequently, the euro is creating a\\nzone of stability and prosperity which will benefit the entire\\nworld economy.\\nThe second millennium project, which has far-reaching\\nconsequences, is the enlargement of the European Union.\\nWe are convinced that the integration of our neighbours is\\nthe best way to safeguard lasting political stability and\\neconomic progress in Europe. Successful enlargement will\\nbring a new dynamic to the Union and strengthen its role\\nto the benefit of all the citizens of both Europe and the\\nworld. The process of enlarging the Union does not mean\\nthat the Union will become more inward-oriented or\\nEurocentric. On the contrary, we are convinced that the\\nUnion must continue to be outward- and forward-looking.\\nEnlarging the European Union will go hand-in-hand with\\ndeveloping our traditional relations with countries and\\nexporting stability around the world.\\nAs President of the Council of the European Union,\\nI would like to assure Members of the United Nations\\nthat an enlarged Union with a strong common currency\\nwill be a reliable and strong partner for the United\\nNations and the world.\\nI would like to stress the paramount interest of the\\nEuropean Union in the political and economic stability of\\nRussia. We hope that the new Government of Russia will\\nbe able to re-establish confidence among the Russian\\npeople and the international financial community. We\\nstand ready to cooperate further with the Russian\\nauthorities in support of sustained efforts towards\\nstabilization and reform.\\nLet me now draw attention to a subject to which I\\nattach the highest priority: the protection of the most\\nvulnerable group in societies, our children. I am deeply\\nconvinced that a far-sighted policy, both internal and\\nexternal, should be geared to the well-being of future\\ngenerations. We, the statesmen, diplomats and decision\\nmakers of 185 nations, meeting in this Assembly, bear an\\nenormous responsibility to formulate future-oriented\\npolicies in the service of young citizens on our planet.\\nThese include a fundamental principle. Our children must\\nlive childhood in peace, freedom, prosperity and security,\\nfree of abuse, violence and exploitation.\\nMillions of children and juveniles are exploited\\nworldwide, their basic human rights denied in many ways.\\nA global coalition must be forged to fight the abuse of\\nchildren, in particular sexual exploitation, the despicable\\nphenomenon of child soldiers and child labour.\\nThe European Union supports the International\\nLabour Organization draft convention on child labour.\\nThe involvement of children in armed conflict and its\\ndisastrous consequences require particular attention and\\naction by the international community. I call upon all\\nStates and parties to conflicts to respect existing\\ninternational standards, to stop the use of children as\\ncombatants and to fully support the work of the\\nSecretary-Generalâs Special Representative for Children\\nin Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu.\\n8\\n\\n\\nSexual exploitation of children is one of the most\\nabhorrent phenomena of our time. The European Union\\nputs special emphasis on combating child prostitution and\\nchild pornography. This includes the spread of child\\npornography on the Internet. New information technologies\\ncreate new challenges. But that is why, more than ever, we\\nhave to prohibit the production, dissemination and\\npossession of child pornography in all its forms â€” print,\\naudio, electronic media and video. Many countries have\\nalready enacted such legislation nationally. But only a\\nworldwide ban on child pornography will be effective. In\\nthis context, we hope that the optional protocol on the sale\\nof children, child prostitution and child pornography can be\\nfinalized in the near future.\\nLegislative action has to be complemented by\\nimproved cooperation between national and international\\nlaw enforcement and judicial authorities. I appeal to\\nGovernments, the United Nations, non-governmental\\norganizations and private business â€” including online\\nservices and Internet service providers â€” to join efforts in\\na crusade against child abuse. For every day we fail to do\\nso, the innocent children of our world pay a terrible price.\\nHuman rights, good and democratic governance and\\nthe rule of law have moved to centre stage in promoting\\npeace, security and sustainable development. Respect for\\nand promotion of human rights have become a crucial\\ncomponent of Union policies. They play a significant role\\nin contractual relations with third countries, in development\\ncooperation and in the common foreign and security policy.\\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\\nof Human Rights and the five-year implementation review\\nof the Vienna Declaration should provide an opportunity for\\na critical assessment of the progress made by all States.\\nThe Council of the European Union, in commemorating this\\nanniversary on 10 December this year in Vienna, will send\\na strong signal to further strengthen the United Nations\\nhuman rights programme, in particular the Office of the\\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\\nThe European Union will continue to work towards\\nthe full integration of human rights, as well as a gender\\nperspective, into all activities of the United Nations system.\\nWe hope that the adoption of the human rights defenders\\ndeclaration will send a strong message of support to human\\nrights activists worldwide. The European Union welcomes\\nthe progress on a draft protocol to the Convention on the\\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,\\nand a draft protocol to the Convention against Torture. We\\nhope that the respective Working Groups can complete their\\nwork next year.\\nI would like to stress our strong interest in\\ncooperating with other Governments and civil society to\\nimprove the human rights situation in all parts of the\\nworld. To this end, the Union supports a wide range of\\nprojects and programmes in the field of human rights, the\\nrule of law and electoral assistance. We will also work\\nfor the complete abolition of the death penalty. In the\\nmeantime, we shall call for a moratorium on all\\nexecutions worldwide.\\nThe international community is confronted with an\\nincreasing number of new and more diverse forms of\\nconflict, which often turn violent. Apart from taking\\nmeasures of operational prevention, which address the\\nconsequences of conflicts and range from preventive\\ndiplomacy to all forms of peaceful settlement of disputes\\nand the preventive deployment of forces, we have to\\nconcentrate on the root causes, such as disrespect for\\nminorities. We therefore need a pro-active policy,\\nfocusing on preventing the outbreak of violence at an\\nearly stage.\\nEarly warning is a key element of a comprehensive\\nstrategy of conflict prevention and a prerequisite for any\\nfurther action. Finally, post-conflict rehabilitation has to\\nbe more comprehensive and coordinated to address the\\nwider issues of humanitarian assistance, reconstruction\\nand respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of\\nlaw. The European Union firmly supports United Nations\\nefforts to strengthen its conflict-prevention and crisis-\\nmanagement capacity.\\nWe are deeply committed to the primary role of the\\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peace\\nand security and to the core functions of United Nations\\npeacekeeping operations. This strong support is reflected\\nin the facts: 4,500 troops and policemen from European\\nUnion countries serve in United Nations peacekeeping\\noperations, which is one third of United Nations\\npeacekeeping personnel; thousands more men and women\\nfrom the European Union have served and are serving in\\nUnited Nations-mandated operations such as the\\nStabilization Force in Bosnia; and our financial\\ncontribution represents almost 40 per cent of the United\\nNations peacekeeping budget.\\nWe welcome the increasingly multidimensional\\nnature of peacekeeping operations, which poses new\\nchallenges to the average peacekeeper in the field.\\nPeacekeeping today encompasses not only military tasks\\nbut a variety of other functions, such as civilian police\\nactivities, humanitarian assistance, demining, disarmament\\nmeasures, demobilization, reintegration of former soldiers,\\n9\\n\\n\\nenhancing and monitoring respect for human rights and, last\\nbut not least, public information. At United Nations\\nHeadquarters, this requires a strong Department of\\nPeacekeeping Operations which is able to fulfil its functions\\neffectively. In the wake of the decision by the General\\nAssembly to reduce progressively the number of posts filled\\nby personnel on loan, we strongly underline that the\\nDepartmentâs expertise and gains of recent years must be\\nretained.\\nThe European Union is gravely concerned about the\\nincreasing security threat to United Nations personnel in the\\nfield, not least to unarmed military observers and civilian\\npersonnel. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the United\\nNations and Member States towards those participating in\\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, we wish to recall\\nthe obligation of host countries and parties to conflicts to\\nensure the safety of these operations.\\nI would like to express our admiration and gratitude to\\nall the men and women who serve under the banner of the\\nUnited Nations in peace operations around the globe. They\\nshow remarkable courage, motivation and idealism.\\nLikewise, I wish to express my deep sympathy to the\\nfamilies of United Nations personnel who have lost their\\nlives in the service of peace.\\nThe European Union attaches the utmost importance\\nto progress in the areas of disarmament, arms control and\\nnon-proliferation as a key element in the maintenance of\\npeace and the strengthening of security. In this respect, the\\nUnion wishes to reiterate its deep concern about the grave\\nthreat to international peace and security posed by the\\nnuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan in May this\\nyear. The Union has called on both countries to adhere to\\ninternational non-proliferation regimes, in particular by\\nsigning the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as it\\nstands. The Union strongly urges India and Pakistan to\\nrefrain from nuclear tests and from the development or\\ndeployment of nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable\\nmissiles. Likewise, we call on both countries to engage in\\na substantive dialogue with each other and to agree on\\nconfidence-building measures.\\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation\\nregime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of\\nnuclear disarmament. We are committed to the early entry\\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\\nand welcome the recent ratifications by several countries.\\nWe call upon all States which have not yet done so to\\naccede to it, without any change. The conclusion of a fissile\\nmaterial cut-off treaty will constitute a significant\\ncontribution to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.\\nWe warmly welcome the fact that all impediments to\\nstarting such negotiations finally have been overcome, and\\nwe are looking forward to contributing to the substantive\\nnegotiations. We continue to believe that the systematic\\nand progressive efforts by nuclear-weapon States to\\nreduce nuclear weapons need to be intensified and\\npursued with determination.\\nBiological weapons pose grave dangers. It is\\nshocking that they can also be produced by non-State\\nactors. Therefore, the European Union gives priority to\\nstrengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons\\nConvention. We strive for the successful conclusion of\\nthe negotiations on a legally binding protocol establishing\\na verification and compliance regime in 1999. I would\\nalso like to underline our commitment to the universality\\nand the full and effective implementation of the Chemical\\nWeapons Convention, a landmark in the disarmament\\nprocess.\\nThe European Union reaffirms its commitment to the\\ngoal of totally eliminating anti-personnel landmines\\nworldwide and welcomes the opening for signature of the\\nOttawa Convention. We are pleased that the number of\\nsignatories and ratifications is rising steadily and that the\\nConvention will enter into force on 1 March 1999. The\\nfact that the required number of 40 ratifications was\\nreached so quickly underlines the importance that the\\ninternational community attaches to this endeavour. The\\nEuropean Union, being the major donor to anti-mine\\nactivities, is contributing significantly to solving the\\nproblems caused by those weapons.\\nA serious challenge to the international community\\nis raised by the combination of internal conflicts and the\\nproliferation of small arms. This issue requires a multi-\\npronged response. The Union, for its part, has adopted a\\ncode of conduct on arms exports and has thereby set high\\ncommon standards. Moreover, we are currently engaged\\nin the implementation of the European Union programme\\nfor preventing and combating illicit trafficking in\\nconventional arms. Under this programme, we will assist\\nthird countries in preventing and combating illicit\\ntrafficking in arms, and we will also assist affected\\ncountries.\\nAs we approach the new millennium, nearly a\\nquarter of the worldâs people â€” foremost among them\\nwomen and children â€” continue to live in absolute\\npoverty, while almost a third more are very poor. While\\nthe blight of poverty thus continues to challenge the\\ninternational community, recent decades have also shown\\n10\\n\\n\\nthat progress in the reduction of poverty is possible. The\\ngoal of poverty eradication, through sustained growth and\\neconomic and social development, must be placed at the\\ncentre of international development cooperation.\\nPoverty has many dimensions and needs to be tackled\\nin a gender-sensitive and comprehensive way within the\\ncontext of sustainable development, based on the\\ninterdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of\\neconomic development, social development and\\nenvironmental protection. The European Union therefore\\nattaches great importance to an integrated and coordinated\\nfollow-up to global conferences. While the first\\nresponsibility lies with Governments, the United Nations\\nsystem, as the global framework for international\\ncooperation, has a key role to play in supporting and\\ncoordinating national efforts.\\nA new global partnership between developing\\ncountries, developed countries, multilateral institutions and\\ncivil society, with emphasis put on local ownership and\\ncomplementarity of efforts, must be forged in order to\\nachieve people-centred sustainable development. The strong\\ncommitment of the Union to such a global partnership is\\nbased on its unique position as the worldâs largest provider\\nof development assistance.\\nAmong the various frameworks, the present LomÃ©\\nConvention, which will expire in February 2000, remains\\nessential. During the upcoming negotiations on a successor,\\nthe European Union will aim at strengthening its\\npartnership with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and\\nthe Pacific. Building on the experience gained so far, the\\naim is to develop a modern and efficient framework for\\ncooperation in order to keep the relationship between the\\nUnion and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries\\nstrong and prominent in the twenty-first century. I am\\nconvinced that cooperation in the context of the LomÃ©\\nConvention will make an effective contribution to\\neradicating poverty and integrating the African, Caribbean\\nand Pacific countries into our worldwide economic system.\\nWe are committed to sustainable development as the\\noverarching principle of national policy and international\\ncooperation in our policies. Recognizing the central role of\\na healthy environment in quality of life, the European\\nUnion attaches great importance to reform of the United\\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United\\nNations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT). We\\nwould welcome more coordination, focus and efficiency in\\nthese areas. The Kyoto Protocol, in which the member\\nStates of the European Union committed themselves to a\\nreduction of 8 per cent in greenhouse gases, constitutes an\\nimportant step towards sustainable development. As\\ndeveloped countries, we are prepared to take the lead in\\ncombating climate change. The European Community and\\nits member States are determined to translate the\\ncommitments made at Kyoto into concrete actions and\\nachievements.\\nIn the context of sustainable development, population\\nissues are of particular concern. They directly relate to\\nhuman health and the quality of life. Over the coming\\ndecades, population size and age structure will be\\nimportant factors interacting with economic development\\nand the environment in all parts of the world. It is\\ntherefore very timely that a special session of the General\\nAssembly will be convened next year to review and\\nappraise the implementation of the Programme of Action\\nof the International Conference on Population and\\nDevelopment, held in Cairo in 1994.\\nThe fight against drugs is a major priority in the\\npolicy of the European Union. The recent special session\\nof the General Assembly on the world drug problem was\\nan important step in the international effort to counter the\\nglobal scourge of drug abuse. I should like to pay tribute\\nto the Executive Director of the United Nations Drug\\nControl Programme (UNDCP), Pino Arlacchi, and all\\nothers involved, for the excellent preparation of the\\nsession. Political leaders unanimously endorsed a series of\\nimportant documents, including a Political Declaration,\\nseveral action plans, time-frames and a number of\\nconcrete measures.\\nWe welcome the balanced, integrated and gender-\\nsensitive anti-drug strategy adopted by the special session.\\nOur new commitments embrace efforts on both the supply\\nand the demand side, constituting equal parameters of the\\ndrug-control equation. In particular, we look forward to\\nthe elaboration of an operational action programme on\\ndemand reduction. We from the European Union fully\\nsupport an effective and rapid follow-up and\\nimplementation programme of the outcome of the special\\nsession.\\nIn the light of the important new and extensive\\nmandates in the field of international drug control, the\\ndonor base of UNDCP must be broadened. The European\\nUnion will continue to support the valuable work of\\nUNDCP, the international lead agency in the follow-up to\\nthe special session.\\nThe fight against organized crime â€” and the work\\nof the United Nations Centre for International Crime\\nPrevention â€” is of foremost importance. In this context\\n11\\n\\n\\nwe welcome closer cooperation between UNDCP and the\\nCrime Prevention Centre in order to enhance the synergy of\\nthese programmes. The danger which transnational\\norganized crime poses to the world community by creeping\\ninto many aspects of our societies must be met by effective\\ninternational measures. Therefore, we support the\\nelaboration of a convention against transnational organized\\ncrime and are pleased about the constructive and productive\\nspirit of the preparatory meeting in Buenos Aires.\\nThe horrible bomb attacks in Africa and Northern\\nIreland have brought terrorism back to the forefront of\\ninternational concern. The General Assembly, setting norms\\nand standards for the fight against terrorism, has passed a\\nnumber of resolutions and adopted no fewer than 11 anti-\\nterrorism conventions. The Sixth Committee is currently\\nnegotiating a convention on the suppression of acts of\\nnuclear terrorism. Its early finalization would signal the\\ndetermination of the international community to relentlessly\\npursue terrorists. Only through concerted action can we win\\nthe battle against terrorists. The more countries join in this\\neffort, the fewer the safe havens where terrorists can run or\\nhide.\\nThe successful completion of the Conference for the\\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court is an\\nachievement of historic dimensions. The European Union\\nfully endorses the outcome of the Rome Conference and the\\nStatute, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority\\nof participating States. This Statute lays the foundation for\\nan effective and credible Court as an institution to fight\\nimpunity for the most heinous crimes and to deter, once\\nand for all, their commission, thereby contributing to the\\nglobal advancement of peace and democracy. This session\\nof the General Assembly must adopt the appropriate\\ndecisions to make the Court a reality. The European Union\\nstands ready to do its utmost to contribute to the\\naccomplishment of these tasks.\\nAs in the past, the European Union describes its\\nrelations with third countries, and its position on areas of\\nconflict throughout the world, in a memorandum that is\\ncirculated as an integral part of this address. The\\nmemorandum is a useful compendium of the common\\nforeign and security policy of the Union and of relevant\\nCommunity policies. I will highlight just a few positions.\\nWe are extremely concerned at the dramatic escalation\\nof tension in Kosovo. Hundreds of people have been killed,\\nmore than 250,000 refugees have been forced to leave their\\nhomes as a result of armed clashes, and the threat of a\\nhumanitarian catastrophe is becoming ever more real. The\\nprimary responsibility for the devastating situation rests\\nwith the Serb and Yugoslav authorities, since their police\\nand military operations have led to consequences for the\\ncivilian population that are out of any justifiable\\nproportion. Therefore, it is up to President Slobodan\\nMilosevic to order a halt to all repressive actions against\\nthe civilian population in Kosovo. At the same time, the\\nUnion expects that all parties concerned reject all forms\\nof violence.\\nThe Union, together with humanitarian organizations,\\nhas started a series of projects in order to create\\nfavourable conditions for a return process for refugees\\nbefore the winter comes. A complete cessation of armed\\nactivities and a progressive withdrawal of Serb forces is\\nneeded now to make people confident enough to return to\\ntheir homes. The European Union urges the Federal\\nRepublic of Yugoslavia authorities to allow unimpeded\\naccess to all areas of Kosovo for humanitarian\\norganizations and observers and international forensic\\nexperts.\\nNegotiations between both sides, with international\\ninvolvement, should take place as soon as possible to\\nagree upon confidence-building measures and to define a\\nnew status for Kosovo. However, without a cessation of\\nthe ongoing Serb offensive, an end to further bloodshed\\nand a significant improvement of the catastrophic\\nhumanitarian situation, a meaningful dialogue cannot be\\nstarted. The European Union hopes that progress towards\\ndemocracy, which is a prerequisite for the resolution of\\nthe conflict, can be achieved in the Federal Republic of\\nYugoslavia. The final objective of the reform process\\nshould be the full integration of the Federal Republic of\\nYugoslavia into the international community.\\nThe Union remains fully committed to the\\nimplementation of the Dayton Accords, to political and\\neconomic stabilization, the return of refugees and the\\nstrengthening of civil society in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nThe past year has seen substantial progress due to strong\\npressure by the international community. We hope that\\nthe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina will\\ncontribute to the reconciliation of the ethnic communities\\nand to the construction of a new civil society.\\nWith regard to Albania, the European Union is\\nseriously concerned at the recent outbreak of violence\\nfollowing the assassination of a leading politician of an\\nopposition party. The European Union calls on all\\nAlbanian political parties to adopt a constructive attitude\\nto solving the crisis by peaceful means through political\\nconsultations. It urges the parties to renounce any strategy\\nof confrontation and to avoid fighting and violent\\n12\\n\\n\\ndemonstrations. Further violence will make national\\nreconciliation even more difficult.\\nWe sincerely hope that the instability still widespread\\nin Albania will soon be overcome, in particular by\\novercoming the current political difficulties caused by\\nhatred, mutual mistrust and various actions by both the\\nGovernment and the main opposition party. The Union\\nreminds all political factions of their obligation not to\\ndeepen the political divide, but rather to develop a spirit of\\ncooperation.\\nThe Union will continue its assistance according to\\nprogress made in the political dialogue as well as in the\\nstabilization of institutions, especially in the field of police\\naction.\\nThe European Union stresses once again that the status\\nquo in Cyprus is not acceptable. It reaffirms its strong\\nsupport for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his\\nSpecial Representative aimed at a negotiated and lasting\\nsolution to the Cyprus question, respecting the sovereignty,\\nindependence, territorial integrity and unity of the country\\nin accordance with the relevant Security Council\\nresolutions, with the goal of a bizonal, bicommunal\\nfederation on Cyprus.\\nThe Union started accession negotiations with the\\nRepublic of Cyprus on 31 March of this year. The\\naccession process and progress towards a political solution\\nshould reinforce one another. Accession to the Union\\nshould benefit all communities and help to bring about\\npeace and reconciliation on the island.\\nIn this context, we welcome the appointment of the\\nnew United Nations Deputy Special Representative, Dame\\nAnn Hercus.\\nThe European Union remains deeply concerned at the\\ncontinuing standstill in the Middle East peace process,\\nwhich constitutes a threat to the stability of the region. The\\nUnion considers the Middle East peace process to be the\\nonly path to security and peace for Israel, the Palestinians\\nand the neighbouring States. A just and durable solution is\\nin the fundamental interest of the European Union.\\nOur approach was reaffirmed at the meeting of the\\nEuropean Council held in Cardiff in June 1998. We\\ncontribute actively to efforts to promote the peace process,\\nproviding not only substantial economic support but also\\nadding our political weight to the search for a solution. It\\nis of the utmost importance to restore trust and confidence\\nbetween the parties. The pillars of a solution continue to be\\nin the principles agreed at Madrid and Oslo, especially\\nland for peace, the full implementation of existing\\ncommitments of the Israeli/Palestinian Interim Agreement\\nand the relevant Security Council resolutions.\\nWe call on Israel to recognize the right of the\\nPalestinians to self-determination without excluding the\\noption of a state of their own. On the other side, we call\\nupon the Palestinians to reaffirm their commitment to\\nIsraelâs right to live within recognized and safe borders.\\nWe also reiterate our opposition to Israeli settlements in\\noccupied Arab territories and to other unilateral measures,\\nsuch as the changing of the status of Jerusalem. More\\nthan any other issues, such acts, as well as the continued\\nexpansion of settlements, undermine the Palestiniansâ\\nconfidence in the peace process.\\nThe European Union will continue to provide\\nassistance to the Palestinian people. The positive\\ndevelopment of the Palestinian economy is a precondition\\nfor political stability.\\nWe want to express our concern at the lack of\\nprogress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, and we\\nunderline the need for a continuing effort in order to\\nachieve a solution.\\nThe Union supports the efforts of the United States\\nto relaunch the negotiations. We consider that every\\navenue should be explored in order to restore a spirit of\\nmutual trust and constructive negotiations. In this respect,\\nwe think that the recent proposals put forward by France\\nand Egypt, as well as by our European Union Special\\nEnvoy, should be studied positively.\\nAfrica, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, stands at the\\ncrossroads once more. In his landmark report (A/52/871)\\nentitled â€œThe causes of conflict and the promotion of\\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ€\\x9d,\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan provided us with a clear\\nanalysis and a framework for a comprehensive policy.\\nThe European Union is deeply concerned about the\\nterrible toll that recent and current conflicts have taken,\\nespecially on innocent civilians. In spite of important\\nregional and subregional efforts, the instability appears to\\nbe spreading, and creating a downward spiral that simply\\nhas to be stopped. I therefore urge the international\\ncommunity to continue to complement African efforts to\\nsolve their problems, as it has done by establishing the\\nUnited Nations Mission in the Central African Republic\\n(MINURCA) and the United Nations Observer Mission in\\nSierra Leone (UNOMSIL). The Union would welcome\\nfurther development of regional and subregional\\n13\\n\\n\\ncooperation and integration among African countries. We\\nhope that the summit between the European Union and the\\nSouthern African Development Community in Vienna in\\nNovember will make an important contribution.\\nThe Secretary-Generalâs report rightly focuses on the\\nimportance of creating an environment in which durable\\npeace is sustained and economic growth promoted.\\nRecognizing that peace and security are indispensable\\npreconditions, we emphasize the need for good governance,\\nincluding respect for human rights and the rule of law.\\nThese values are essential pillars of the European Unionâs\\ndevelopment policy, which over several decades has been\\ncentred on a genuine partnership with Africa.\\nThe European Union is particularly concerned about\\nthe ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\\nand the wider dangers for the region as a whole from the\\nescalation of the conflict. In this respect, we hope that the\\nEuropean Union Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region,\\nMr. Aldo Ajello, will continue to work together with the\\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General of the United\\nNations.\\nWe urge all the parties involved in the conflict of the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to respect human rights\\nand humanitarian law and to abstain from acts of violence\\nagainst civilians. We welcome African initiatives to find a\\npeaceful solution to this conflict, which can be solved only\\nthrough a negotiated settlement acceptable to all Congolese.\\nThis would allow the Democratic Republic of the Congo\\nand other countries of the region to find the peace and\\nstability that are prerequisites for their development. The\\nUnion remains ready to help this political dialogue and to\\nsupport any negotiation scheme obtaining the consent of all\\nparties involved, inter alia, through the assistance of our\\nSpecial Envoy for the Great Lakes region. A regional\\nconference could be useful at a later stage to consider the\\nrelevant aspects and to strengthen regional cooperation.\\nWe are determined to play an effective role in efforts\\nto stop the fighting and restore peace, stability and respect\\nfor human rights in Afghanistan. We are committed to\\nbringing about a sustainable peace in Afghanistan, putting\\nan end to foreign intervention, and encouraging intra-\\nAfghan dialogue, in particular through support for the\\ncentral role of the United Nations. The European Union\\nattaches special importance to the fight against illegal drugs\\nand terrorism in Afghanistan.\\nWe remain gravely concerned at the persistent human\\nrights violations and breaches of humanitarian law in\\nAfghanistan. We denounce the continuing discrimination\\nagainst girls and women in that country. We strongly urge\\nall factions, and in particular the Taliban, to recognize,\\nprotect and promote human rights. And we strongly urge\\nthem to end discriminatory policies and to recognize,\\nprotect and promote equal rights and dignity for men and\\nwomen.\\nNon-governmental organizations will be able to\\nreturn to Kabul only when the authorities in Afghanistan\\nhave met the necessary conditions.\\nWe reiterate our strong concern for the security of\\nUnited Nations personnel, other related personnel and\\npersonnel of non-governmental organizations in\\nAfghanistan, and we recall the responsibility of all\\nfactions to ensure safety, security and freedom of\\nmovement. We condemn the recent attack against two\\nstaff members of the United Nations Special Mission to\\nAfghanistan (UNSMA) and the killing of Iranian\\ndiplomats in northern Afghanistan, and we demand an\\nurgent investigation into these atrocious acts. We call on\\nthe Taliban to cooperate fully in ensuring the safe release\\nof the remaining diplomats and other Iranian nationals\\nmissing in Afghanistan.\\nWe have been deeply involved in the electoral\\nprocess in Cambodia, especially in voter registration and\\npoll observation, dispatching some 200 election observers\\nwho cooperated exceptionally well with the United\\nNations and other observer groups in the Joint\\nInternational Observer Group.\\nWe call upon all political forces in Cambodia to\\nseize this opportunity to work together, to the fullest\\nextent possible, towards national reconciliation, and\\nexpress the hope that, with the elections, the foundation\\nfor the future well-being and prosperity of the people of\\nCambodia has been laid. Return to political normalcy will\\nencourage the Union to consider new assistance\\nprogrammes to help Cambodia in its economic recovery.\\nThe Union notes with satisfaction the results\\nachieved at the August meeting in New York, under the\\nauspices of Mr. Kofi Annan, between the Foreign\\nMinisters of Indonesia and Portugal on the question of\\nEast Timor. We commend the Secretary-General and his\\nPersonal Representative for their efforts in this regard.\\nWe welcome the Ministersâ agreement to enter into\\nin-depth negotiations on issues related to the question of\\nEast Timor, addressed in the final communiquÃ© of the\\nmeeting, without prejudice to their basic positions of\\nprinciple. We hope that these negotiations will lead to a\\n14\\n\\n\\njust, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution\\nin the near future, respecting the rights and legitimate\\naspirations of the people, in accordance with the resolutions\\nof the General Assembly and with the principles enshrined\\nin the United Nations Charter. We welcome the prospect of\\nthe closer involvement of the East Timorese in the search\\nfor a solution.\\nI am deeply concerned at the continuing violations of\\nhuman rights and lack of progress towards democracy in\\nBurma/Myanmar. We strongly deplore the repressive\\nactions of the Burmese authorities, including the arrest of\\nseveral hundred members of the opposition. We call upon\\nthe State Peace and Development Council once again to\\nbring human rights violations to an end and to enter into a\\nsubstantive dialogue with opposition leaders, especially and\\nincluding Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of\\nethnic minorities, in order to establish democratic rule in\\naccordance with the will of the people as expressed in\\ndemocratic elections held in 1990. The Union seeks to\\ncooperate closely with other countries, in particular in the\\nregion, to resolve the worrying situation in the country.\\nAlthough the challenges of the twenty-first century\\nwill be different from those we have been used to dealing\\nwith in past decades, we are convinced that the United\\nNations will become more indispensable than ever as the\\nforum for global cooperation. What we have to do now is\\nto make our world Organization fit for the next century.\\nThe Secretary-Generalâs reform programme is excellent.\\nThe reform of our world Organization is in the interest\\nof all Member States. Of course, reform is not a cost-\\ncutting exercise alone, but an ongoing process which will\\nultimately lead to a substantial improvement of the work\\ndone in the United Nations family. This process will help\\nthe Organization to better focus on the fulfilment of\\nmandates and on the improvement of programme delivery.\\nConsequently, the European Union will continue vigorously\\nto support reform based on the proposals of the Secretary-\\nGeneral and the decisions of the General Assembly.\\nAs far as the organization and methods of work of\\nintergovernmental bodies are concerned, and especially of\\nthe General Assembly, we attach particular importance to\\nthe implementation of the reforms already agreed upon. We\\nwould welcome further improvements, particularly the\\nstreamlining of agendas, the reduction of duplication and\\nbetter coordination between bodies dealing with similar\\nissues.\\nThe European Union firmly believes that the General\\nAssembly should concentrate on implementing the\\nsignificant agreements reached in some working groups of\\nthe General Assembly and at the major United Nations\\nconferences. Carefully wrought compromises that allowed\\nadoption by consensus were the result of a great amount\\nof time and energy invested by all Member States.\\nThe European Union is firmly committed to finding\\nsolutions to the United Nations financial crisis.\\nContinuing high levels of unpaid assessments are\\nundermining the financial stability and liquidity, and\\ntherefore the purpose and goal, of the United Nations.\\nThis places a heavy and unfair burden upon troop-\\ncontributing countries. The member States of the\\nEuropean Union have consistently honoured their\\nfinancial obligations towards the United Nations. They\\npay their contributions in full, on time and without\\nconditions. A sound financial basis requires that all\\nMember States fulfil their Charter obligations. The United\\nStates cannot be exempt from such obligations.\\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, the\\nUnited States has a special responsibility towards the\\nUnited Nations. We express our sincere hope that\\nWashington will soon settle its arrears and live up to the\\nlegitimate expectations of Member States of the United\\nStatesâ role in the world Organization.\\nThe European Union has grown from 100 million\\npeople to 400 million today. With only 8 per cent of the\\nworld population, the Union provides for 60 per cent of\\ndevelopment and 50 per cent of humanitarian assistance.\\nEighty per cent of international aid to Russia and the\\nrepublics of the former Soviet Union, and 50 per cent of\\nthe assistance to the Palestinian territories are paid by the\\nEuropean Union. Forty per cent of the reconstruction help\\nto Bosnia and Herzegovina come from the member States\\nof the European Union. We are the strongest supporter of\\nthe United Nations. Our contributions account for 36 per\\ncent of the regular budget and 39 per cent of the\\npeacekeeping budget. The Union is ready to use its\\npolitical weight for the benefit of the entire international\\ncommunity, in particular developing countries.\\nLet me conclude by reaffirming the European\\nUnionâs deep commitment to the purposes and principles\\nof the United Nations Charter. We will continue to\\nsupport strongly the United Nations and the Secretary-\\nGeneral in carrying out the key objectives: the\\nmaintenance of international peace and security, economic\\nand social progress, and the promotion of human rights\\nand democratic freedoms.\\n15\\n\\n\\nThe message of the European Union to the United\\nNations is clear. At the threshold of the new millennium,\\nwe face common threats and challenges. We must join\\nforces to harness the benefits and diminish the risks of\\nglobalization. We must form a global alliance for human\\nsecurity. Global cooperation, as understood by the European\\nUnion, means human solidarity to ensure the survival of our\\nplanet and safeguard the future of coming generations.\\n\\n\\n', 'Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,\\non your election, which attests to the high regard in which\\nthe international community holds you and your country,\\nand which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay,\\nwelcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session\\nof the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead\\nto the strengthening of the Organization.\\nIt was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, “the\\npeoples of the United Nations”, decided to join our efforts\\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\\nwar...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\\nthe dignity and worth of the human person...to\\nestablish conditions under which justice...can be\\nmaintained, and to promote social progress”.\\nThat immense ambition was justified by the recent\\nhorrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from\\nhappening again — a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a\\nsuperhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert\\nCamus put it:\\n”Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time\\nto accomplish, that’s all.”\\nA long time has elapsed, and we are still working on\\nthat, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what\\nwe have done as the United Nations throughout these 53\\nyears, of what the Security Council and successive General\\nAssemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries-\\nGeneral — in particular the current one over the last two\\nyears, whose work has been so outstanding.\\nOver the decades, the Security Council, except when\\nparalysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed\\nto shoulder its primary responsibility for international\\nsecurity. When it failed to do so, no other institution was\\nable to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50\\nyears ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations\\nof this kind.\\nThe institutional framework established by the\\nCharter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from\\ncold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years,\\nproved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne\\nout in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when\\nthe Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in\\nAfrica, during the creation of the United Nations Mission\\nin the Central African Republic, which was the first\\nentirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and\\neven in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted\\nto the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its\\nobjective.\\nAnd yet, as the Secretary-General himself\\nemphasized recently,\\n“Unpredictability and surprise have become almost\\ncommonplace” (A/53/1, para. 1),\\nand the illusions of the end of the cold war have not\\nstood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge\\nthis fact, is not moving towards greater harmony.\\nSometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some\\nStates take advantage of circumstances and deliberately\\ncarry out archaic policies of force that contravene the\\nprinciples of the Charter. On other occasions, the\\nabdication or implosion of States has released among\\nvarious groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very\\nmuch alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these\\nare destabilizing factors which, while very different, all\\nhelp to disorganize and imperil international relations.\\nSeveral major crises have proved this recently. The\\nAsian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth,\\nwhen badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world\\nthat is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive\\nreactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid\\nspread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is\\nexchanged on the financial markets — huge sums of\\nmoney that are greater than the means of intervention of\\nall the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those\\namounts were equal to the world’s gross national product.\\nToday, they are 15 times greater.\\nThe nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic\\nreminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute\\ncombined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity\\ncould open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.\\nIn East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of\\na border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven\\nStates are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory\\n15\\n\\n\\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization\\nis threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I\\ncannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts,\\ncivil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve\\nmore than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.\\nTwenty-two million civilians — displaced persons and\\nreturnees — have been affected by these conflicts and\\nrequire assistance from the Office of the United Nations\\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active\\nin 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;\\nslavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;\\ndisappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.\\nBut I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of\\nwoe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which\\nis the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very\\nmoment trying to maintain peace on four continents with\\napproximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17\\noperations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20\\nagencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.\\nNor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in\\n1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.\\nI wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the\\nmultilateral system do not today have the necessary means\\nto meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not\\ngive up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our\\naction?\\nAllow me to make some suggestions in this area. First,\\nwe can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our\\ninstitutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security\\nCouncil a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the\\ncase of “threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and\\nacts of aggression”.\\nNothing can justify the use of force by a State, a\\ngroup of States or an organization, however powerful, if\\nprior authorization was not received from the Security\\nCouncil — except in cases of self-defence.\\nMy country shares the impatience of those who\\ndeplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution\\nto various cruel conflicts — for example, in Kosovo, where\\nthe humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November\\n1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put\\nforward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its\\nother partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground\\nfor a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for\\nthe return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible\\nuse of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to\\nforgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after\\nthis case there would be another exception, and then\\nanother. Little by little, any country would declare itself\\nentitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or\\nambitions so required, and we would have to begin all\\nover again. We must remain firm on this principle.\\nSecond, we must make sure that the authority of the\\nSecurity Council is respected and its resolutions are\\ncomplied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today\\nthe question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.\\nThe lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council’s\\nresolutions, been made subject to the controlled\\ndismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must\\ntherefore meet these conditions — completely meet them,\\nbut only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim\\nmust be to reintegrate Iraq into the international\\ncommunity, starting with the region.\\nThe only way to achieve that end is by Iraq’s\\ncomplete compliance with the relevant resolutions — all\\nthe resolutions, nothing but the resolutions — which\\nmeans Iraq’s unreserved cooperation with the United\\nNations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq’s\\ndisarmament.\\nThe third need is to increase the representativeness\\nof the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.\\nThis is why my country has come out in favour of\\nenlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand,\\nnew permanent members — two seats for the North, to\\nwhich Germany and Japan have every claim, and three\\nfor the South; on the other hand, there should be new\\nnon-permanent members for the North and South. This\\nenlargement must at the same time preserve the Council’s\\neffectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its\\nresponsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third\\nsession of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.\\nFourth, we must increase the capacity of our\\nOrganization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is\\nmuch to be done. Now that the international community\\nhas just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth\\nanniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the\\npeace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in\\nMadrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night,\\nand the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France\\ncontinues to support the persevering efforts of the United\\nStates Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left\\nwithout any prospects at all should those efforts\\nunfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac\\nand President Mubarak have proposed in that event\\nconvening a conference of countries resolved to save the\\n16\\n\\n\\npeace. This concern for the future has been very well\\nreceived. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working\\nto further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of\\nmeeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a\\njust and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and\\nagreements that have been reached.\\nAnother region in crisis calls for our attention. As I\\nmentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo six or seven African States of the\\nGreat Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle\\nof problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities,\\nethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so\\nforth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each\\nof these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a\\nregional solution. That is why my country has raised again\\nthe idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes\\nregion, which we suggested as early as 1995. The\\nconference would be placed under the aegis of the United\\nNations or the Organization of African Unity, with the\\nactive participation of the States of the region. Several\\nAfrican diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We\\nsupport those efforts.\\nAfrica is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us\\npay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General’s\\nrepresentatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of\\nMatre Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission.\\nFifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral\\ndisarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the\\nnuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone\\nrecognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime\\nand pursue the disarmament process in all areas — nuclear,\\nconventional, chemical and biological.\\nOur primary objective here should be the entry into\\nforce as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive\\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United\\nKingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the\\nTreaty and is the only one to have completed the\\ndismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that\\nhave not yet done so to accede to this Treaty — including\\nIndia and Pakistan, which have announced their intention\\nnot to carry out any more nuclear tests.\\nAnother objective here would be a treaty banning the\\nproduction of fissile material for military purposes. I\\nproposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of\\nthe Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we\\nshould launch such a negotiation. A universal, non-\\ndiscriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give\\nnew impetus to disarmament.\\nWe should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of\\nchemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the\\nConvention banning chemical weapons becomes universal\\nand that the Convention banning biological weapons is\\nmade truly effective through a verification mechanism.\\nCombating the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles\\ncapable of delivering such weapons, while preserving\\nuseful civilian applications.\\nIn order to make progress in conventional\\ndisarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention\\nproviding for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel\\nmines comes into force as soon as possible.\\nSixth, we should continue to combat\\nunderdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no\\nfurther demonstration. France remains heavily committed;\\nit is the second largest provider of official development\\nassistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more\\neffective, France has decided to reform its cooperation\\narrangements and increase coordination with other donors\\n— in the first place with the European Union. More than\\n60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European\\nUnion. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin\\nAmerica and the second largest to Asia.\\nFrance would like development resources to be more\\npredictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals\\nthat we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the\\nidea of a development account. We encourage the United\\nNations to continue its discussions in this area.\\nSeventh, we need to work with the non-\\ngovernmental organizations. They are capable of sounding\\nthe alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very\\npractical terms to help build States governed by the rule\\nof law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the\\nactivities of Mrs. Robinson, United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission\\non Human Rights and in the various United Nations\\nagencies, which must also — all of them — integrate the\\nhuman rights dimension into their activities.\\nAfter more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will\\nsee the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of\\nhuman rights. This is a crucial text because these are the\\nrights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.\\n17\\n\\n\\nHowever, even if we reinforce the Security Council,\\nstrengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better\\nhandle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this\\nwill still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and\\nfor that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide\\nregulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.\\nThe eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in\\nall its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International\\nCriminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive\\nnegotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against\\nthe impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of\\nthe first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential\\nsynthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and\\nstrikes a balance between the Court’s competences and the\\npowers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the\\nspirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those\\ncountries that still have reservations will be able to join us.\\nIn another field of law, the International Labour\\nOrganization has taken a historic step towards universal\\ncompliance with basic labour standards through the\\ndeclaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is\\na commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the\\nOrganization.\\nOn 11 November 1997 the United Nations\\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted\\nthe Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and\\nHuman Rights. This is the first normative framework to\\nguide the international community in an area of scientific\\nresearch where advances are already shaking our traditional\\nconcepts of life and social organization. France is\\nsubmitting a draft resolution calling on the General\\nAssembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.\\nNinth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of\\norganized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of\\nillegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion — 8\\nper cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the\\nInternational Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations\\nrepresent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross\\ndomestic product.\\nAt the special session in New York in June we\\ndecided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for\\ndrugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let\\nus do so.\\nTenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms,\\nwhoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.\\nThe recent International Convention for the\\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step\\nforward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the\\nmeans to hunt down those who finance and instigate these\\nattacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal\\nconvention against the financing of terrorism.\\nWe need to define concrete mechanisms for legal\\nmeasures and mutual judicial assistance against those who\\nfinance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure\\nor the freezing of the assets of organizations or\\nindividuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be\\nprovided for. Innovative measures, such as making it\\nimpossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies\\ninvestigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we\\nhave the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at\\nthe end of the present session of the General Assembly.\\nPresident Clinton spoke here on Monday of this\\ncommon struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.\\nIn addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that\\nbreed terrorism.\\nThe eleventh point I would like to make concerns\\nthe remedy for not only the current financial crises, but\\nalso the malfunctioning of the international financial\\nsystem as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the\\nincreasing calls for a “new Bretton Woods”. Financial\\nglobalization is running wild now. New means urgently\\nneed to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to\\nmake its contribution. We need also to define new rules\\nadapted to today’s financial realities. My country is today\\npresenting to its European partners some proposals to\\ncounter international financial instability.\\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) must\\nnaturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be\\nmore legitimate and more effective, working on the basis\\nof clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines,\\ncooperating with other competent bodies, organizing\\ndialogue between industrialized countries and emerging\\ncountries, ensuring the transparency of the financial\\nsystem and reflecting the economic, social and political\\nrealities of partner countries — an IMF that can detect\\nearly warning signs to prevent crises from happening.\\nWithin this transformation, to which the Director-\\nGeneral of the IMF is making an important contribution,\\nand also in order better to stabilize the international\\neconomic and monetary situation and to support world\\ngrowth, Europe will play an increasingly important role\\n18\\n\\n\\nsince it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency,\\nthe euro, and we are anticipating the benefits.\\nFrom this period we are living through, which is so\\nfull of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and\\nof crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular\\nthose made under the aegis of the United Nations,\\nadditional progress must be forthcoming in building a more\\njust and more peaceful world, because this is what we all\\nwant.\\nToday’s world needs rules. The United Nations must\\nremain the unifying framework, and the Charter must\\nremain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its\\nworth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of\\nregulation — these are three main areas for our work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'I would first like to congratulate our colleague,\\nthe Uruguayan Minister Didier Opertti, on his election to\\nthe presidency of our General Assembly.\\nI would also like to associate myself with the\\nstatement made by our colleague, Mr. Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel,\\nwho spoke on behalf of the European Union. My country\\nshares and supports entirely the concerns and objectives\\nhe outlined.\\nUnprecedented crises over the last few months have\\nshaken our economies and the economies of the entire\\nregion. To varying degrees, the economies of the world\\nhave all sustained the social and political consequences of\\ninterdependence and the information systems that link\\nthem. It therefore seems to me that the time has come to\\nrethink seriously the way in which international\\ninstitutions and national Governments deal with the\\ntensions and constraints which result from globalization.\\nThis means specifically that we must reflect upon\\nthe quality of life humankind will have in the next\\ncentury. Despite worrisome forecasts, we seem unable to\\ncome up with a list of priorities which reflects the global\\npublic interest. We must establish a common frame of\\nreference that ensures the peaceful coexistence of States\\nand their citizens while at the same time respecting their\\ndiversity. This task is the indispensable corollary of\\nglobalization, which has numerous ramifications for\\ncurrent problems. The international communityâs\\nresponses have therefore been flawed and partial and\\nsubject to corporate logic and a narrow view of the\\nissues.\\nThe limitations of these responses are well known to\\nus. Countless children died last year from diseases which\\ncould have been eradicated. Tropical forests covering an\\narea equivalent to three times the size of Belgium\\n21\\n\\n\\ndisappeared. The developing worldâs debt remains\\nuntenably large, while expenditures for weapons continues\\nto grow. Incalculable numbers of people have been\\ndetained, tortured, killed or forced to flee their countries.\\nHundreds of innocent victims have lost their lives in\\nterrorist attacks.\\nGlobal information networks and new technologies\\nreduce distances. Thanks to television, more than one\\nbillion people can today discover both manâs incredible\\ninventions and the worst abuses he is capable of. This is a\\nscenario which touches our conscience.\\nTodayâs crises affect the entire global system and call\\nfor solutions on the same level. The only way to respond\\neffectively is to give a greater role to international solidarity\\nand social justice. Those are the two pillars of the new\\ninternational ethic that I would like to call for today. This\\nis not a simple task. No Government likes to limit its room\\nto manoeuvre, even for just causes, if it is the only one\\npaying the price for its commitments.\\nI am nevertheless convinced that the United Nations\\nis the best forum to have a debate on this matter of\\ninternational public interest. It is here, and nowhere else,\\nthat we can draw up universally accepted norms that have\\nthe approval of the largest possible number of States. The\\nOrganization can help us strengthen international consensus\\nand the acceptance of codes of conduct designed to set the\\nboundaries of human dignity and peaceful coexistence.\\nEconomic and financial power dominates the world,\\nbut the last few months have shown that it is not capable of\\nrunning it. The globalization of political life and civil\\nsociety leads us to attempt to reach beyond national\\nlimitations to confront our problems. Liberalization has\\ngenerated significant growth in trade and investments. It has\\nalso led to increased transparency between our different\\nsocial systems. This transparency obliges us more than in\\nthe past to reflect upon our concepts of the rights of the\\nindividual and the need to defend them.\\nHowever, access to the global economic village has\\nnot led to a concomitant strengthening of solidarity. The\\ncapacity of men and women to adapt has been severely put\\nto the test. The grip of the logic of the marketplace on the\\nindividual seems to relegate him to a secondary role in the\\ninternational system. Our societies should henceforth\\nreconcile the often very divergent effects that globalization\\nhas on the individual and on the State â€” namely,\\nunemployment, competition and financial speculation. The\\nbalance between the freedom of some and the rights of\\nothers is all too often disturbed. Marginalization and\\nabject poverty are reappearing, thereby threatening the\\nexercise of the most fundamental of rights. After the\\n1980s â€” a lost decade, from the point of view of\\ndevelopment â€” the decade of structural adjustments has\\nbeen unable to put economies back on the road to\\nsustainable development. Differences in income, both at\\nthe level of society and at the global level, have been\\naccentuated. What can we do? What must we do?\\nThe Internet and the financial markets by themselves\\ncannot hold the international community together. We\\nknow that Governments alone are incapable of dealing\\nwith the problems with which they are confronted. This\\nis why new forms of solidarity and new ways of dealing\\nwith these issues are indispensable. Only a strong political\\ninternational organization can counterbalance the forces of\\nthe financial markets. The loss of power of nation-States\\nover financial and economic decisions is glaring; the\\nsocial consequences are even more so. This does not call\\ninto question the existing consensus on the validity of\\ncontrolled liberalization of trade, but it does put all\\nGovernments up against the wall. Has the time not come\\nfor some sort of regulation that benefits everyone?\\nIndeed, liberalization cannot be an end in itself. It\\nhas no purpose if it does not contribute to social progress\\nfor the largest possible number of people. We should\\ntherefore strive together to find concerted responses to the\\nuncontrolled and painful effects of this evolution by\\nstrengthening public control throughout the world. In this\\nregard some have proposed an economic security council.\\nThis is obviously an ambitious idea, but it does serve to\\nshow how serious the threat of financial instability and\\neconomic uncertainty is to our societies. In any case, an\\nintensified dialogue between the United Nations and the\\nBretton Woods institutions must be instituted as a first\\nstep.\\nOf course, regional strategies have been developed\\nto strengthen economic convergence in certain regions\\nand to integrate them into zones. Nevertheless, these\\nregional strategies should respect the rules of\\nmultilateralism. Efficient partnerships based on mutual\\ntrade have to be developed with other regions without\\nmarginalizing third States. Developing countries must be\\nintegrated in commerce and enjoy the fruits of market\\nliberalization. In this respect, my country supports the\\nefforts placed on record by the European Union in the\\nspirit referred to as â€œfair tradeâ€\\x9d.\\n22\\n\\n\\nI would now like to say a few words about the United\\nNations, which is at the centre of all these interactions. I\\nsay to you, the representatives of the 185 nations committed\\nto the pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations, that\\nwe have all too often forgotten our obligations under the\\nCharter. Now that we are free of the shackles of the cold\\nwar and its ideological deadlocks, the obligation to\\nstrengthen cohesion between States and to promote social\\njustice is more than ever the real order of business.\\nIn this respect, I support the proposal to devote the\\nMillennium Assembly to the issue of the fight against\\npoverty. The gaze of much of the world will be turned\\ntowards the United Nations at that time. It would be a\\nterrible failure if on that occasion we were only able to\\nrefer poverty to various committees, soothing our\\nconscience with meetings of fleeting significance. As the\\nSecretary-General stresses in his report, the fight against\\npoverty starts with good governance. Political\\ndemocratization and mechanisms for revenue sharing are\\nindispensable elements.\\nThe question of Central Africa is currently of\\nparticular importance for Africa. After hopes were raised\\nfor what some wanted to call an African renaissance, the\\ncontinent has again become prey to violence that is\\nbecoming dangerously ethnic in character. Once again, the\\nprincipal victims are among the most vulnerable people in\\nthe world.\\nThe crisis in the Great Lakes region is a moral\\nchallenge for the United Nations. It imposes on us the duty\\nof solidarity. We must help Africa to find solutions and to\\nimplement them without interfering or trying to impose\\nsolutions. The United Nations, together with the relevant\\nregional and subregional organizations, should involve itself\\nin an initiative to restore dialogue to the region and to put\\nconfidence-building measures in place. I believe that a\\nconference on regional security and cooperation in the\\nGreat Lakes region â€” if it is viewed as a process rather\\nthan as a single event â€” could serve as the vehicle for\\nstabilizing the region. My country is willing to support such\\nan initiative.\\nPolitical instability, uninterrupted violence and\\nchallenges to the nation State have led to large-scale\\npopulation movements. In Central Africa, Kosovo and\\nelsewhere, hundreds of thousands of families have been\\nforced to flee their homes and their land. It is our shared\\nduty to continue to assist humanitarian organizations in\\ntheir efforts to come to the aid of these refugees and to\\nenable them to return home. However, sometimes, when the\\nroads or the family land are littered with landmines and\\nchildren cannot go to school without being exposed to\\nphysical danger, returning can be a problem. We must rid\\nourselves of these landmines; their production must stop.\\nThese devices of death must be for ever banished from\\nthe Earth.\\nI welcome the entry into force of the Convention on\\nthe total prohibition of anti-personnel landmines and\\nappeal to donor and victim countries to support the\\nintegrated activities undertaken by the United Nations in\\nthis field, including through voluntary financial\\ncontributions.\\nBut that is not enough. Conflict prevention should be\\na priority, and within our Organization we must also pay\\nattention to the less spectacular aspects of conflict\\nprevention, such as early warning and the establishment\\nof an appropriate United Nations presence on the ground.\\nConflict prevention will make no sense if we do not\\nat the same time put an end to the acquisition of arms by\\nthose who attempt to resolve their problems through\\nviolence. Belgium has responded positively to the\\nEuropean Union initiative to formulate a code of conduct\\nfor arms transactions. My country is also a strong\\nadvocate of giving the United Nations Register of\\nConventional Arms effective universal application. It is\\nalso behind several initiatives designed to block the illegal\\ntransfer of small arms. The Brussels conference, which\\nwill take place in October, and our participation on the\\nPanel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms, provide\\nfurther examples of our commitment, which extends to all\\nsectors of disarmament. How could it be otherwise, when\\nsome countries consider it useful to put on an alarming\\nshow of their nuclear expertise?\\nA significant contribution to ethical renewal in\\ninternational relations was the adoption, after much work,\\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It is\\nindeed shocking that those responsible for the most\\nreprehensible crimes, in particular genocide, can go\\nunpunished. Belgium has recently signed the Statute of\\nthe International Criminal Court and intends to work for\\nits effective establishment. My country will also continue\\nto support the two existing United Nations ad hoc\\ncriminal tribunals. Some countries still harbour doubts\\nabout that important undertaking. However, a balance has\\nbeen found between international security and justice. The\\nonly remaining question is whether we, so-called civilized\\nnations, are prepared to adopt binding rules so as to\\nensure respect for the most elementary and universally\\n23\\n\\n\\naccepted principles of respect for the human being and\\ninternational coexistence. Adopting voluntary restrictions to\\nstrengthen an international ethical code can only benefit\\nStates and their citizens. That is truly the role of the State:\\nto ensure that its citizens are protected â€” if necessary,\\nthrough international law.\\nI do not consider it realistic to develop a global ethical\\ncode without working for the protection and education of\\nour children. Working together with other countries, the\\nUnited Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF) and other\\nUnited Nations organizations, Belgium has played an\\nimportant role in a number of initiatives. I propose that the\\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session build upon its\\nachievements with respect to the definition of standards for\\nthe protection of children. Child labour is a waste of human\\nbeings â€” for the girls and boys who are subjected to it and\\nfor future generations. Market forces must yield in this\\narea. Like the enlistment of child soldiers, child labour is a\\nmoral scandal that must be remedied through the\\ndevelopment of alternatives adapted to the sociocultural\\ncontext at the local level.\\nOne of my Governmentâs priorities is the fight against\\nthe most repugnant forms of exploitation. We are alarmed\\nby the use of the Internet by those who traffic in children\\nand by networks of prostitutes and all the new forms of\\ncrime that make a mockery of traditional methods of\\ndefending the rule of law. Here, too, international\\ncooperation is the only solution.\\nI am also ready to take the initiative, on the occasion\\nof the tenth anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of\\nthe Child in 1999, to organize, together with UNICEF and\\nall interested countries, a meeting in Belgium at which we\\ncan all share our experiences with regard to our respective\\nlegislation.\\nThe ideas that I have outlined will be not bear fruit if\\nMember States do not cooperate fully with the\\nOrganization. Denying the Secretary-General the resources\\nneeded to turn the United Nations into an efficient\\ninstrument will only make matters worse. The Secretary-\\nGeneral deserves our full support in his reform efforts.\\nThe Security Council is crucial for the maintenance of\\ninternational peace and security. Its reform is of concern to\\nus all. I hope that in the not-too-distant future, a balanced\\nenlargement of the Council can be agreed upon. The work\\nundertaken during the past year has sometimes been\\ndisappointing because of the stubborn resistance of several\\ncountries. Belgium belongs to the majority of Member\\nStates arguing for a strengthening of the authority of the\\nCouncil. My country clearly laid out its position: we\\nwould like an equal increase in the number of permanent\\nand non-permanent members, better representation of the\\nvarious regions and self-imposed limits on the use of the\\nright of veto under certain conditions provided for in\\nadvance. The privilege of veto is excessive when it is\\nused to the detriment of the interests of the international\\ncommunity as whole.\\nThe consensus proposal put forward by the group of\\n10 has numerous advantages and offers material for\\nfurther reflection. It is quite disturbing to see that a\\nminority of Member States are ignoring the evolution of\\ninternational relations over the last 50 years while at the\\nsame time claiming for themselves a preponderant role in\\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\\nPostponing reform of the Security Council is tantamount\\nto an assault on its credibility.\\nThe financial health of the Organization has not\\nimproved much over the course of the last year. Belgium\\nbelieves that countries that accumulate arrears harm the\\nentire international community. The damage goes beyond\\nthe resulting debt, because the Organization is denied the\\nmeans fully to discharge its mandate. Furthermore, the\\nreform process is jeopardized. Nothing can make up for\\nthe damage this does to international cooperation and\\nsocial progress. The political and moral responsibility of\\nthose Governments is at stake. None who speak from this\\nrostrum can claim their attachment to United Nations\\nideals without accepting the financial obligations involved\\nin being a Member, that is, payment in full, on time and\\nwithout conditions of their financial contributions.\\nIn face of the excesses of the international system,\\nthe international community must be on guard. Here as\\nwell our Organization can be the worldâs conscience. Its\\nweighty role is to help Member States formulate adequate\\nresponses to the globalization with which we are\\nconfronted. It is therefore in a serious yet hopeful frame\\nof mind that I look at the agenda of this session of the\\nGeneral Assembly and pledge my countryâs full support\\nfor the work ahead of us.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'As previous speakers have done, I would like to\\nconvey to the President my sincerest congratulations on\\nhis election to the presidency at the fifty-third session of\\nthe General Assembly. I am convinced that our Assembly\\nwill benefit greatly from his sense of authority and\\nleadership. I also wish to express my gratitude to his\\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his\\ncommitment and perseverance in conducting our work\\nduring the fifty-second session.\\nThe Secretary-General of our Organization is\\ndevoting tireless energy to opening up new avenues for\\nour common efforts. He has emphasized the crucial\\nimportance of good communications to ensure that the\\nUnited Nations will be a catalyst both for those directly\\ninvolved in international life and for our peoples. We\\nshare that belief with him and encourage him in that\\nrespect.\\nLast Tuesday, members heard the statement of\\nMr. Schüssel, President of the Council of the European\\nUnion. He spoke on behalf of all of the countries of the\\nEuropean Union, and Luxembourg fully supports the\\nviews expressed.\\n19\\n\\n\\nThe presence of representatives of 185 States in this\\nHall reflects our common concern to ensure balance and\\nsecurity among nations, but also within our societies. Our\\nconcern is to ensure the permanence of values to which we\\nare all committed in an ever-evolving world. In the context\\nof its mandate to preserve international peace and security,\\nour Organization regularly asks whether it has the means to\\nensure that the general interest, as perceived by our\\ncitizens, prevails. Surely, we must not be overly ambitious.\\nWe are aware of the complexity and the magnitude of the\\nsituations we face, and that these impose limits on our\\naction. Therefore we must focus our operations and provide\\nan appropriate framework for them. It is also our duty to\\nacquire the means to act effectively whenever our\\nineffectiveness or slow response would seem to negatively\\naffect the weakest among us.\\nLuxembourg supports the efforts under way to provide\\nour Organization with permanent structures and to make\\navailable to it forces prepared for rapid and effective\\nintervention whenever the Security Council, guarantor of\\nthe preservation of peace and security, deems it necessary.\\nOur common efforts to make our world safer suffered\\na serious setback following the nuclear tests recently carried\\nout by two major countries in South Asia. We noted with\\nsatisfaction that the representatives of India and Pakistan\\nhave just announced from this rostrum that their countries\\nare prepared to join the international community by\\nacceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\\nWe invite them to proceed in that direction as quickly as\\npossible.\\nWill these efforts appear absurd, given the endless\\npursuit of the tragic discussion about the disarmament of\\nIraq? This spring the Security Council endorsed the\\nmemorandum of understanding submitted to it following the\\nSecretary-General?s visit to Baghdad. Since then, such\\ncooperation has been called into question. Such abrupt\\nchanges generate concern and discouragement and call into\\nquestion the credibility of our Organization. It is the\\nSecurity Council?s responsibility to take the necessary steps\\nto ensure that its decisions in this area are fully respected.\\nOur Organization is pursuing conflict prevention and\\npeacekeeping. At the recent meeting between the United\\nNations and the representatives of regional organizations,\\nthe proposal for development of a culture of prevention was\\nput forward. Progress has been made in the concept of\\nmutually supportive institutions and on support for the\\ninitiatives taken at the regional and subregional level.\\nWhile it is desirable to support such initiatives and\\nefforts, we must remember that the Charter confers\\nprinciple responsibility for the maintenance of\\ninternational peace and security on the Security Council\\nand that the Council must fully play its role. We welcome\\nthe fact that in 1998 the Council once again authorized\\ntwo peacekeeping operations, one in Sierra Leone and the\\nother in the Central African Republic.\\nThe Ottowa conference on the prohibition of anti-\\npersonnel mines was undeniably an invigorating success\\nin an area which constantly creates innocent victims. This\\ntreaty, which has just entered into force, will make it\\npossible to save many human lives. The news that anti-\\npersonnel mines are again being sown in Angola and\\nalong the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\nis terrifying. Such action, if confirmed, must be\\ncondemned vigorously.\\nIn Kosovo, the violence directed against the civilian\\npopulation must end. It proves that the Federal Republic\\nof Yugoslavia continues to follow paths which cannot but\\ncompromise progress in its integration into international\\nand European structures. Armed action conducted by\\nAlbanian groups in Kosovo must also end. The scorn for\\nhuman suffering displayed by the Serbian leaders and the\\nextremists in Kosovo is incomprehensible.\\nA new status for Kosovo must emerge. It is\\ninconceivable that such a status can emerge under the\\nsway of threat or, even worse, cold-hearted implacable\\nviolence, which would merely drive the wedge deeper to\\nthe point where the very idea of understanding would be\\nabsurd. As Security Council resolution 1199 (1998)\\nrequires, a political solution must be negotiated between\\nthe parties under the aegis of the international community.\\nFirm cohesion between Europe, the United States and the\\nRussian Federation should enable those in the region, as\\nwas the case previously, to address their future in a more\\nrational and orderly way.\\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the extremist tendencies\\nare on the decline. This political progress was rapidly\\nreflected in concrete results achieved in the field, and\\ntoday this war-torn country is engaged in reconstruction.\\nIt is comforting to note that a growing number of\\nindividuals charged with war crimes have been sent to the\\nTribunal at The Hague. The establishment and the\\n20\\n\\n\\nfunctioning of the structures decided on in the context of\\nthe peace process are today becoming a reality.\\nThe recent elections have confirmed this new realism.\\nIt is up to the international community to consolidate this\\ntrend, as it still appears to be fragile, and to ensure, in\\nparticular, the return of refugees and displaced persons.\\nThis latter question is particularly acute in Croatia and\\nAlbania.\\nAnother key element for opening the way to a brighter\\nfuture is a firm, unequivocal commitment by the regional\\nparties and the international community. I refer to the peace\\nprocess in the Middle East. Five years after the Oslo\\nagreements, we must note the stagnation of the peace\\nprocess, whose logic — the principle of land for peace —\\nthe current Israeli Government never really accepted.\\nThe archaic and paralysing philosophy of refusal has\\nunfortunately returned to the foreground; it is reflected in\\nmany initiatives which only increase tension, thus nullifying\\nthe efforts of those who advocate peace. The political\\nleaders involved must reverse this trend so as to return to\\nthe good faith implementation of all the provisions of the\\nOslo agreements.\\nOur action, in that region and in others, must focus on\\nconvincing the parties involved that there is no alternative\\nto peace.\\nIt is regrettable that this central concept is also being\\ncalled into question in a number of African regions. Tribal\\nrivalries and resentments continue to supplant\\nclearsightedness and the desire for good governance. In no\\ncase should the political leaders involved in the different\\nflashpoints feel that their only choice is between submitting\\nto events and shirking their responsibilities.\\nThe struggles for influence and the war in and around\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo are on the verge of\\ndegenerating into a regional conflict and bringing about a\\nhumanitarian catastrophe there too.\\nThe causes of conflicts and the promotion of peace\\nand sustainable development in Africa call for a united\\nresponse. The debate at ministerial level that the Security\\nCouncil has just held on these topics was very helpful. The\\nGeneral Assembly will have occasion to consider this\\nquestion over the course of its fifty-third session, with a\\nview to a discussion on possible measures. While the future\\nof Africa depends first of all on the efforts of Africans\\nthemselves, the international community must be actively\\ninvolved in order to ensure respect for international law,\\nand in order to carry out its duty of solidarity.\\nRecent events, with the terrible bombings perpetrated\\nin Africa and Northern Ireland, remind us once again of\\nthe intolerable nature of terrorism. It is up to the\\ninternational community to acquire an effective means of\\ncombating this scourge on an international level, and to\\nensure that the perpetrators of such acts answer for their\\ncrimes before the competent courts. We owe it to\\nourselves to put a definitive end to the culture of\\nimpunity in connection with terrorism.\\nAnother priority for our General Assembly is reform\\nof the Organization. We welcome the fact that some\\nprogress was made during the fifty-second session. But\\nreform cannot be an isolated event; it must become a\\nprocess that underlies all of our action. We pledge to\\ncontinue actively supporting the efforts of the Secretary-\\nGeneral, and to add our efforts to his, with a view to\\ngiving the United Nations the capacity to respond in a\\nflexible and evolving way to the challenges of the twenty-\\nfirst century.\\nAny in-depth reform of the system will remain\\nfragile so long as the Organization lacks sound and\\nreliable financial resources. The grave financial crisis\\nwhich the Organization has experienced for a number of\\nyears must be considered as a threat to the effectiveness\\nof the whole. Our proposed reforms will be consolidated\\nonly when all Member States have agreed fully to meet\\ntheir obligations under the Charter by paying their arrears\\nto the United Nations, and by paying on time and\\nunconditionally the full amount of their obligatory\\ncontributions, both to the Organization?s regular budget\\nand to the peacekeeping budget.\\nThe maintenance of security and peace in the world\\ncannot be dissociated from the international community?s\\nefforts on behalf of development.\\nWhen we see entire regions, even subcontinents,\\nexperiencing poverty and malnutrition, there is a shocking\\nimbalance which will soon pose a threat to the security of\\nthe States concerned and to respect for the fundamental\\nrights of the human individual.\\nWhen we see that generations of young people can\\nhope for no future but unemployment or a frustrating\\ninactivity, there exists a flagrant and unjust imbalance\\nwhich will be a source of conflict.\\n21\\n\\n\\nWhen we see social categories permanently deprived\\nof education and health care, that, too, is an imbalance to\\nwhich we cannot be indifferent.\\nThe economic, financial and social crisis currently\\nbesetting South-East Asia, Latin America and Russia has\\nexacerbated this trend. Rationally, the international\\ncommunity must acknowledge that the means of\\nintervention traditionally, and almost mechanically,\\nemployed to overcome economic crises have proved\\nineffective this time.\\nIn his work Civilisation matérielle, économie et\\ncapitalisme, Fernand Braudel pointed out the profound\\nsource of this crisis:\\n“the emergence of a savage capitalism, as distinct\\nfrom what we consider to be a market economy”.\\nA market economy, and particularly a social market\\neconomy, cannot do without a stable State capable of\\nregulating competition and protecting the weak.\\nThe strengthening or restoration of a democratic,\\nworking State in the countries in crisis seems to me to be\\nan absolute priority.\\nThe international community cannot shirk the\\nobligation to shoulder its responsibilities and lend a strong\\nhand. It will do this not only because of its duty of\\nsolidarity, but because the interests of one and all are\\nlinked.\\nAnother area in which the interdependence of our\\nobjectives is particularly visible and tangible is that of the\\nmanagement of the world?s natural resources. It is clear that\\nwe need to be ambitious when it comes to the long-term\\nmanagement of our environment.\\nLast year we met here in special session to undertake\\nan initial evaluation of the implementation of the\\ncommitments undertaken at the Conference on Environment\\nand Development a little over six years ago. At Rio de\\nJaneiro and during last year?s evaluation session we defined\\nthe concept of a world partnership for sustainable\\ndevelopment, a partnership respecting the fact that the\\nprotection of the environment cannot be dissociated from\\nthe economic and social development process.\\nUndeniable progress has been made in recent years:\\nthe entry into force of the Framework Convention on\\nClimate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity\\nand the Convention to Combat Desertification. But it must\\nbe acknowledged that the world environment has\\ncontinued to deteriorate.\\nAccordingly, it is essential to accelerate the\\nimplementation of Agenda 21, the programme of action\\nadopted in Rio de Janeiro.\\nLuxembourg intends to shoulder its share of this\\nresponsibility. Accordingly, we have undertaken, in the\\ncontext of the commitments made by the European Union\\nat the Kyoto Conference, to reduce our emissions of six\\ngreenhouse gases to 28 per cent below 1990 levels by the\\nyear 2012.\\nIn the context of the Biodiversity Convention, we\\nalso plan to establish a national network of protected\\nareas covering 10 per cent of our national territory.\\nThe goal of managing the world?s material resources\\nas a good parent would reflect an atavistic concern, that\\nof guaranteeing security through careful preparation for\\nthe future, in particular through suitable education.\\nThe recent Lisbon Conference devoted to the\\nproblems faced by young people rightly emphasized the\\nneed to provide training that is suited to the job market so\\nas to prevent unemployment and marginalization. Such\\ntraining must include education about responsibility. We\\ntherefore welcome the fact that the Lisbon Declaration\\ncommits Governments to ensuring the participation of\\nyoung people in programmes that concern them. In that\\nway we can come closer to democratic civic education\\nbased on the rights and responsibilities of citizens and on\\nthe participation of young people in civil society.\\nLuxembourg has undertaken a long-term effort to\\nmake its own contribution to providing funds for\\ndevelopment. Our efforts are aimed at attaining the target\\nset by the United Nations of 0.7 per cent of gross national\\nproduct for official development assistance before the end\\nof the millennium. Our efforts occupy an important place\\nin the struggle against poverty, which is one of the main\\nobstacles to development. At present our contribution is\\n0.56 per cent of gross national product and is equivalent\\nto official development assistance of $195 per capita.\\nAccording to those criteria, Luxembourg is fifth among\\ndonor countries in the Development Assistance\\nCommittee.\\nFifty years ago our Organization adopted the\\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. For the first\\n22\\n\\n\\ntime, a universal organization declared its determination to\\nplace respect for human rights at the heart of international\\nrelations. Since then, we have made considerable progress\\ntowards ensuring recognition for the universal value of such\\nrights and their effective enjoyment.\\nSeveral international instruments have been added to\\nthe Universal Declaration so as to focus more precisely on\\nwhat human rights represent and to ensure that the citizens\\nof all countries of the world effectively enjoy these rights.\\nOur Organization has established the post of High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights, and concern for human\\nrights now underlies all of its activities. This progress leads\\nus to believe that human rights will find the central and\\npermanent home at the heart of international life that they\\ndeserve.\\nWe also note that the Criminal Tribunals established\\nby the United Nations to bring to trial those accused of\\ncrimes committed during recent wars in the former\\nYugoslavia and Rwanda have recently been able to\\nstrengthen their authority and the scope of their action. This\\naffirmation of their importance played a considerable role\\nin the preparation of the Statute of the International\\nCriminal Court. I sincerely welcome the positive conclusion\\nof the work of the recent Rome Conference. At the same\\ntime, I should like to emphasize the fact that the entire\\ninternational community has given that new institution\\nstrong and constant support.\\nThe end of the culture of impunity represents a\\ndecisive turning point in international relations at the end of\\nthis century. But this turning point will be convincing only\\nif the Members of our Organization display a commitment\\nto provide the new Court with the necessary credibility.\\nIn this commemorative year, we must ensure that our\\nachievements are assessed in depth and that we avoid\\ncomplacency in the field of human rights. Only in this way\\nwill it be possible to expand the base on which we can\\nbuild the values that the international community has so\\noften said it is prepared to ensure for humankind as a\\nwhole.\\nI am confident that the United Nations will remain\\ncapable of steadfastly pursuing the attainment of the great\\nobjectives it has set itself: to serve men and women, ensure\\nrespect for their rights, preserve them from the scourge of\\nwar and lead them towards development and fulfilment.\\nLuxembourg?s support will certainly not be lacking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'I congratulate\\nyou, Mr. President, on your election. I wish you good\\nfortune and all of us a successful session.\\nI should also like to thank Ambassador Udovenko for\\nthe dedicated way he conducted the business of the fifty-\\nsecond session. He advanced the reform process at the\\nUnited Nations and kept it on the agenda. We can and must\\nfollow up these efforts.\\nThis session of the General Assembly has a special\\nsignificance for my country. It was 25 years ago, almost to\\nthe day, on 19 September 1973, that Walter Scheel became\\nthe first Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of\\nGermany to address the United Nations. When he described\\nour perception of the United Nations, he said that it meant\\nmore than the mere security of States, more than the mere\\nregulation of their diplomatic relations. He said that what\\nit is all about is the beginning and the objective of any\\nrational policy â€” people.\\nThat description of our role in the United Nations\\nremains valid. United Germany too feels committed to a\\nworld free from fear and want, protected by the rule of law,\\na world in which every individual has his opportunity and\\nwhich preserves the integrity of Creation for future\\ngenerations. It is the vision enshrined in the International\\nBill of Human Rights.\\nWe have come a lot closer to that vision over the past\\n25 years. The division of Germany, Europe and the world\\nhas been healed. The world is developing ever more into\\nthe \"one world\" on the foundations of democracy and\\nhuman rights. But it is also becoming increasingly clear that\\nthe human race has never been so bound up together in its\\ncommon destiny, united by common challenges, as it is\\ntoday.\\nThe crises in Russia and Asia have shaken the world\\neconomy. The global scourges of drugs, organized crime\\nand terrorism spread their tentacles around the globe. The\\nyear 1998 is the year of climate disasters. Two thirds of\\nBangladesh is under water and the Yangtze floods in\\nChina have claimed thousands of lives.\\nNo State, whether super-Power or small island State,\\ncan master these global challenges alone. And no one can\\nescape them, least of all the suffering people: the\\nhomeless in Bangladesh, the drug addict in Europe, the\\nvictim of civil war in Africa.\\nWe can shape our future only through joint efforts.\\nWe therefore need global action and global management\\nfor the global challenges of the twenty-first century; not\\ntomorrow or the day after, but today.\\nThis is a test not only for Governments but also for\\nthe other global players: the non-governmental\\norganizations and the multinational corporations. Never\\nwere the non-governmental organizations so important as\\nthey are today. Without them the Ottawa Convention\\nbanning landmines could not have been signed in\\nDecember 1997. And, let us not forget, 51 of the world\\'s\\nhundred largest economic entities are now companies, and\\nonly 49 of them States. All this shows that the time has\\ncome for new alliances for peace, freedom and prosperity\\nthroughout the world.\\nThe age of globalization is the age of the United\\nNations. Only here do all nations of the world come\\ntogether. Only here can we find joint solutions to the\\nglobal challenges of today and tomorrow. This is why we\\nGermans want to help get the United Nations in shape for\\nthe twenty-first century. We are facing up to this\\nresponsibility - as the second largest export nation and\\nthe third largest economy in the world, and as the country\\nwith the largest population in the European Union.\\nWe owe Secretary-General Kofi Annan our gratitude\\nand support for his reform proposals. Now it is up to the\\nMember States. The Security Council still mirrors the\\nworld as it was at the end of the Second World War, but\\nnot the enhanced status of Asia, Africa and Latin America\\nwith the Caribbean.\\nThe same is true of the greater weight of Japan and\\nunited Germany. I wish to thank all Member States that\\nadvocate a permanent seat for Germany on the Security\\nCouncil. Security Council reform cannot be delayed any\\nlonger; otherwise, the momentum will be lost and that\\nwould be bad indeed.\\nSince the ending of the cold war the United Nations\\nhas had more burdens to shoulder than ever. It therefore\\nneeds effective institutions, and for this reason it has a right\\nto expect members to pay their dues on time. All, and\\nespecially the big members, must help according to their\\nability to ensure that the world Organization can accomplish\\nits tasks. Germany, the third largest contributor, will\\ncontinue to meet its obligations.\\nWe know from recent experience that we should not\\nadd to but rather ease the burden of the United Nations.\\nThis is a task especially for regional organizations like the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\\n(OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). If\\nthey succeed in settling conflicts locally, the Security\\nCouncil will not need to deal with them. I think that would\\nbe very well-advised, because it would free capacities for\\nall of us.\\nNew avenues of joint action are therefore called for.\\nTo pretend globalization is not happening would be absurd.\\nOnly those who face up to the challenge can exploit the\\nopportunities and cushion the risks.\\nThe impact of the crises in Russia and Asia shows that\\nthe world economy needs a reliable framework. That is not\\nto say we need a global financial authority or fixed\\nexchange rates, least of all a new wave of protectionism.\\nBut we do need better early-warning mechanisms, more\\ntransparency and more efficient banking systems, especially\\nin the newly emerging economies.\\nThis is not a task for Governments alone. What is\\nneeded now is a global public-private partnership between\\nGovernments, international financial organizations and\\ncorporations. We therefore support the American initiative\\nfor a dialogue between the G-8 and the newly emerging\\neconomies on a new international financial architecture. The\\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank\\nshould not always have to serve as the stopgap when the\\nopportunity for structural reforms has been missed.\\nManaging globalization also means weaving a network\\nof partnerships between the big regional groupings and the\\nbig countries. The regional groupings are the components\\nof a new global order under the roof of the United Nations.\\nThe European Union\\'s partnerships with regional\\norganizations like the Association of South-East Asian\\nNations (ASEAN), the Southern Common Market\\n(MERCOSUR) and the Southern African Development\\nCommunity (SADC) prove we are on the right course: We\\nwant an open, not a confrontational, kind of regionalism.\\nI am confident that the European Union will be an\\nanchor of stability in the twenty-first century. By\\nintroducing a single currency on 1 January 1999, it is\\nfocusing its energies. Its global role will increase. It is\\nabout to begin further negotiations on accession with\\nassociated partners. What Willy Brandt said about\\nGermany in 1989 applies today to the whole of Europe:\\n\"What belongs together is now growing together\".\\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) too\\nis also gradually opening its doors to the new\\ndemocracies. In the year of its fiftieth anniversary it will\\nadmit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Together\\nwith Russia, Ukraine and the other Commonwealth of\\nIndependent States members, we are developing a\\ncomprehensive security partnership.\\nTrue, the Russians are having a rough time at\\npresent, but the world needs a democratic and stable\\nRussia, a Russia which will play the role commensurate\\nwith its size, its status and its potential. Russia faces a\\nHerculean task of consolidating the economy and\\nmaintaining social stability. All those responsible must\\nface up to the challenge: the President, the Government,\\nthe parties and business. Of course, the regions too are\\ncalled upon.\\nI know from my talks with Prime Minister Primakov\\nlast week in Moscow that Russia intends neither to\\nchange course nor to go into reverse. The crisis in Russia\\naffects us all. We will not abandon Russia. It can count\\non us.\\nThe Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europeâs\\nside. A humanitarian disaster in the true sense of the\\nword is looming. The situation of the refugees, more than\\n250,000 of them, is desperate. International organizations,\\nthe European Union, the United States and Russia are\\ncoordinating their efforts to enable those who have been\\ndriven out to return to their villages.\\nTime is getting short; winter is just around the\\ncorner. Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with\\nBelgrade, with President Milosevic. He must realize that\\nthe international community will react with military force\\nif necessary. We still seek a political solution for\\nKosovo â€” self-administration within the Yugoslav\\nFederation. However, this cannot be achieved without\\nBelgrade and Pristina. So the weapons must now be\\nsilenced. We condemn the use of force by the Yugoslav\\nsecurity forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The\\nrecent reports we have received from Kosovo are very\\ndisappointing, troubling and worrisome. I hope they are not\\ntrue.\\nNATO is prepared to provide the backing for a\\npolitical solution. Yugoslavia and Kosovo are a part of\\nEurope. Their future can only be a European one. The\\nhistory of Europe in this century shows that we can\\novercome hatred and mistrust. But we have to have the\\nwillingness to do so.\\nIn Bosnia, too, we have seen animosity slowly being\\nreplaced by trust and cooperation. Recently I paid my\\ntwelfth visit to Sarajevo. That tormented city is slowly\\nbeginning to blossom again, and the country\\'s\\nreconstruction is progressing.\\nNonetheless, the peace process must continue to be\\nbuttressed by NATO and the Stabilization Force (SFOR),\\nfor the process is not self-sustaining. Regardless of the\\nresult of the elections, the international community will not\\ntolerate any reversal of the implementation of the peace\\nagreement. Furthermore, genuine peace will not return until\\nthe presumed war criminals and enemies of peace -\\nMr. Karadzic and his lot- have been brought to trial in\\nThe Hague.\\nOnly when those guilty of crimes against humanity,\\ntorturers and terrorists all over the world, have been\\nbrought to justice will we all be able to sleep peacefully.\\nThus, the establishment of the International Criminal\\nCourt on 17 July as a major step towards a world order in\\nwhich the force of law, not the law of force, prevails.\\nGermany was the driving force. I appeal to all countries to\\nsign and ratify the Court\\'s Statute.\\nNo one stands more at the mercy of those who wield\\npower than refugees. At present more than 20 million\\npeople worldwide are in flight: despairing elderly people,\\nwomen, children; people who are sick, homeless and\\ndestitute and have absolutely no idea what is going to\\nhappen to them.\\nOver the last several years I have been to many\\nrefugee camps, in Albania, Africa and the Middle East.\\nEvery refugee\\'s case is a story of immeasurable human\\nsuffering.\\nGermany is now the country with the second largest\\nnumber of refugees. From Kosovo alone, 150,000 refugees\\nhave found refuge in Germany.\\nThe suffering of the refugees is a humanitarian and\\npolitical challenge to the international community as a\\nwhole. What is now needed, therefore, is a global refugee\\npolicy. The United Nations, too, has to do something\\nabout it.\\nSpecifically, this means, first, a more equitable\\ndistribution of the refugees, as I recommended here in the\\nGeneral Assembly in 1993. We cannot leave the poorest\\ncountries to their own devices in trying to cope with the\\nrefugee problem.\\nSecondly, greater efforts will have to be made to\\nremove the causes of flight and expulsion.\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has declared the\\ntwenty-first century a century of prevention, and with\\ngood reason. To wait until a situation gets so bad that\\npeople have to take flight is to make oneself partly\\nresponsible. Trouble must therefore be nipped in the bud.\\nThis is the task of preventive diplomacy, of human rights\\nobservers and peacekeeping forces.\\nStriking at the root of mass flight and migration also\\nmeans eliminating the economic, ecological and social\\ncauses. The gap between rich and poor grows wider. The\\nwealthiest 20 per cent of the world population consume\\n86 per cent of all goods, the poorest 20 per cent only 1.3\\nper cent.\\nThis equity gap must be closed. Every individual has\\na right to live in dignity, free from hunger and want.\\nAll nations must be given a fair chance in global\\ncompetition, the poorest ones in particular. Hence, it is up\\nto the rich countries to help the poor make the most of\\ntheir opportunities for development.\\nOur aim is a social world market economy. This is\\nwhy in 1997 Germany spent 10.25 billion deutsche marks\\non bilateral and multilateral assistance measures as an\\ninvestment in peace and stability.\\nAfrica shows what can be achieved when the\\ninternational community and the countries concerned pull\\ntogether. Today, democratic elections are held in more\\nthan half of the African countries. In 20 African countries\\neconomic growth is between 4 and 6 per cent, and in 11\\nit is higher still.\\nWe want the Africans to know that we will not\\nabandon that vast continent and its 800 million people,\\ndespite the heavy burdens it still has to bear.\\nPoverty and refugee problems are also exacerbating\\nthe situation in the Middle East. The people in Israel and in\\nthe Palestinian territories long for peace more than anything\\nelse on earth. The peace process requires fresh impetus.\\nThe Israelis and Palestinians must move towards each\\nother again and rediscover the lost mutual trust.\\nWe Europeans will continue to support this process\\nwith our American friends. We back Israel\\'s legitimate\\nclaim to security for its State and citizens.\\nThe Palestinians have recognized that claim; now\\nwords must be followed by deeds. They must see to it that\\nterrorism has no chance.\\nBut Israel, too, must show compromise as regards a\\nfurther partial withdrawal. Neither side should put any new\\nobstacles in the way of a deal â€” and that includes allowing\\nnew settlements in the occupied territories.\\nParticularly in the Middle East, we have time and\\nagain seen that terrorism leads to a dead end, destruction\\nand suffering. We must pit all our strength against the\\ncynics who advocate violence, the fanatics and ideologues;\\nthe dead of Omagh, Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam serve as a\\nwarning. Those who plant bombs and murder people must\\nbe brought to justice.\\nDrying up the sources of terrorism â€” poverty, ethnic\\nconflict and fundamentalism â€” is our common\\nresponsibility. But to fight terrorism is not to fight Islam.\\nIslam is one of the great world religions. Nothing could be\\nfurther from the truth than the cliche that Islam is\\nsynonymous with fundamentalism and violations of human\\nrights.\\nWe want a dialogue of cultures and religions,\\nespecially with Islam. There exists an ethic of humanity\\nthat unites us all. This ethic is based on the inalienable\\ndignity of every individual, as expressed in the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the human rights\\ncovenants of the United Nations. These are the benchmarks\\nfor our joint action in the twenty-first century.\\nViolations of human rights are no longer an internal\\nmatter of States. They concern us all. Any group which,\\nlike the regime in Kabul, denies women their basic human\\nrights places itself outside the international community of\\ncommon values.\\nThe world of tomorrow will be judged by how we\\ntreat our children today. They are our most valuable asset.\\nYet the rights of many children are still being trampled\\nunderfoot. Millions of children have no chance to live a\\nlife in dignity. Millions of children are forced to work.\\nParticularly appalling is the fact that every year\\nsome two million children all over the world are sexually\\nabused. Only through joint action can we stop child\\nprostitution, traffic in children and child pornography,\\nincluding that proliferated via the Internet. I therefore\\npropose that the United Nations set up a contact point to\\ncoordinate worldwide efforts to eradicate sexual abuse of\\nchildren. The optional protocol to the Convention on the\\nRights of the Child designed to afford better protection\\nagainst sexual exploitation should be quickly adopted and\\nquickly put into effect.\\nChildren are small people who need big rights.\\nProtection for children during armed conflicts must be\\nimproved, including by outlawing their use as soldiers.\\nWe all hoped that with the ending of the East-West\\nconfrontation the danger of a nuclear conflagration would\\nbe gone forever. This has proved to be an illusion. The\\nthreat of proliferation of means of mass destruction\\nhovers over the human race. We can safeguard world\\npeace in the twenty-first century only if we keep such\\nterrible weapons under control.\\nIn Geneva, India and Pakistan have agreed to\\nnegotiations on a cut-off. That\\'s a good sign, but not\\nnearly enough. It must be followed by their accession to\\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. And all\\nnations should now sign the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Test-Ban\\nTreaty. This also applies to the conventions banning\\nchemical and biological weapons. The adoption of a\\nverification protocol to the Biological Weapons\\nConvention is now urgent.\\nNext March the Ottawa Convention imposing a\\nworldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines enters into\\nforce â€” a great success. Only if all countries now sign\\nthe Convention will these diabolical devices soon be\\nwiped from the face of the earth. It is our common task\\nto get rid of the 100 million mines still remaining, using\\nstate-of-the-art technology.\\nWe must also radically rethink our attitude to nature.\\nThe victims of the floods in China and Bangladesh are a\\nwarning. We must swing the wheel round now. This we\\nowe to our children and grandchildren. We can save our\\nblue planet and its ecosystem together or not at all.\\n\\nTake the world climate. The Kyoto Protocol launched\\na global effort to protect it. That was a big step forward.\\nBut time is getting short. We have just had the warmest\\nhalf year this century. At the fourth session of the\\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework\\nConvention on Climate Change, scheduled for Buenos Aires\\nin November, we shall have to agree on the instruments\\nwith which to achieve the objectives of Kyoto.\\nTake water. Water is irreplaceable. Water is more\\nimportant than oil. Yet in more than 80 countries it is in\\nshort supply. Two billion people have insufficient access or\\nnone at all to clean drinking water. Finding joint solutions\\nfor the peaceful use and conservation of water, the source\\nof life, is one of the great tasks of the twenty-first century.\\nThe pursuit of this scarce commodity must not be allowed\\nto spark fresh conflicts.\\nGermany intends to remain in the vanguard of the\\ninternational campaign to protect the environment. I am\\ngratified to note that our commitment has been\\nacknowledged by the appointment of Klaus Töpfer as\\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Environment\\nProgramme.\\nBut we are not going to rest on our laurels. A few\\ndays ago I opened an international conference in Potsdam\\non early-warning mechanisms for natural disasters. The\\nconference has shown that progress can be achieved if we\\nwant it. Specifically, it is now a question of establishing\\neffective global early-warning systems for environmental\\ncrises and natural disasters, and developing emergency\\nmanagement arrangements for the coordination of\\ninternational relief measures. We must now get down to\\nthis task, and the United Nations is the right place to do so.\\nFour hundred and sixty three days from now the\\ntwentieth century comes to an end â€” a century of\\nunprecedented violence and destruction. The coming\\ncentury must be a century with a humane countenance.\\nWhat a wonderful vision. But talking about it is not\\nenough. Only if we act together will we survive together.\\nThe United Nations is indispensable to this task.\\nStrengthening it to secure a peaceful and more equitable\\nworld â€” that is our responsibility. This we owe to coming\\ngenerations. My country will devote every possible effort\\nto this task.\\n', 'I speak to this Assembly with a sense of deference\\nand humility. Deference, because I realize that I am\\nspeaking to the greatest multilateral organization of all time\\nand from a rostrum where have stood almost all the great\\nstatesmen since the Second World War.\\nHumility because I was appointed just two months ago\\nto the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs, and so I am a\\nnewcomer for most of the delegates. However, this is no\\nway detracts from the pride that I feel regarding my\\ncountry?s long commitment to the United Nations system\\nand the support that this Organization has enjoyed in the\\nKingdom of the Netherlands.\\nI would also like to add that I feel reassured to realize\\nthat most of what I was going to say to the Assembly has\\nalready been said in the statement made by the Austrian\\nMinister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the European\\nUnion.\\n(spoke in English)\\nArticle 23 of the United Nations Charter says that the\\nGeneral Assembly shall elect 10 non-permanent members\\nof the Security Council. More to the point, the Article goes\\non to say that the Assembly, in doing so, must pay due\\nregard\\n“in the first instance to the contribution of Members\\nof the United Nations to the maintenance of\\ninternational peace and security and to the other\\npurposes of the Organization”.\\nWell, my country at present is up for election to the\\nSecurity Council. In fact, elections are due to be held in\\nthis very Hall in a few weeks time. And so it seems only\\nfair for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, as a candidate\\nfor the Council, to explain where it stands: where it\\nstands on some of the core issues now faced by the\\nUnited Nations family, where its stands on the state of\\naffairs in the Organization and where it stands on the\\nOrganization?s future. In other words, what is the\\nelectorate looking at?\\nWhat the electorate is looking at is what I would\\ndescribe as a nation responding. Throughout the Kingdom\\npeople hear the wants of the world, the needs of our\\nneighbours and of people in peril. It is in keeping with\\nthe Dutch character to be penny-pinching but generous to\\nthose in distress, to be demanding but tough on ourselves\\nas well, to hold strong views but carry a big heart —\\neasily critical, prone to compassion.\\nIn much the same manner we look at this\\nOrganization. We look at the Charter as a true monument\\nof modern times. We feel a strong commitment to\\nmultilateralism, for reasons of principle and for reasons of\\nnecessity. We seek to promote the institutions of\\nworldwide cooperation, with the United Nations at the\\ncore. Together, they span the entire range of human\\nactivity. We shall go on to give it the best we can offer\\nin the form of ideas and in the form of resources.\\nI would like to demonstrate how seriously we take\\nour Charter obligations by showing how, over the years,\\nwe have pursued the purposes of the United Nations, as\\nspelled out by the Charter in Article 1. First, peace and\\nsecurity. It is perhaps the most thankless responsibility the\\nUnited Nations carries. Indeed, the odds are\\noverwhelming. Since 1945, the number of violent\\nconflicts outstanding has risen from 4 to about 40. Their\\naverage length has grown from about two months to an\\naverage of 14.5 months in 1995. Peace and security is\\nwhere we have learned our lessons the hard way, and\\nmore mistakes are bound to be made. We, the Member\\nStates, need to shape up.\\nMeanwhile, the Dutch commitment to United\\nNations peacekeeping is borne out by our record. The\\nNetherlands has taken part in 20 peacekeeping operations\\nso far, is currently engaged in three of them and is getting\\nready to join a fourth one. Most recently, some 100 Dutch\\ntroops were stationed in Cyprus, where they are\\ncommitted to keeping the two Cypriot communities at\\npeace. All in all, some 1,650 Dutch troops are engaged in\\npeacekeeping and multinational supervision. In fact,\\npeacekeeping operations continue to form one of the\\n25\\n\\n\\nprincipal tasks of our armed forces, and we remain ready to\\nparticipate in up to four different peacekeeping efforts\\nsimultaneously at the level of a battalion.\\nPeacekeeping does not stand by itself. There should be\\na comprehensive response to the need for conflict\\nmanagement. We believe in a continuum between\\nprevention, on the one hand, and reconstruction and\\ndevelopment on the other hand. After all, many of the\\nconflicts raging today take place in the developing world.\\nAffluent societies cannot in good conscience walk away\\nfrom a conflict once the smoke has cleared. Donor\\ncountries cannot turn their backs to the ravages of war and\\nconcentrate on the next CNN headlines. We believe that\\nemergency aid and political initiatives should be teamed\\nwith longer-term development planning, reconstruction and\\nreconciliation. We believe in building a bridge between\\nconflict and development.\\nAnother pillar of Dutch foreign policy is our strong\\ndesire to ban weapons of mass destruction. Our objective\\nremains strengthening the non-proliferation regime,\\nsupporting real progress in negotiations on the reduction of\\nnuclear weapons, and making existing conventions on other\\nmega-weapons effective and more reliable.\\nStill, we are not talking only about mega-weapons.\\nThe transfer of small arms is a matter of concern for us as\\nwell. They are piling up fast, most of them illicit. In many\\ncountries they constitute a serious threat to the population\\nand to national and regional security and even contribute to\\nthe destabilization of States.\\nLandmines are the plague of modern warfare, leaving\\na disgraceful legacy of the present century to the next one.\\nOnce in the ground, they keep. To this day people are\\nmaimed or killed in Ypres, Belgium, by landmines put in\\nplace during the first strategic use of them, over 80 years\\nago. Mine clearance and banning anti-personnel landmines\\nhave been pursued with renewed vigour in recent years, and\\nwith due reason.\\nI now turn to the second of the purposes of the United\\nNations: developing friendly relations among nations. Let\\nme point to the manner and measure in which the\\nNetherlands has contributed towards this.\\nBy geographical necessity, the Netherlands has always\\nbeen a seafaring nation, a nation of traders. Besides making\\nus the eighth largest trading nation in the world, it has\\nmade us an outward-looking people, internationally\\noriented. Also, it has made us a multicultural society. Over\\n20 per cent of our population have their origins abroad —\\nin Africa, in Asia, in the Arab world and in the Americas.\\nOver time, we have built up strong relations with\\ncountries of all regions. Two constituent parts of our\\nKingdom, that is to say the Netherlands Antilles and\\nAruba, are located in the Americas. Our Caribbean\\nKingdom partners have important political and economic\\nrelations with their regional friends. They are engaged in\\nthe Economic Commission for Latin America and the\\nCaribbean (ECLAC), in the Organization of American\\nStates (OAS) and in the Caribbean Community\\n(CARICOM).\\nRightfully, Africa is high on the Netherlands?\\npolitical and development agendas. We encourage and\\nsupport African countries in establishing peace, stability\\nand democracy. We assist African nations in building up\\ntheir mechanism for conflict prevention, management and\\nresolution. We help Africa in strengthening its place in\\nthe world economy — for instance, through the World\\nTrade Organization. Dutch aid flows to all countries of\\nAfrica — last year over $600 million worth.\\nTurning now to Asia, the relations between the\\nNetherlands and a large number of Asian countries go\\nback to the sixteenth century. We are an original member\\nof the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\\nPacific (ESCAP). Naturally, therefore, we have assisted\\nAsian countries that have been hit by the financial crisis\\nand its economic and social effects. We do so through\\nmultilateral channels and through joint European and\\nAsian initiatives. Overcoming the crisis is important, too,\\nfor political stability in the region.\\nAs regards Central and Eastern Europe, the\\nNetherlands is heavily engaged in assisting countries of\\nthat region in their transition to market economy and\\ndemocracy. Our involvement is a central feature in our\\nrelations with all candidates for accession to the European\\nUnion. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are at present the\\nthird most important donor, and we contribute to the\\nStabilization Force and to various organizations engaged\\nin the region.\\nThe Netherlands and the Arab world have long-\\nstanding economic and cultural ties. The University of\\nLeyden has traditionally been a leading centre for the\\nstudy of Islam and Arab culture. We have a growing\\nArab community in the Netherlands. We continue to give\\nsubstantial support to the Palestinian people and are a\\n26\\n\\n\\nmajor donor to the United Nations Relief and Works\\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\\nThe third purpose of the United Nations, as spelt out\\nin Article 1 of the Charter, is by far the most complex. Its\\nbinding element is the promotion of international\\ncooperation, but cooperation in fields that, taken together,\\ncover a wide range of human interaction. I would like to\\nhighlight some of them, without, of course, meaning to\\ndiminish any of the others. Notably, I will touch on\\ndevelopment cooperation, human rights, and international\\nlaw.\\nPoverty eradication has been the primary focus of\\nDutch development aid policy for over a quarter of a\\ncentury. The Netherlands, whose aid programme last year\\nran close to $3 billion, has actively tried to strike a balance\\nin its aid policy between the economy, the environment and\\nthe people. We are pursuing development that is\\nsustainable — sustainable not purely in terms of ecology\\nbut in a wider sense: development that addresses basic\\nhuman needs, that respects human rights, that builds human\\ncapacities, that is socially responsible and that does not\\nmortgage the choices of future generations.\\nFor many years, my country has been more than\\nfaithful to the international target of 0.7 per cent of gross\\nnational product for development. The Organization for\\nEconomic Cooperation and Development average hovers\\naround 0.25 per cent. The Netherlands stands at a self-\\nimposed 0.8 per cent. In percentage terms, it takes third\\nplace among the major donors. In absolute terms, in money\\nspent, it has made us the sixth largest donor country\\nworldwide for 1997.\\nAll in all, $750 million from Dutch resources flowed\\nto the United Nations system and to the Bretton Woods\\ninstitutions in 1997. The new Netherlands Government is a\\nstrong believer in multilateral development cooperation. In\\nits first major policy statement, it pledged that multilateral\\naid flows, including those to the United Nations system, are\\ngoing to be expanded over the next several years.\\nAs the Charter says explicitly, international\\ncooperation applies also to promoting and encouraging\\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We\\nhave made no secret of our attachment to the cause of\\nhuman rights in the past; nor do we intend to hide it in the\\nyears to come. The Netherlands has been an active player\\nin the Commission on Human Rights since at least 1980,\\nhas seen several of its countrymen serve in prominent\\nhuman rights positions, has either drafted or supported\\ncountless resolutions and has strongly advocated standard-\\nsetting and monitoring. It is a topic that enjoys solid\\nsupport in Dutch society and has constituted a clear\\npolitical imperative for a quarter of a century. Member\\nStates can count on our toeing the line in the future.\\nPromoting respect for the rule of law at the\\ninternational level has been recognized as part of our\\nheritage ever since Hugo Grotius, in the early 1600s. In\\nmodern times, the Netherlands has sought to contribute to\\nthe advancement of international law. Areas where we\\nhave made contributions include human rights, legal\\ncooperation, crime prevention, criminal justice and so\\nforth. Much of the groundwork for the International\\nCriminal Court was done under Dutch chairmanship.\\nIf indeed we are to serve on the Security Council,\\nwhat will be our aims in the next two years? Our aim is\\nthe primacy of international law. Our aim is building\\nbridges. Our aim is addressing all issues before the\\nCouncil. Our aim is more contact between non-members\\nand the Council. And our aim is openness and\\ntransparency. In a nutshell, we will be driven by idealism,\\nbut guided by realism. It is in that spirit that we approach\\nour membership in the Council and, indeed, the future of\\nthis Organization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"I should\\nlike at the outset, Sir, warmly to congratulate you on your\\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly, which\\nmarks the opening of the regular annual session. Your wise\\nand dynamic leadership will determine the scope and\\noutcome of our work.\\nI would like also to thank Mr. Didier Opertti for his\\ndedication and commitment throughout the fifty-third\\nsession of the General Assembly.\\nLet me also reiterate Luxembourg's confidence, given\\nour Secretary-General's characteristic tireless determination\\nto promote dialogue, knowledge and mutual recognition,\\nthat his efforts will lead to greater mutual understanding.\\nThe respect accorded to, and the effectiveness of, our\\nOrganization will depend on the strong cohesiveness of its\\nmembership. Within its modest means, my country intends\\nto contribute to this key objective. Luxembourg is proud of\\nhaving participated in the definition of the European\\nUnion's core positions. These were explained to the\\nAssembly by Mrs. Tarja Halonen, the Minister for Foreign\\nAffairs of Finland, in the statement she made in her\\ncapacity as current Chairman-in-Office of the European\\nUnion.\\nThis fall will mark the tenth anniversary of the end of\\nthe cold war, which for more than four decades hampered\\nthe harmonious development of international relations.\\nAmong other things, it prevented our Organization from\\nfully discharging its mandate to maintain international\\npeace and cooperation. This anniversary is definitely a\\nhappy one, even if much of what had been hoped for in\\n1989 has failed to materialize and the consequences of\\ncertain upheavals are still being felt.\\nNonetheless, today's international environment has\\nseen far-reaching changes, and the international\\ncommunity is now in a position to tackle very complex\\nchallenges. My country hopes that this historic\\nbreakthrough at century's end will be further consolidated.\\nToday is my first opportunity to represent my\\ncountry from this rostrum and to address the Assembly,\\nwhich comprises nearly all the countries of the world.\\nLuxembourg is one of the founding Members of our\\nOrganization, and in October 1945, it was the smallest.\\nOur presence in San Francisco was due to our\\ndetermination to cooperate with the international\\ncommunity and to reaffirm our sovereignty. Today I\\nwould reiterate the commitment of the people of\\nLuxembourg to our Organization, which is called upon to\\nplay a pivotal role in an international environment that is\\nbecoming increasingly globalized yet, at the same time,\\nmore and more fragmented.\\nWhile the first aspect of this process, globalization,\\nis most apparent in the economic field, the second,\\nfragmentation, is more clearly felt in the political arena,\\nas social inequities are increasing. This process will\\nundoubtedly result in very complex tensions, heightening\\nthose that already exist and creating new ones. These will\\nhave to be analyzed and dealt with; to do this we will\\nneed imagination, clear-sightedness and, above all, an\\neffective resolve and capacity to act. Our security and\\nprosperity will depend on the way in which our\\nOrganization confronts these challenges.\\nIt would be unrealistic to expect a solution from the\\nOrganization every time humanitarian disaster strikes or\\na conflict breaks out. There is no such thing as a world\\ngovernment, and it would be a disservice to the United\\nNations to fail to acknowledge this obvious fact.\\nNevertheless, the United Nations is a platform and\\na forum for negotiations at the global level, and we\\nshould therefore exert every effort to ensure its smooth\\nfunctioning. To do this it must have adequate funding to\\nduty bound to respect their Charter obligation to pay in\\nfull, unconditionally and on time the amounts they owe to\\nthe Organization. This also means that increasingly, the\\n13\\n\\n\\nmajor political orientations of the Organization are decided\\nupon by consensus, thereby ensuring the support of all\\nStates for its actions. It also means that the effort to update\\nand reform the United Nations mechanisms still remains\\nfully relevant.\\nIt is only through cooperation, understanding and\\nsolidarity, together with respect for commitments entered\\ninto and for the rule of law, that progress towards a true\\ncohesiveness will be possible. All the Members of our\\nOrganization are directly responsible for ensuring that their\\ncontribution to the common undertaking and to its progress\\nis not lacking. This was the case during the decision to\\ncreate an International Criminal Court. We have thus\\nreached an important stage in the field of international\\nethics and morality by providing ourselves with an\\ninstrument through which those responsible for atrocities in\\ntime of war and for crimes against humanity will be held\\nto account. The international community will henceforth be\\nmore vigilant and will no longer allow those who have been\\nfound guilty of such crimes to continue to enjoy impunity.\\nMy country will ratify the Statute of the Court as soon as\\npossible, and we hope that it will soon become a reality.\\nMy country's profound commitment to the European\\nUnion, which is preparing to enlarge its membership, is a\\nsure reflection of our strong aspiration to strengthen both\\nthe internal cohesion of the countries of the region and to\\npromote cooperation at an international level. The\\ncontribution of the European Union to the life of our\\nOrganization is intended to be a driving force for its further\\ndevelopment.\\nSmall countries like mine tend to develop an acute\\nawareness of their own vulnerability. This is often further\\naggravated by a considerable difficulty: that of making\\nknown to our foreign partners a little-known national\\nreality. That explains our commitment to the vitality and\\nsmooth functioning of intergovernmental organizations. For\\nus, the United Nations represents an irreplaceable forum for\\nthe exchange of ideas and experiences, but to an even\\ngreater extent it must be a tool for the maintenance of\\ninternational peace and security, development and respect\\nfor universal values.\\nA new Government has just taken office in\\nLuxembourg. Its first task will be to ensure the continuity\\nof our foreign commitments. But it also intends consistently\\nto develop our policy of demonstrating our presence,\\nparticipation and solidarity at the international level. This\\ndetermination will be expressed through the major\\nintergovernmental organizations, which define the rules of\\ncoexistence between nations and peoples. The United\\nNations unquestionably takes pride of place among them.\\nMy Government also intends to further develop its\\nrelations with the more remote regions of the world. This\\nis an effort to respond to a real deficiency, which can be\\nexplained by our size and our limited human resources. It\\nis important for us to remedy that situation through a\\nbalanced programme of contacts. The United Nations, and\\nthe presence of numerous delegations at United Nations\\nHeadquarters in New York and at Geneva, will doubtless\\nprovide us opportunities conducive to achieving that end.\\nThe United Nations Development Programme\\nHuman Development Report this year undertakes an in-\\ndepth analysis of the phenomenon of globalization. It\\nclearly brings out the beneficial aspects and the\\nopportunities provided by this process, while at the same\\ntime showing the negative consequences, which are very\\nserious and worrying: instability in financial relations,\\nhigh unemployment, an unsteady job market, the ravages\\nof AIDS, the increasing inequalities between North and\\nSouth, the extension of those inequalities to the field of\\nknowledge and the constantly growing marginalization of\\na large number of developing countries.\\nThe political and social effects of these\\ndevelopments are no less worrying: increased\\nimpoverishment, new forms of crime and violence,\\nincreased migration, the destabilization of States and the\\ngrowing number of conflicts. Faced with these issues, the\\nStates Members of this Organization have a major\\nresponsibility to assume. The proposals contained in the\\nreport therefore deserve constructive examination, and my\\ndelegation is ready to take part in it. Ensuring that there\\nis a social and ethical dimension to globalization, agreeing\\non new rules for good world governance and protecting\\nthe environment are some of the major issues to be\\nagreed on in forthcoming discussions. That is why we\\nintend to deepen our commitment in areas related to\\nhuman development.\\nThe fight against poverty, which the United Nations\\nhas declared to be a priority objective, cannot be\\nconducted only in the economic sphere. It should be part\\nof an overall plan that also deals with related factors such\\nas the lack of family care facilities, shortcomings in\\neducation and health and insufficient administrative\\nstructures. A reallocation of resources is also required as\\npart of this effort. In that spirit, Luxembourg is now in\\nthe process of meeting the targets of our Organization.\\nStarting in the year 2000, it will be devoting 0.7 per cent\\n14\\n\\n\\nof its gross national product to official development\\nassistance. The Government of Luxembourg has decided to\\nincrease that contribution to 1 per cent of its gross national\\nproduct over the next five years. Education and health will\\nbe priority areas for our cooperation.\\nDuring the negotiations in the Millennium Round in\\nthe World Trade Organization we must take account of that\\ncontext and pay particular attention to the interests of the\\ndeveloping countries. We also support all the efforts\\ndesigned to alleviate the debt problem, particularly in the\\ncase of the least developed countries.\\nThe vast majority of the people of Luxembourg uphold\\na model of society that strikes a fair balance between free\\nenterprise and social justice. This model of a social market\\neconomy ensures development and social cohesion, even if\\nit may require periodic adjustment. This should prove an\\ninspiration at the regional and international levels.\\nThrough the experience that we have gained over one\\nand a half centuries of independence, Luxembourg is\\nconvinced that the principles of democracy, respect for\\nhuman rights, the functioning of the rule of law and the\\ntransparent and ordered management of public affairs are\\nthe essential elements that help to promote development.\\nThe major conferences that have taken place during the past\\ndecade on the subjects of human rights, social development,\\npopulation, the advancement of women and human\\nsettlements have opened a new era of constructive dialogue\\nand shared responsibility, which has made a major\\ncontribution to defining and redefining the action of the\\nUnited Nations in the field of development. We must\\nensure that henceforth there will be coordinated, integrated\\nand effective follow-up to the steps that have been taken.\\nThose who represent civil society, the non-\\ngovernmental organizations, are essential partners of our\\nGovernments in the implementation of the programmes and\\naction plans developed and adopted during the major\\nconferences. It is those people who work in the field in\\ndirect contact with women, men and children who are at the\\nvery centre or our efforts. We therefore attach great\\nimportance to their close association with the follow-up\\nprocess for the conferences and the preparations for future\\nactivities.\\nOther meetings are in preparation, notably those on the\\nsubjects of racism and development financing. Each of\\nthese initiatives is part of our effort to promote a fairer and\\nmore equitable society, both internationally and within our\\nown national societies. The United Nations serves as a\\ncatalyst in this process. It is undeniable that in this field\\nour Organization has found an innovative and useful role\\nto play.\\nIt is indeed paradoxical that a decade that was\\noriginally marked by a desire for openness has ended with\\na disturbing new outbreak of bloody conflicts and\\npractices that we thought had become things of the past.\\nHow can we overlook the growing number of\\nhumanitarian tragedies and fail to see the increasing\\nexpressions of nationalism, intolerance and refusal to\\naccept those who are different? They highlight the\\nhistorical or newly erected barriers which have made\\nimpractical any dialogue between majorities and\\nminorities.\\nIn these circumstances, there is a new requirement.\\nAs the Secretary-General has said, strict adherence to the\\ntraditional concept of State sovereignty is no longer\\nsufficient to meet present-day realities. We must\\ninvestigate new ways to live together in society that will\\nrespect the character of each individual. We must find\\nways to improve the functioning of democracy so that it\\nwill be better able to accommodate internal diversity.\\nThis Organization, especially the organ responsible\\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\\nhas not been given sufficient means to adapt to new\\nsituations. The structures of the Security Council are\\ninadequate after several decades during which it has been\\nimpossible to carry out a thorough review. Although\\ndiscussions on Council reform have been under way for\\nmore than five years, there is a prevailing feeling of\\npowerlessness. It seems unlikely that any new movement\\ncan result from the repeated clash of known positions.\\nSince last autumn, Security Council action has been\\nhamstrung by the reemergence of schisms harking back\\nto a bygone age. Now as then, the result is an inability to\\nact, so the matter of Iraq has been bogged down. For\\nmore than a year, Council members have been unable to\\nwork together and formulate a viable monitoring system\\nthat would guarantee that the Iraqi regime no longer\\npossesses weapons of mass destruction. This dispute\\nbenefits only those who continue to flout international\\nlaw. The credibility of the United Nations can hardly gain\\nfrom this prevarication.\\nThe recent political and humanitarian crisis in\\nKosovo has shown that the community of nations no\\nlonger has either sufficient determination or sufficient\\nmeans to prevent tragedies of that scale. In the face of the\\n15\\n\\n\\nhorror of ethnic cleansing, a number of countries were\\nobliged to shoulder their responsibilities. The tragic\\ndeterioration of the situation on the ground and the lack of\\nrealism at the negotiating table made military action\\ninevitable. My country demonstrated its active solidarity\\nduring that tragedy, because a passive response to such\\ncrimes is no more acceptable in the international arena than\\nit is at home. Today, pacification is under way in Kosovo,\\nbut minorities must be protected, respect for the law must\\nbe guaranteed, and democratic institutions must be set up.\\nThe Organization, in collaboration with other institutions,\\nhas taken these tasks in hand.\\nThe international community's commitment to build\\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural, democratic societies in the\\nBalkans holds out to the Serbian leadership and the Serbian\\npopulation the prospect of a peaceful, secure and\\nprosperous future in the community of Europe. It is up to\\nthem to seize this opportunity.\\nThe Secretary-General has said that United Nations\\naction cannot stop until stability, security and peace return\\nto the entire African continent. That goal is far from having\\nbeen achieved, with serious conflicts taking place in central\\nAfrica and in Angola. But there are glimmers of light in\\nSierra Leone, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\\nin the Horn of Africa. The crises there, while not yet\\nresolved, are at least on the path of negotiation. It is\\nencouraging to note that this progress has been achieved\\nthanks to the active participation of the countries of the\\nregion.\\nWe cannot allow the fate of Africa to slip out of the\\nfield of action of the international community. We must\\ncontrol the diverse situations relating to politics,\\ndevelopment and the democratization of society to enable\\nthe continent to recover its proper place in the comity of\\nnations. That can be achieved only through sustained,\\nconcerted medium-term and long-term action by the\\ninternational community and by the United Nations system.\\nMy country will participate fully in these efforts.\\nIn East Timor it seemed that, after 25 years of\\ninjustice and oppression, there was a process that would\\ngive the Timorese people an opportunity peacefully to take\\ncharge of their future. Their desire for independence was\\nfreely and clearly expressed under United Nations auspices.\\nDespite the Indonesian authorities having committed\\nthemselves to guaranteeing order and security before and\\nafter the popular consultation, grave violations occurred in\\nEast Timor, followed by massacres and the large-scale\\ndeportation of civilians. We welcome the dispatch of a\\nmultinational force under United Nations authority to put\\na rapid end to the violence and the atrocities, and to\\nrepatriate people in decent conditions. We support the\\nefforts of the Secretary-General and of the United Nations\\nMission in East Timor to continue the process leading to\\nthe independence of East Timor. We must quickly\\nimprove the island's humanitarian situation, which\\ncontinues to deteriorate, inflicting suffering on the\\npopulation concerned.\\nIn the Middle East, after years of deadlock, Israelis\\nand Palestinians have resumed negotiations with the\\nparticipation of other parties to the peace process, with\\nthe declared intention of concluding them by the autumn\\nof 2000, which would coincide with the Millennium\\nAssembly. Could anyone imagine a finer symbol of\\nconcerted international action to restore peace and\\nsecurity than lasting reconciliation in a land that is the\\ncradle of so many religions and so many civilizations?\\nThe Millennium Summit will give us the chance to\\ntake stock of what has been accomplished and of what the\\ncomplex decade of the 1990s has brought us, as well as\\nto chart the course for future action. The Secretary-\\nGeneral has outlined this in his report on the work of the\\nOrganization. We must give him effective tools to\\nforestall catastrophes, whether caused by the elements or\\nby the hand of man, and to coordinate our work to\\nminimize the consequences of tragedies we are unable to\\navert.\\nIn declaring its determination to tackle humanitarian\\nchallenges in a spirit of prevention rather than of reaction,\\nthe Organization has set itself an ambitious goal. It is up\\nto us to prove our will and our capacity to work\\neffectively to reach that goal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'I would like\\nfirst of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\\nAssembly. It attests to the esteem in which the\\ninternational community holds you and your country. I\\nwould like to include in this tribute the Secretary-\\nGeneral, who bears the weighty responsibility of\\npromoting the universality of the Organization and the\\neffectiveness of its action. Lastly, I wish to congratulate\\nthe three new Members of the United Nations. The great\\nand fine ideal that the United Nations embodies is very\\nmuch alive — of this I am firmly convinced.\\nThe United Nations is undertaking a grand civilizing\\nendeavour, a task that is constantly being challenged but\\never necessary. To unite peoples to work together for\\npeace and development, to affirm a body of legal rules\\nframing relations among States and to achieve common\\nstandards: that is the goal of the United Nations — a\\ncivilizing goal.\\nThat goal is achieved first of all through the peaceful\\nsettlement of conflicts. The role of the Security Council\\nin this mission is more vital than ever, a pre-eminence it\\nderives from the Charter. France will recall this\\nfundamental rule as often as necessary. To be sure, there\\nhave been circumstances when an urgent humanitarian\\nsituation dictated we should act immediately, but such an\\n26\\n\\n\\napproach must remain an exception. We must take care, as\\nin the case of Kosovo, to reintegrate this action into the\\ncontext of the Charter. Our fundamental rule is that it is for\\nthe Security Council to resolve crisis situations. For that\\nreason, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s new\\nstrategic concept recalls that the Washington Treaty\\nrecognizes the primary responsibility of the Security\\nCouncil in the maintenance of peace.\\nIndeed, the universal nature of the Organization is\\nintangible. The United Nations must strive to respond to\\ncrises, wherever they may occur. While we have not\\nhesitated to do precisely that in recent years and on several\\ncontinents, I would like to express regret at the relative\\ntimidity of the Organization where Africa is concerned. The\\nextent of the tragedies on that continent requires us to take\\nmore resolute action.\\nUniversality is compatible with complementarity in\\naction. In the interests of efficiency, the United Nations\\nmust encourage, in every part of the world, regional\\narrangements among States capable of handling crises in\\nthe first instance. Such is the spirit of Chapter VIII of the\\nCharter. Tasks should be realistically shared between the\\nregional organizations and the Security Council without\\nweakening the latter’s authority. For instance, my country\\nhas, through the RECAMP programme, along with others,\\nstrengthened African peacekeeping capabilities through\\nassistance provided under United Nations auspices in\\ncooperation with the Organization of African Unity.\\nInternational security also demands continued\\ndisarmament in the context of multilateral and verifiable\\nagreements. This is an ongoing objective for France, which\\nhopes that the work of the Conference on Disarmament will\\nbe relaunched in the months prior to the Review\\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. France would like to see\\nthe prompt entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\\nTest-Ban Treaty, the start of negotiations on banning the\\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear-weapon use, and\\nthe conclusion of a verification protocol to the Biological\\nWeapons Convention. We would not support any\\ndevelopment that might bring the Anti-Ballistic Missile\\nTreaty into question and upset strategic balances.\\nThe United Nations mission is not limited to the\\nsettlement of conflicts between States. With humankind’s\\ngrowing aspirations for greater freedom and responsibility,\\nthis mission extends to the safeguarding of human dignity,\\nwithin each State and, when necessary — as the Charter\\nallows — against States. State-instigated violence has\\nspawned serious humanitarian crises over the past few\\nyears. Civilians have been targeted, whole populations\\nhave been forcibly displaced, and refugee camps are not\\nlonger secure. This is unacceptable. Consequently, we\\nmust uphold the principle of international intervention,\\nunder United Nations auspices, to assist the victims.\\nEvery crisis recalls the need for the founding\\nprinciple of working for peace and for respect for the law\\nand the human person. A case in point is the conflict in\\nKosovo. Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which\\nlaid down the foundations of the settlement, illustrates\\nthese principles and this resolve.\\nWe have set ourselves ambitious objectives: ensuring\\nsecurity for all, organizing reconstruction, ensuring\\ncoexistence between communities, transferring authority\\nto local leaders, and promoting democracy and pluralism.\\nThe Secretary-General’s Special Representative and the\\nKFOR Commander have done remarkable work. Much,\\nhowever, remains to be done. The atrocities must be\\nstopped, the exodus stemmed and housing built before\\nwinter. On the political front, preparations must be made\\nfor the future, which will require establishing dialogue\\nbetween the communities. Elections will, I hope, be held\\nin the year 2000. France has made resolute efforts in this\\nrespect, alongside its partners in the European Union,\\nwhich is providing half the international financing agreed\\nupon by the conference of donors for Kosovo.\\nIn East Timor, another people is asking that its\\nrights be recognized. Overwhelmingly, it chose\\nindependence through a referendum. Some have tried to\\noppose that choice with violence. I therefore welcome the\\nadoption, on 15 September, of Security Council resolution\\n1264 (1999). It paves the way for the restoration of peace\\nand should enable the democratic process to be\\nsuccessfully concluded. France is participating in the\\ninternational force established by decision of the Security\\nCouncil.\\nOur Organization therefore remains true to the\\nvalues we celebrated last year, on its fiftieth anniversary.\\nBut much effort is still needed for these values to be\\nrespected everywhere. To achieve this, it is essential to\\nstrengthen international criminal law. France actively\\nsupports the work of the international criminal tribunals\\nof The Hague and Arusha. The establishment of the\\nInternational Criminal Court will be a new and decisive\\nstep in the progress of law. France hopes that it will be\\nset up quickly; to that end, it has already amended its\\nown Constitution.\\n27\\n\\n\\nTo carry out its mission, the United Nations needs\\nassured means. In order to deal with financial difficulties\\nand prevent these from becoming a pretext for inaction, all\\nMember States must meet their financial obligations\\nvis-à-vis the Organization. France does so completely and\\nunreservedly. A responsible attitude on the part of\\ncontributing States would advance the necessary reform of\\nthe Organization, including that of its Security Council.\\nI should like to share with the Assembly my second\\nfirm conviction: that the United Nations is admirably suited\\nto meeting the challenges of our new world. Indeed, its\\nmission is strengthened by globalization.\\nInitially, the idea of organizing relations between\\nStates at the world level may have seemed utopian to some.\\nIt was merely before its time. Indeed, I consider the United\\nNations to be modern for the following reasons. Our global\\nand unstable world needs organization and the goal of the\\nUnited Nations has always been to seek a better\\norganization of the world. The United Nations is in step\\nwith a networked world. It is itself a network, a rich and\\nunique panoply of specialized but independent and\\ncoordinated agencies. In half a century, the United Nations\\nhas made a tool for action which can be adapted to our\\nworld. The United Nations has not aged; it has grown with\\nthe world. It must allow us to face the new challenges\\nemerging in today’s world.\\nA contradictory state of affairs has replaced the\\neuphoric illusion which followed the end of the\\nconfrontation between blocs 10 years ago. Globalization is\\nnot monolithic. While it is unifying, it also divides. While\\nit generates remarkable progress, it also leads to\\nunacceptable inequalities. While it opens societies to one\\nanother, it carries with it the threat of creating uniformity.\\nWhile it frees up energy, it also releases negative forces\\nthat must be brought under control. The movement of\\npopulations and the clash of cultures are therefore\\naccompanied by rising fears as to identity, by religious\\nintolerance and by xenophobia. France, which has a\\npresence on five continents and is itself a land of\\nimmigration, has had experience of such confrontations in\\nits history. It knows the risks they entail and the wealth\\nthey bring. We will give our full support to the world\\nconference on racism, to be held in 2001. Preventing the\\nemergence of prejudice, which too often has deadly\\nconsequences, will prepare the way for peace for future\\ngenerations.\\nThe fruits of globalization are not shared equally. The\\nopening of economies, the increase in trade and the\\nacceleration of technological progress all fuel growth. But\\ninequalities are growing between countries and within\\neach economy. Nearly one in four human beings lives in\\ngreat poverty. We cannot leave matters as they stand. The\\nrapid expansion of communications networks does not\\nbenefit everyone. Yet the multiplication of sources of\\ninformation, the increased circulation of ideas and the\\nprofusion of new inventions are full of promise. Lower\\ncommunications costs made possible by the Internet can\\nbe an asset for businesses in countries in the South. But\\ninequalities in education hinder access to these\\ntechnologies. These impressive instruments for furthering\\nknowledge may become formidable factors in inequality.\\nCommunication is also a right. It is essential that this\\nright not be threatened by the concentration in just a few\\nhands of sources of information and the means of\\nproduction and distribution. France will staunchly defend\\ncultural diversity.\\nGlobalization must encourage all of us to take\\naccount of the fragility of our world — our Earth and our\\ncommonweal. Our environment is not a product, a simple\\nstock of raw materials on which we can draw without\\ngiving thought to future generations. True development is\\nsustainable development. Since the Rio Summit in 1992\\nthis realization has been behind the adoption of important\\ncommitments with regard to the climate, biodiversity and\\ndesertification. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change and\\nthe current negotiations on a protocol on biosafety attest\\nto the importance of the achievements. But the uncertain\\nfuture of climates and the recurrence of natural\\ncatastrophes urge us to make further efforts.\\nThe Earth is fragile, but so, too, is the human\\nspecies. The spread of new epidemics endangers the\\nhealth of entire populations. Inequalities in development\\nexacerbate those scourges. Some 40 million people live\\nwith the AIDS virus today, the majority of them in\\ndeveloping countries. The spread of the pandemic in\\nAfrica is a matter of major concern for us. I shall come\\nback to that issue.\\nGlobalization is changing the nature of organized\\ncrime, an area in which there has been a real explosion.\\nThe much greater fluidity in movement allows criminal\\nnetworks to exploit the inconsistencies between one\\nnational law and another and the weaknesses of some of\\nthem so as to hide from justice. My country is ready to\\nmake every effort to combat this scourge. The President\\nof the French Republic made that clear last year at the\\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to that\\nissue. The United Nations has long been engaged in the\\n28\\n\\n\\nfight against international drug-trafficking, building up\\nexpertise, establishing specialized services and drafting a\\nbody of doctrine and a legal framework. These must be\\nstrengthened. But, above all, States must be more\\ncommitted to action. In January negotiations began in\\nVienna on a convention against transnational organized\\ncrime. We must bring this to a satisfactory conclusion in\\nthe year 2000.\\nFaced with globalization, we have a choice to make.\\nWe can either go along with the supposedly universal\\neconomic laws, and in so doing abdicate our political\\nresponsibilities, or we can seek to impose order on\\nglobalization and thereby achieve control of our collective\\nfuture. For my part, I believe that global problems call for\\nglobal responses and that an unstable world needs to be\\nregulated, requiring what our Anglo-Saxon friends might\\ncall “rules and regulations”. This world needs rules. It\\nneeds the United Nations.\\nThis choice is also a matter of sovereignty. As the\\nSecretary-General pointed out on 8 December last year in\\nParis, the first words of our Charter, “We the Peoples of\\nthe United Nations”, make it an expression of popular\\nsovereignty. But in order for the sovereignty of peoples to\\nbe affirmed they must find the means to acquire the\\nmechanisms, the means of control and the benefits of\\nglobalization. That is my third conviction. The more the\\nworld becomes globalized, the more it needs rules. Faced\\nwith the temptation of unilateralism, it is more necessary\\nthan ever to base our action on multilateral rules respected\\nby all. First of all, these concern the economy. We must\\ndefine the rules of the game so that everyone can benefit\\nfrom globalization. We must define the rules of the game\\nbetween the industrial and developing countries and\\nbetween the major economic actors, small and medium-\\nsized business and the citizens of our countries who work\\nand produce.\\nIn the financial sphere, we have to strengthen the\\nstability of the monetary and financial system by ensuring\\nthe political legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund\\n(IMF), involving the developing countries more closely in\\nthe adoption of common rules and making private financial\\noperators liable for the consequences of their decisions for\\ncountries in crisis. Real progress has been made since the\\ncrises of 1997 and 1998. France contributed to this by its\\nproposals, especially in regard to hedge funds and fiscal\\nhavens. It will continue to work to this end, as much\\nremains to be done.\\nThese rules of the game have to be based on better\\ncoordination among international institutions. Since 1945,\\ninternational cooperation has respected the principle of\\nspecialization of institutions. In the future, the task is to\\nmake them more complementary. Economic and trade\\nrules cannot disregard the most elementary social and\\nenvironmental norms. Accordingly, France supported the\\nadoption by the International Labour Conference a year\\nago of a declaration on the fundamental principles and\\nrights involved in labour. The International Labour\\nOrganization (ILO) is an irreplaceable forum for dialogue\\nbetween government and social partners and for the\\nformulation of minimal standards. It is desirable that it\\nestablish close relations with other organizations, such as\\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World\\nBank.\\nFor these rules of the game to be better respected,\\nappropriate cooperation has to be established with the\\npoorest countries. Their debt burden continues to be the\\nprimary obstacle to development. At their meeting in\\nCologne, the G-7 countries pledged to grant further debt\\nrelief. France contributed to this. Three principles will be\\napplied: solidarity, which calls for us to grant the poorest\\ncountries the most favourable debt treatment; fairness,\\nwhich requires the rich countries to share the financial\\neffort in a balanced way; and responsibility, whereby the\\ncountries benefiting from this aid undertake policies\\ndirected towards sustainable development and the fight\\nagainst poverty. For these countries, official development\\nassistance remains indispensable. France will continue to\\nadvocate greater effort on the part of the richest countries.\\nOur action should be increasingly inspired by the\\naffirmation of common values and rules. Human rights\\nare central to this approach. I am referring in particular to\\nthe weakest children. The ILO Convention which outlaws\\nthe worst forms of child labour is a new case in point.\\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\\nChild must be supplemented as soon as possible by the\\ntwo protocols now being negotiated, one against the\\nrecruitment of children in armed conflicts, the other\\nagainst the sale of children and child prostitution and\\npornography.\\nTo affirm the rights of women is to recognize their\\ndecisive role in education, in the production of wealth and\\nin development. But it is also to combat the\\ndiscrimination and violence which they suffer. France has\\nmade equality between women and men one of the\\ncornerstones in the renewal of its public life. The\\nadditional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\\n29\\n\\n\\nof All Forms Discrimination against Women, submitted to\\nthe General Assembly for approval, offers women the\\npossibility to assert their rights in an individual capacity.\\nThat is a major step forward. The special session of the\\nGeneral Assembly in June 2000 will highlight the progress\\nthat has been achieved since the 1995 Conference in\\nBeijing.\\nReaffirming the right of all human beings to health\\nmeans combating pandemics everywhere. In December\\n1997, in Abidjan, France proposed the establishment of a\\n“therapeutic solidarity fund” to mobilize the international\\ncommunity to care for and treat AIDS sufferers. The\\ncountries of the South and associations involved in\\ncombating the disease welcomed the proposal warmly. But\\nthe impact of AIDS on development remains dramatic. We\\nmust intensify our efforts to reduce this plague. Only the\\nUnited Nations can give these efforts the necessary breadth.\\nThe principle of precaution has to be the basis for our\\naction regarding the environment and health safety. The\\nMontreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer,\\nbased on the principle of differentiated commitments\\nbetween the North and South, is an example of well-\\nconceived international action. These efforts must be\\ncontinued. We will do so by advocating, with our European\\nUnion partners, a world convention on forests and by\\nredoubling efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the\\natmosphere. Precaution must also be the guiding principle\\nin monitoring food safety. The combination of concern for\\nsustainable agriculture, the quality of products and the\\npreservation of food traditions in each country explain the\\nintensity of recent reactions. France therefore intends to see\\nthese demands taken into account at the forthcoming WTO\\nnegotiations.\\nIn order to address and overcome the world’s\\nproblems, to derive the best from globalization, we need\\nnations to be aware of their responsibilities, and we need\\nalso to have “more” of the United Nations. Through an\\nOrganization strengthened by a renewed sense of mission,\\nsupported by sovereign States and regional organizations,\\nwe will be able to further respect for human rights, promote\\ndemocracy, work for sustainable development and help all\\nto achieve their potential.\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"I should\\nlike first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\\nPresident of the General Assembly and to thank you for\\nhaving accepted the weighty task that you will be carrying\\nout during this session. We also wish to express our best\\nwishes to your country, Namibia, which you so ably\\nrepresent. We also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr.\\nOpertti, for the manner in which he guided our work\\nduring the previous session.\\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend\\nmy sincere congratulations to the Republic of Kiribati, the\\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their\\nadmission to our Organization.\\nMy statement is in line with the statement made here\\nby the Presidency of the European Union. I wish merely\\nto highlight some of the issues that are particularly\\nimportant for us.\\nEarly in the month of August, two young African\\nchildren, Yaguine and Fodé, were found dead, stowed\\naway in the landing gear of a Sabena aeroplane, victims\\nof an idealism and an innocence that led them to embark\\non a reckless voyage in search of the mirages of western\\nsociety.\\nYaguine and Fodé left us a moving message, of\\nwhich I would like to quote some passages here:\\n“To the people in charge in Europe: it is to\\nyour solidarity and to your kindness that we make\\nan appeal for help for Africa ... We are suffering\\nenormously ... We have war, disease ... We have\\nschools, but in order to get a good education and\\ngood teaching, one needs large amounts of money;\\nand our parents are poor.\\n“So, we Africans, especially African children\\nand young people, ask you to create a great and\\neffective organization for Africa ... We need you to\\nfight poverty”.\\nThe great organization of which Yaguine and Fodé\\ndreamed is here before me in its most universal form. It\\nwas conceived from the outset for the maintenance of\\npeace and for economic and social development. The\\nauthors of the Charter regarded those two aspects as\\ninseparable. Over the last decade, this great Organization\\nhas succeeded in laying a worldwide foundation for\\neconomic and social values aimed at creating a more\\ncivilized world, a world in which globalization has\\ngradually come to the fore.\\nHere I am thinking of the discrete but tenacious\\nwork at the great United Nations conferences and\\nsummits to find new directions for development. That\\nsignificant work must be continued and consolidated. The\\n15\\n\\n\\nuniversal commitments made at Jomtien for education, at\\nRio de Janeiro for the environment, at Vienna for human\\nrights, at Copenhagen for social development, at Cairo for\\npopulation and development, at Beijing for women, at\\nRome for hunger and at Istanbul for human settlements\\nconstitute irreversible gains for mankind. It is gratifying\\nthat the concerns debated and the conclusions adopted at\\nthose conferences have increasingly become the inspiration\\nfor our national policies and are helping to bring about the\\nindispensable convergence among those policies.\\nBut the tragedy of Yaguine and Fodé brings us face to\\nface with the harsh reality of unbalanced development. As\\nI speak, 1.3 billion women and men are surviving — or\\ntrying to survive — on less than one dollar per day; 840\\nmillion of them, including 160 million children, suffer daily\\nfrom hunger or malnutrition. Even more serious, as those\\ntwo teenagers remind us, 260 million children have no\\naccess to primary or secondary school because of a lack of\\nmeans. Every day, 250 million children go to work instead\\nof to school. At the dawn of the third millennium, it is\\nincreasingly difficult for our civilization to tolerate such\\nsocial and human marginalization and such a lack of\\nsolidarity, in particular for our children.\\nWe must forge stronger solidarity within the United\\nNations. We must restore humanism to its rightful place in\\ninternational relations. For this fight against poverty and\\nthis campaign for emancipation to succeed, we must agree\\nto a decisive review of the mechanism that underlies the\\neconomic fluctuation, that causes financial tension and its\\nattendant social consequences, and that tolerates massive\\nexploitation of the weakest by forces that are often\\nimpersonal and unidentifiable.\\nHence, we are deeply convinced that we must restore\\nthe primacy of political leadership in our globalized society.\\nWe must endeavour without hidden agendas to organize a\\nnew world political order. We need stronger and more\\ncoherent United Nations action for economic and social\\ndevelopment, which requires the use of all available global\\ntools for economic, financial and commercial governance.\\nThis means we must be more determined to restoring the\\nprimacy of policy and no longer to permit democratic\\nlegitimacy to be circumvented or even flouted by selfish or\\nspeculative interests. The rights of peoples must always\\nprevail over the power of money.\\nBelgium will support United Nations efforts to restore\\nthe Organization's mission to protect against the\\nunacceptable side-effects of globalization. In that spirit, my\\ncountry attaches great importance to the success of the\\ncoming Millennium Assembly. In that context, Belgium\\nis pleased that it will serve as host to the Third United\\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in\\nthe spring of 2001, which will bring together in Brussels\\nall development partners. We hope that this major event\\nwill lead to a renewed commitment to the integration of\\nthese countries in the world economy on the basis of\\nconcrete and quantifiable objectives. The Belgian\\nGovernment, which recently came into office, has clearly\\nexpressed its political will gradually to increase our\\nfunding of bilateral partnerships and cooperation. We\\nshall pay particular attention to the quality and the\\ncoherent implementation of the projects we sponsor.\\nI express the wish that this Assembly session be\\nconducted under the banner of Africa. Your stimulating\\nopening statement, Mr. President, and the addresses by\\nPresident Mbeki of South Africa and by President\\nBouteflika of Algeria, sent a strong message in that\\nregard. We Belgians have a traditional interest in the\\npolitical, economic and development prospects of Central\\nAfrica. Belgium must reestablish the bonds with that\\nregion which history and experience have bestowed upon\\nit. This also implies responsibilities which my\\nGovernment will endeavour to shoulder in a responsible\\nand coherent manner. I am thinking in particular of the\\ntwofold task of the United Nations as an organization\\nboth for the maintenance of peace and for the promotion\\nof development. I also have in mind human rights issues,\\nof which my Government is particularly aware.\\nAgainst this backdrop, the new Belgian Government\\nhas placed cooperation with Central Africa at the top of\\nits agenda. To us, it is important that peace and stability\\nshould return to Central Africa. The Lusaka Ceasefire\\nAgreement offers hope. It requires the political will of the\\nvarious parties concerned to address the root causes of the\\npresent conflict and to seek solutions at a regional level.\\nA significant effort by the international community will\\nbe necessary to encourage and support them. My country\\nwill do its share, and will intensify its direct contacts and\\nits financial support. Belgium has responded to the appeal\\nof the Security Council by placing liaison officers at the\\ndisposal of the Secretary-General. They will be deployed\\nin accordance with Security Council resolution 1258\\n(1999) of 6 August 1999.\\nIt goes without saying that we fully respect the wish\\nof African leaders that they should find their own political\\nsolutions to the conflicts that undermine the continent.\\nBut this can imply no ambiguity about the roles of the\\nSecurity Council and of the General Assembly. Nor does\\n16\\n\\n\\nit mean that the rest of the world should refrain from\\naction: achieving peace in the Great Lakes region will\\nrequire tremendous efforts and resources.\\nHere we must think about concluding a true\\npartnership pact with the countries of Central Africa.\\nInspired by the Stability Pact for the Balkans, this would\\nform part of a genuine strategy for cooperation among\\ncountries. With the support of the major financial\\ninstitutions, such a pact could revitalize the economic\\nmechanisms of partner countries and reinvigorate their\\nsocial and democratic development. We believe such s\\npartnership pact should be based on the voluntary and\\nmutually respectful cooperation of each African and non-\\nAfrican signatory country and should in no way be\\nconstrued as an attempt at neo-colonial domineering of that\\npart of the world.\\nOther regions of Africa deserve more attention and\\neffort on the part of the international community. I think in\\nparticular of the bloody conflict which has plunged Angola\\ninto unspeakable humanitarian tragedy. I also think of the\\nwar between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which must be prevented\\nfrom extending into Somalia. In Sierra Leone, the efforts of\\nneighbouring countries, which Belgium and other partners\\nhave supported, give reason for optimism. We also hope\\nthat Guinea-Bissau will regain civil peace. But much\\nremains to be done to improve the situation of the peoples\\nof southern Sudan and of Somalia.\\nWhatever the media's focus, now turned towards other\\nparts of the world, it is important that we do not forget the\\nsuffering of men, women and especially children of those\\ncountries of Africa, who aspire to education, health and\\ndevelopment. The new international policies, based more on\\nbalance and on the sharing of prosperity, should be directed\\ntowards them, too.\\nI turn briefly to North Africa. The presidency of the\\nEuropean Union recalled that the Maghreb countries are\\nexperiencing significant growth. They remain an essential\\npartner for Europe and for world peace, prosperity and\\ndevelopment. Economic, social, cultural and political ties\\nwith the southern Mediterranean basin will have to be\\nstrengthened in the coming months and years.\\nI also hope that the international Community will fulfil\\nits commitment to support the Middle East peace process.\\nThere, too, it will be a matter of releasing the financial and\\nhuman resources to ensure the economic, social and\\ndemocratic development of the various regions and peoples\\nwho are committed to peace. My country is ready to\\nrespond to calls for cooperation in this regard.\\nThere is another region where the United Nations\\nhas been called upon to play a crucial and difficult role.\\nThe Kosovo crisis has implications for the security of my\\ncountry and Europe as a whole. It also obliges us to ask\\na sensitive question about the limits to the right of the\\ninternational community to intervene in the internal affairs\\nof a State.\\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\\nintervention has appreciably reinforced the idea that moral\\nand ethical considerations are in the process of\\novershadowing the traditional concept of national\\nsovereignty in international relations. If there is one\\nlesson for our Organization to learn from the twentieth\\ncentury, it is that for no State can the massacre of its own\\npeople be considered an “internal affair”, under any\\npretext. This legal formalism would ultimately amount to\\nadmitting that, as the head of the United Nations Interim\\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Bernard\\nKouchner has said, it would be “legitimate, although not\\nelegant, to massacre one's own people”.\\nYet the Security Council is well-equipped to deal\\nwith massive violations of human rights. Article 42 of the\\nUnited Nations Charter allows the Council to qualify such\\nviolations as a threat to international peace and security\\nand to authorize armed intervention, as it has on several\\noccasions — for example, in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991; in\\nSomalia in 1992; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994; and\\nin Liberia and Sierra Leone in 1997.\\nIf the Security Council could not fully play its role\\nat the beginning of the Kosovo crisis, this was due less to\\na divergence of views between States over the essence of\\nthe problem than because there was a rift between the\\nadvocates of the right of humanitarian intervention and\\nthe defenders of the traditional legal system, which\\nregards national sovereignty as the absolute foundation of\\ninternational relations. My country deeply regrets that a\\npotential double veto constituted an insurmountable\\nobstacle that was inappropriate given the extreme urgency\\nof the situation. We hope that resorting to force without\\nthe Council's approval will not constitute a precedent. The\\nworld needs an international legal order that prevails over\\nthe law of the jungle. In this respect, we all hope that\\nresolution 1244 (1999) signals a return to international\\nlegality.\\n17\\n\\n\\nBelgium welcomes the decisive attitude of the Security\\nCouncil regarding East Timor. We hope for a speedy\\nrestoration of normality there, with the return of its\\ninhabitants, reconstruction of the country and the\\nestablishment of a state of law resulting from the expressed\\nwill of its people.\\nHere it is opportune to recall the urgent need for the\\ninternational community to provide itself with the tools\\nneeded to prevent and punish barbaric acts. We need a\\ntribunal charged with prosecuting those responsible for the\\ngravest crimes affecting the whole international community.\\nThe adoption in Rome of the Statute of the International\\nCriminal Court is an important landmark. I appeal to all\\nStates to sign and ratify it so that the Court can start to\\noperate as soon as possible. Belgium's ratification of the\\nStatute is imminent. This new tribunal must be endowed\\nwith the human and material means necessary for the\\naccomplishment of its mission.\\nThis leads me to the issue of United Nations reform,\\nand primarily the reform of the Security Council.\\nFor six years a Working Group under the guidance of\\nthe President of the General Assembly has attempted, with\\nmore or less success, to ascertain which reforms would\\nmake it possible to re-gild the coat of arms of the Security\\nCouncil. In spite of the efforts of successive Presidents,\\nlittle progress has been made. Nevertheless, the scope of\\nthe issue and possible improvements have been identified.\\nI believe that new momentum can come only from a new\\ndetermination on the part of our Governments.\\nIn the view of my country, the Security Council is an\\nanachronistic reflection of the world of 1946. In 53 years\\nthe number of independent countries has grown fourfold,\\nand new great Powers can, whether on economic,\\ndemographic or geopolitical grounds, legitimately claim a\\nlarger share of international responsibility.\\nThe reasons for reform are evident. Lack of it,\\ncontinuance of the status quo and opposition to change\\ninvolve the following dangers.\\nCountries which are legitimate candidates for a\\npermanent seat on the Security Council, frustrated in their\\nambitions, will be less inclined to contribute to the\\ncollective effort to maintain peace, prevent conflict and give\\nmultilateral development aid. Equally, other countries,\\nunable to justifiably claim a permanent seat, will be\\ndeprived of participation in shouldering global\\nresponsibilities, because of their number and the lack of\\nobjective rotation criteria. That will bring about a loss of\\nrepresentativeness and legitimacy, and ultimately of the\\nCouncil's authority.\\nMy country chairs a group of 10 Member States\\nseeking a solution that can command the broadest\\npossible support. In spite of the obstacles, we intend to\\npersevere.\\nThe reforms that we are considering are not limited\\nto the Security Council; they also aim at rendering the\\nmachinery of the United Nations more effective and\\nefficient. I pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\\nwho has thrown himself into the task with great\\ndetermination.\\nThe United Nations continues to be an indispensable\\nOrganization. It must be strengthened so that it can carry\\nout the tasks and responsibilities given it by the Charter.\\nReform is therefore essential to strengthen the\\nmechanisms for the solidarity and harmonious\\ndevelopment to which we all aspire.\\nThis reform must be accompanied by a sound\\nfinancial outlook. There has been no improvement over\\nthe last 12 months; this situation must be redressed.\\nBelgium, like the many other States which pay their\\ncontributions on time and unconditionally, calls for all\\nMember States to do the same. It will be understood, of\\ncourse, that here I am looking particularly towards\\nWashington. Belgium, a friend and ally of the United\\nStates, reaffirms that it is essential that that country play\\nits role in the United Nations. We all need the United\\nStates, but it must shoulder its responsibilities, including\\nits financial responsibilities, within our Organization.\\nSo far I have mostly spoken of what is not working.\\nBut there are many areas where progress, even\\nconsiderable progress, is being made. The Organization\\nhas played a considerable role in giving an ethical\\ndimension to the criteria governing international relations.\\nMy country welcomes this. As the first victim of\\nchemical weapons — gas used on the battlefields of the\\nYser — Belgium was a passionate advocate of the\\nprocess that led to the conclusion and the implementation\\nof the Chemical Weapons Convention. Similarly, we are\\nsupporting the efforts to combat biological and\\nbacteriological weapons and the fight to abolish anti-\\npersonnel mines. We are also presently engaged in efforts\\nto reduce the spread of small arms.\\n18\\n\\n\\nThe anarchistic accumulation of small arms and the\\nscourge of anti-personnel mines remain among the most\\nacute problems at this close of the century. These weapons\\nexacerbate conflicts and are instruments of death and terror,\\nin Africa as well as in Asia, Latin America and the\\nBalkans. Nor do the societies of Western Europe and North\\nAmerica escape this cancer, the full extent of which has yet\\nto be felt.\\nSeveral initiatives have been taken to tackle these\\nproblems, and my country was fully involved in them. By\\nway of example I would like to mention the Brussels\\nconference of October 1998 and the Code of Conduct and\\nthe common action of the European Union, as well as our\\nparticipation in and financial support for the expert groups\\nset up by the Secretary-General.\\nWe will continue our policy of prevention and\\nreduction with regard to accumulations of small arms, as\\nwell as our fight for the abolition of anti-personnel mines.\\nIn general, in the appropriate forums we will continue\\nto take initiatives to promote arms control and disarmament.\\nI am thinking, for example, of the reinforcement of the\\nBiological Weapons Convention, limitations on arms-\\ntrafficking, the intensification of the fight against the\\nviolation of embargoes on weapons transfers and the fight\\nagainst the increase of nuclear arsenals.\\nFrom economic and social development to\\ndisarmament or humanitarian intervention, there is a central\\ntheme that underlies all our actions: human rights. It has\\nbecome clearer and clearer in the past few years that human\\nrights are intertwined with the promotion of international\\npeace and security, economic prosperity, sustainable\\ndevelopment and social justice.\\nIn all the reforms of the activities and the structures of\\nthe United Nations that have been carried out with the\\nimpetus of the Secretary-General, the promotion of human\\nrights is a cross-cutting theme involving all the\\norganizations and agencies that operate on a global scale.\\nBelgium supports this global and integrated approach\\nwithout reservations; but the task is immense. Thus, it is in\\nthe interest of the United Nations to ensure the\\ncollaboration of regional organizations, whose competencies\\nand potential in this field can help in the achievement of\\nthese common objectives.\\nThe inaugural address of the new Belgian Government\\nunequivocally put human rights at the top of its agenda and\\nannounced its intention of pursuing an active policy\\nwithin all the relevant international organizations.\\nI would like to pay particular homage to our\\nSecretary-General, whose patience and tact have often\\nmade the difference in extremely difficult circumstances.\\nMy Government remains a steadfast supporter of all his\\ninitiatives to prepare our Organization for the challenges,\\nknown and unknown, that lie ahead in the next century.\\nThrough the Secretary-General I would like to pay\\nspecial tribute to the United Nations personnel, and\\nparticularly to all those who died on the field of honour\\nin humanitarian or peacekeeping missions. Every year the\\nlist of victims gets longer. My country appeals to the\\nglobal conscience to respect United Nations personnel and\\nto ensure that crimes against them do not go unpunished.\\nIn conclusion, I sincerely hope that the actions of the\\nSecretary-General will make our Organization more\\ncredible and more effective, for the United Nations\\nremains the indispensable universal instrument to achieve\\nour common goals. It is a beacon in an increasingly\\ninterdependent world, a source of hope for the Yaguines\\nand Fodés of all the continents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Mr. President,\\nfirst let me congratulate you on your election to your high\\noffice and assure you of the full cooperation and support\\nof the Austrian delegation. I am convinced that we will\\nhave a successful session of the General Assembly, the\\nlast in this century, under your able guidance.\\nAustria fully endorses the statement which was so\\neloquently delivered by the Foreign Minister of Finland\\non behalf of the European Union. I would like to add the\\nfollowing observations to that very comprehensive\\nstatement.\\nThe United Nations in many ways finds itself at a\\ncrossroads. The Organization has to find its role and\\nstrengthen its relevance in an increasingly turbulent world.\\nTo be sure, we are able to make progress on specific\\nissues. But is that enough in the face of mounting global\\nchallenges? Much has been said and written in the last\\nfew years about globalization, and I believe we are all\\naware of the speed and impact of this very dynamic\\nprocess. What we still need is a coherent political\\nresponse to this phenomenon. We have to meet the\\nchallenges and make the best possible use of the\\nopportunities presented to us.\\nWhile our everyday work must be focused on\\nreaching achievable goals within a realistic time, we must\\nnever lose sight of our larger duty to provide human\\nsecurity in its fullest sense. This means that we have to\\nprovide individuals and communities with security,\\ndignity and quality of life. We have to protect them\\nagainst threats to their safety and well-being, such as\\nconflict, discrimination, poverty, organized crime,\\ncorruption or repression.\\nIn recent years, a number of initiatives have been\\nsuccessfully launched, in particular on landmines, small\\n17\\n\\n\\narms and child soldiers. Austria is working very actively to\\npromote the human security agenda, and I would like to\\nhighlight three priority areas: human rights education, the\\nfight against child pornography and the fight against what\\nthe Secretary-General has aptly termed the uncivil society.\\nOn the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the\\npresence of the United Nations in Vienna next month, we\\nwill organize a high-level meeting on these and other\\naspects of human security.\\nMost threats to human security have a human rights\\ndimension. This is why a human rights security agenda\\nmust include an overall strategy aimed at the strengthening\\nof a worldwide human rights culture. Recent events in\\nKosovo or East Timor have shown that the most basic\\nrights cannot be taken for granted. Again and again we will\\nhave to assert the universality and indivisibility of human\\nrights. We therefore stress the importance of human rights\\neducation, which is essential for the promotion and the\\nachievement of stable and harmonious relations within\\ncountries and among communities. We must redouble our\\nefforts in support of the United Nations Decade for Human\\nRights Education. Next year’s mid-term evaluation of\\nprogress made in the Decade provides an ideal opportunity.\\nInstitutions and organizations with specialized expertise in\\nour countries should identify specific ideas for further\\naction on human rights education activities at national level,\\nin foreign policy, and in the context of development\\ncooperation.\\nEvery man and every woman must know his or her\\nrights in order to become a full and equal member of\\nsociety. People must be provided at the national and the\\ninternational level with effective remedies for human rights\\nviolations. We therefore welcome the successful conclusion\\nof negotiations on the Optional Protocol to the Convention\\non the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\\nWomen. Its adoption by the General Assembly and its early\\nentry into force will have great significance for women\\naround the world.\\nHuman security starts in the smallest entities of our\\nsociety. The mutual learning process within families is one\\nof human beings' most valuable experiences. The family, as\\nthe fundamental unit of society and the natural environment\\nfor the growth and well-being of all of its members, should\\nbe afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that\\nit can fully assume its responsibilities within the\\ncommunity, because it is within the family, first and\\nforemost, where children, the most vulnerable group in\\nsociety, seek support and protection.\\nMillions of children are being exploited worldwide.\\nTheir basic human rights are being denied in many ways.\\nFor some time now, and in particular during the Austrian\\npresidency of the European Union, Vice-Chancellor and\\nForeign Minister Schüssel has been trying to focus\\nattention on one particular aspect: child pornography on\\nthe Internet. Next week, Austria will host an international\\nconference on combating child pornography on the\\nInternet. Organized by Austria, the European Commission\\nand the United States of America, the conference will\\nbring together high-level officials from Ministries of the\\nInterior and Justice, the judiciary and the police, experts\\nfrom international organizations, non-governmental\\norganizations and the industry, especially Internet service\\nproviders. The United Nations system will be represented\\nby experts from the United Nations Children's Fund and\\nthe United Nations Centre for International Crime\\nPrevention. The main objectives of the conference are to\\nreinforce cooperation between law enforcement officials\\nand the judiciary, establish codes of conduct for Internet\\nservice providers and the further development of hotlines\\nand networks between them. The results of this initiative\\nwill be presented to the United Nations.\\nThe fight against drugs and transnational organized\\ncrime has rightly been accorded priority status in the\\nwork of the United Nations. I am glad that the reform\\nmeasures introduced by Secretary-General Kofi Annan\\nhave reaffirmed Vienna's role as the United Nations\\ncentre for fighting uncivil elements in society.\\nAustria is particularly worried by reports about the\\nsituation in Afghanistan, where the areas under poppy\\ncultivation area apparently doubled in 1998. We are\\ntherefore appealing to all partners to enhance their efforts\\nin assisting the United Nations International Drug Control\\nProgramme (UNDCP) to combat the cultivation and\\nproduction of drugs in that region and elsewhere. As a\\npractical contribution to this effort, Austria will sponsor\\na UNDCP training seminar for Central Asian drug\\nauthorities this autumn. Austria strongly believes that drug\\ncontrol is, above all, in the interests of our children and\\nfuture generations.\\nIn April 2000, the first United Nations conference in\\nthe new millennium, the Tenth United Nations Congress\\non the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of\\nOffenders, will take place in Vienna. The key issues\\ncontained in the preliminary draft of the Vienna\\nDeclaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges\\nof the Twenty-First Century (E/1999/30-E/CN.15/1999/12,\\npara. 3), whose final forum will be adopted at the\\n18\\n\\n\\nCongress, address the most burning questions in\\ninternational crime prevention: trafficking in human beings,\\nsmuggling migrants and illicit transfers of firearms.\\nIn this context, I can say with satisfaction that the\\nAustrian initiative to elaborate an international legal\\ninstrument against the smuggling of migrants, which\\nAustria presented to the General Assembly two years ago,\\nhas gathered a great deal of support among United Nations\\nMember States. Currently, intensive negotiations within the\\nframework of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of\\na Convention against Organized Transnational Crime are\\nbeing held and will hopefully be concluded next year with\\nthe adoption of a universal protocol against the smuggling\\nof migrants.\\nThe last of the series of world Conferences in the\\n1990s showed that an innovative yet pragmatic approach\\ncan work. This was the Third United Nations Conference\\non the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,\\nUNISPACE III, which took place in Vienna in July this\\nyear. The Conference focused on the question of how to\\nensure that space technology will benefit humanity in the\\ntwenty-first century and that it is used effectively to\\npromote security in all its forms for the benefit of all\\ncountries. It has provided developing countries with\\nopportunities to define their needs for space applications for\\ndevelopment purposes and to identify ways and possibilities\\nfor them to participate in international programmes which\\ndevelop these applications. UNISPACE III was both a\\nnovel and a successful type of Conference in bringing\\ntogether industry and academia, and young people, as equal\\npartners and incorporating their insights into the final\\ndocuments.\\nIn the twenty-first century, the United Nations and the\\ninternational community will be judged by their capacity to\\nprevent armed conflict. At a time when the world's\\nproblems appear to be growing and the resources to tackle\\nthose problems seem to be shrinking, we must be more\\nstrategic than ever in devising new ways to approach these\\nchallenges.\\nAgain and again we have had to face the fact that the\\ninternational community is not in the position to bridge the\\ngap between early warning and early action. In future,\\nefficient mechanisms will have to be implemented by\\ninternational organizations in order to act at an early stage.\\nIn our response to looming refugee crises, much faster\\naction is needed to avoid human catastrophes like the ones\\nwe have witnessed in Kosovo and East Timor.\\nAs part of its development cooperation concept,\\nAustria is currently working on a comprehensive strategy\\nfor conflict prevention which combines all available\\nmeasures, from facilitation and mediation to a targeted\\nuse of the instruments of development cooperation.\\nAustria is actively involved in the Arusha peace process\\nfor Burundi and is offering a broad range of seminars and\\ntraining programmes on preventive diplomacy, in\\nparticular with its partners in Africa. Austria's\\ndevelopment cooperation aims to promote both\\nsustainable development and sustainable peace.\\nAustria has always lent its active support to United\\nNations efforts to maintain international peace and\\nsecurity. Since 1960, it has been one of the major\\ncontributors to United Nations peacekeeping missions. At\\nthe moment, more than 1,500 Austrian troops, civilian\\npolice, military observers and civilian experts are serving\\nin United Nations peacekeeping, and other United Nations\\nmandated operations, and in missions in which regional\\norganizations are participating — from Kosovo to East\\nTimor, and from Western Sahara to Tajikistan. We will\\ncontinue to do our utmost to assist the United Nations in\\nits efforts to enhance stability in many areas of tension\\naround the world.\\nIf we are to cope with all these challenges, we\\nclearly have to reinforce the rule of law in international\\nrelations. A large part of the legal basis already exists.\\nWhat is needed to make it work is our common political\\nwill to monitor and to ensure its application. This can\\nonly happen in the framework of the United Nations, in\\nparticular through the Security Council.\\nIn view of the United Nations primary responsibility\\nfor the maintenance of peace and security, it is crucial\\nthat the United Nations prove its ability to act quickly and\\ndecisively in conflict situations. The decisive action taken\\nduring the Gulf war in 1990-1991 raised international\\nhopes and expectations for the future.\\nBut already during the terrible conflicts in the\\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia\\nand Herzegovina, it took the Organization much longer to\\nfind a successful crisis solution. It only managed to do so\\nby applying a sensible subcontracting policy with regional\\norganizations. The recent tragedies in Kosovo and East\\nTimor have both brought the United Nations and the\\nSecurity Council to the brink of being perceived in\\ninternational public opinion as ineffective or unable to act.\\n19\\n\\n\\nThe Security Council, which carries the primary\\nresponsibility for international peace and security, must\\nmaintain its ability to act. It cannot be seen to be driven by\\nthe subjective interest of members rather than by an\\nobjective assessment of real requirements. It goes without\\nsaying that the permanent members bear a particular\\nresponsibility in this regard, which includes financial\\nobligations. The privileges of permanent membership come\\nwith a heavy obligation: to act whenever necessary. If a\\npeace operation has to be established, it must not matter\\nwhether the conflict situation is located in an area of little\\nstrategic interest or whether the country in question\\nmaintains unwelcome relations with another entity. Its\\nmandate and size must be based on the conditions on the\\nground, and not depend on anybody’s willingness to finance\\nit. Should the Security Council be seen to be unable to\\nfulfil these functions, we will have to heed the call for\\nreforms, including the role of its permanent members.\\nOn East Timor, the Security Council has finally lived\\nup to its special responsibilities assigned to it under the\\nCharter. This proves that the international community must\\nact decisively when confronted with massive violations of\\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights.\\nAustria welcomes Security Council resolution 1264\\n(1999) authorizing a multinational force for East Timor\\nunder Chapter VII and the commitment of the Indonesian\\nGovernment to cooperate with this force in the\\nimplementation of the mandate. We hope that this initiative\\nwill contribute to bringing about national reconciliation,\\nlasting peace and respect for the will of the people of East\\nTimor, expressed so clearly during the consultations on 30\\nAugust 1999. Austria underlines the necessity to urgently\\nprovide humanitarian assistance, and will also contribute to\\nthese efforts.\\nThe vote on the future of East Timor must be\\nrespected by all sides. Austria, while underlining its desire\\nto see a strong, democratic and united Indonesia, looks\\nforward to recognizing East Timor once the process\\ntowards independence is complete.\\nAustria sharply condemns the atrocities committed in\\nrecent weeks. Those who planned, authorized or executed\\nthese acts must be held individually and personally\\naccountable and be brought to justice.\\nAfter a long impasse the peace process in the Middle\\nEast is back on track. Austria greatly welcomes the\\nmemorandum signed by Israel and the Palestinians at\\nSharm el-Sheikh, which removes the obstacles to the\\nimplementation of the Wye Agreement. Furthermore, we\\nhave taken note with satisfaction that implementation on\\nthe ground has already begun. Here I should especially\\nlike to point to the handing over of territory, the release\\nof Palestinian prisoners and the beginning of the final\\nstatus negotiations. This clear commitment of the parties\\nshould augur well for further speedy progress on the road\\nto peace. Now it will also be necessary to bring about\\nnew momentum in the Syrian/Lebanese track of the peace\\nprocess by relaunching the negotiations between Israel,\\nSyria and Lebanon. I think that all parties agree that\\npeace and mutual understanding are the only viable option\\nfor a prosperous future for all nations in the Middle East\\nregion.\\nThe western Balkans, being geographically so close\\nto Austria, will remain in the foreground of Austrian\\nforeign policy. The most burning problem is currently the\\nsituation in Kosovo, which merits the joint attention of\\nthe international community. I would like to commend the\\nwork which has already been carried out by the United\\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\\n(UNMIK) and by KFOR, and the progress realized so far,\\nin spite of such difficult circumstances. True, in the\\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\\n(1999), and in our efforts to bring Kosovo back to\\nnormalcy, there are delays and setbacks, in particular the\\ninsecurity, the tensions in Kosovska Mitrovica, and the\\nexodus of the majority of Kosovo Serbs and other\\nnon-Albanians. Nevertheless, one must not forget the\\nparamount importance of the Kosovo issue for the\\nstability of the whole Balkan area, which is why we must\\nnot become discouraged when we meet problems. Rather,\\nwe have to understand them as an incentive to redouble\\nour efforts. Yesterday’s demilitarization agreement\\nbetween KFOR and the UCK is, I would say, a very\\nencouraging step in the right direction.\\nIn addition to setting up a functioning civil\\nadministration, including police, creating a democratic\\npolitical atmosphere respectful of human rights,\\nrepatriating over 1 million refugees, and reconstructing\\nthe infrastructure and the economic life of Kosovo, it is\\nUNMIK’s crucial task to facilitate a political process\\nleading to a definite status of the province. This is a very\\ncomplicated endeavour, which requires sound and prudent\\npreparation. We must not try to rush things, since it is\\nclear that stability and reconciliation have to be\\nestablished and solidified before we can tackle the final\\nstatus question.\\n20\\n\\n\\nThe same holds true for Montenegro. We must, and\\nwe will continue to, support the Montenegrin reform\\nprocess, and we must not allow forces in Belgrade to\\nundercut those pluralistic and economic improvements. For\\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole, we will\\ncontinue to work towards democratization, political reform\\nand respect for human and minority rights. Upon such\\nchanges — which are not only urgently necessary but\\nwhich are also yearned for by the Serb and Yugoslav\\npeople — Yugoslavia should, and will, take its rightful\\nplace in the international community.\\nIn spite of some progress made by Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina, it still needs and deserves our intense help —\\nboth politically and financially. At the same time, it is\\nincreasingly necessary for the Bosnians themselves to take\\non more responsibility for their future and to start a process\\nof decoupling themselves from dependency on international\\nassistance.\\nLet me emphasize at this juncture Austria’s strong\\nbelief in the protection and promotion of minorities in\\ngeneral. This attitude is based on historic experience and\\nthe conviction that ethnic minorities constitute a true\\nenrichment of our societies.\\nIt is of interest for the international community to\\nrecall that there are existing successful settlements of\\nimportant minority issues in Europe. In particular, I think\\nof the Austrian minority in the South Tyrol, which today\\nenjoys a well-balanced autonomy on the basis of the Paris\\nTreaty of 1946 between Austria and Italy. Time and again\\nit has been noted that this formula could be an example for\\nthe settlement of minority disputes in other parts of the\\nworld.\\nThough regional organizations and coalitions of the\\nwilling have credibly shown their readiness to take on\\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of international peace\\nand security, the United Nations continues to provide the\\nindispensable political, legal and institutional links to ensure\\nthe acceptance, legitimacy and accountability of their\\nrespective efforts.\\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\\nEurope (OSCE) plays a central role in promoting peace,\\nsecurity and stability in the regional context, in particular\\nthrough its broad range of activities in the area of conflict\\nprevention, crisis management and post-conflict\\nrehabilitation. The broad scope and complex nature of the\\nsecurity challenges in the region requires a pluri-\\ninstitutional response. But that implies also an effective\\ncooperation among the institutions concerned. The OSCE,\\nas a regional arrangement according to Chapter VIII of\\nthe Charter of the United Nations, is closely cooperating\\nwith the United Nations in many fields and regions, such\\nas in Kosovo. In our capacity as the next Chairman-in-\\nOffice of the OSCE, we will continue the efforts to\\nstrengthen the relationship between the OSCE and the\\nUnited Nations at both the political and field levels.\\nLet me conclude by confirming Austria's strong\\ncommitment to the United Nations. In a little less than\\none year, our Heads of State or Government will\\nparticipate in the millennium summit. I hope that this will\\nbe the occasion to unlock the potential of the\\nOrganization. We must use the wonderful tool of our\\nOrganization as it was meant to be used: to ensure our\\nsurvival on this planet in peace, freedom and dignity. On\\nspaceship Earth the supplies are limited, so we have to\\nmake the best possible use of them. Whatever our\\ndifferences, we all know what needs to be done. Let us\\nfind the political will to do it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Speaking to the\\nAssembly one year ago, I demonstrated that the Kingdom\\nof the Netherlands qualified for membership on the Security\\nCouncil. During the elections two weeks later a\\nsubstantial majority of this body supported us, and we are\\ngrateful to them. As the Netherlands has served on the\\nCouncil now for more than eight months and is currently\\nits President, I think it is only fair for me to report to all\\nthe Assembly members who showed confidence in us. I\\nwish to speak on Africa, on the Council, and on shifting\\nour attention from the State to the people.\\nMost of today's armed conflicts are in Africa. From\\nSierra Leone to Eritrea and from the Sudan to the Congo\\nand Angola, Africans are fighting Africans. Fighting\\naccompanies all the plights and pains that are known to\\nhumankind, from poverty and pestilence to famine, fear\\nand flight.\\nAfrica is not a land of troubles alone but also of\\nhappiness, not a continent only of catastrophe but also\\none of hope. The sheer mass of Africa's problems\\nobscures our view of its promise and its potential. In the\\npublic mind, an unbalanced view of Africa prevails. That\\nview, I feel, needs to be corrected: we need to rid\\nourselves of prejudice and think positively. Instead of\\ndejection, we need a deepening commitment. Africa,\\ndespite the odds, has come a long way already.\\nPersonally, I was struck, at the opening of the general\\ndebate, by the sight of an African President of South\\nAfrica, speaking in front of an African President of the\\nGeneral Assembly, seated next to an African Secretary-\\nGeneral. It is hard to miss the symbolism of that image.\\nIt is one image the founding fathers of this Organization\\nmight not have had, one image that by itself already holds\\na promise for the future: the next century may well be the\\ncentury of Africa.\\nThe Secretary-General, in his report on Africa, has\\nmade a link between conflict and prosperity. For this\\nreason, my delegation felt that members of the Council\\nwould be well advised to consider this question in some\\ndepth, and, in our presidential capacity, we have therefore\\norganized an open-ended public debate, to be held next\\nweek, in which the Secretary-General will brief us on the\\nstate of Africa.\\nLet me now turn to the question of how to improve\\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations, and the Security\\nCouncil in particular, in coping with crisis situations. On\\nmany occasions in its lifetime, I have admired the United\\nNations for the way it intervened in emergencies. In\\nparticular, the Office of the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United\\nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food\\n21\\n\\n\\nProgramme have enjoyed a long tradition of being in the\\nforefront. Many non-governmental organizations, such as\\nMédecins Sans Frontières and the International Committee\\nof the Red Cross (ICRC), have stood there right beside\\nthem.\\nLet me pose a number of questions on how the\\nSecurity Council performs in emergencies. First, do we not\\nsee a crisis coming before it breaks? Do we not have early\\nwarning systems? Of course we do. The call for\\nestablishing early warning systems has been around for\\ndecades; it has become a buzzword used whenever the\\ninadequacies of the United Nations response machinery are\\nbeing discussed. But in fact, given the level of\\ncommunications in modern times, policy planners have\\nplenty of information to be forward-looking. It is not the\\nfailing of an early warning system that can be put to blame,\\nnor the lack of data. It is, instead, the failure of decision-\\nmakers to react adequately.\\nSecond question: Why, then, does the United Nations\\nreact inadequately? Do we not have preventive diplomacy?\\nWe do, not only in terms of bilateral efforts of major\\nnations or of the good offices of the Secretary-General; the\\nCouncil itself can be proactive. The recent mission it\\ndispatched to East Timor is a good example of how the\\nCouncil can be more assertive. Missions are an existing\\ninstrument that is, in my opinion, in need of an upgrade. In\\naddition, the open debate on East Timor in the Council, at\\nwhich everybody spoke plain language, fuelled the\\nmounting international pressure on Indonesia.\\nThird question: Is the problem, perhaps, the veto? I\\nknow this is a popular view, but it is also a tenuous one.\\nTrue, we cannot ignore the veto as a factor in the Council's\\nperformance record. True again, in our discussions on\\nreform of the Council, the veto is a core element we will\\none day have to come to grips with. Yet, the problem is an\\nintractable one. Tampering with the veto may itself create\\nthe risk of dissolution for the United Nations as a whole.\\nThe very fact that a single Member State can hold the\\nentire world community in limbo in the face of harrowing\\nbrutalities is affecting the stature and moral force of the\\nOrganization. That, too, may be spawning dissolution. It\\nmay be argued that, without the veto, the United Nations\\nwould not have survived its first 50 years. It may also be\\nargued that, with the veto, the United Nations will not\\nsurvive the next 50 years. In the first 50 years, the\\nOrganization might have fallen apart if the veto had not\\nbeen there as a buffer against the push and pull of a bipolar\\nworld. In the second 50 years, in a multipolar world,\\nrepeated inaction by the Security Council would result in\\nparallel actions outside the United Nations framework,\\npushing the Organization, as a custodian of world peace,\\nmore and more into the margins.\\nNo matter when or how the debate on the veto will\\nend, this Assembly should meanwhile call on those who\\npossess it to exercise maximum restraint, particularly in\\nhumanitarian emergencies. I concur with my German\\ncolleague that the permanent five are duty-bound to\\nexplain to the world why they are blocking action by the\\nCouncil. Moreover, we might consider a situation in\\nwhich a negative vote by a permanent member does not\\nin itself block action.\\nFourth question: Does the problem lie in the political\\nwill, perhaps? To simply say that the political will has\\nbeen lacking is not only a platitude, but also a very partial\\nview of reality. For part of that reality is that images of\\nall the conflicts on the globe travel around the world with\\nthe speed of light. The media broadcasts live images of\\nhuman suffering. Understandably, such images rouse\\nindignation and horror among millions of viewers. They\\nexpect instant action. As people are being better informed\\nabout current events, their level of expectation rises. The\\ngap between what is expected and what is possible\\nbecomes more visible and more acute. By contrast,\\ndiplomacy comes with tools that may be old and\\nrespectable, but are also solid and slow. And so, while in\\na globalizing world human misery is disseminated along\\nthe electronic highway, diplomacy today still proceeds\\nalong a footpath.\\nThis leaves me with the central question: Why is the\\nCouncil often running behind reality? How can we make\\nit catch up with developments?\\nAs I look back at the general debate this week, I\\nthink that we are getting very close to identifying the\\nmain obstacle. I know that many interventions share a\\ncommon element — they compare the notion of\\nsovereignty to that of human rights and territorial integrity\\nto humanitarian intervention. To be sure, the question per\\nse is as old as the Charter itself. What is new is the\\nvenue. I cannot recall that Foreign Ministers at the\\nGeneral Assembly have talked about this question at any\\nlength before. I strongly believe that this issue was bound\\nto surface at this level at some point or another.\\nIn 1945, the architects of this Organization included\\ntwo contradictory premises: respect for territorial integrity\\nand political independence, on the one hand; and respect\\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms, on the other.\\n22\\n\\n\\nThe world in those days was ruled by Governments alone,\\nand so the United Nations was made up of States. At the\\ntime, the notion of human rights, although grafted onto the\\nCharter with much conviction, was essentially at odds with\\nclassical legal thinking. In a way, the tension became even\\nmore pronounced at the adoption of the Universal\\nDeclaration. After all, for half a millennium the notion of\\nsovereignty had served as the basis of our global political\\narchitecture. As the idea was enshrined in the Charter, the\\nfounding fathers believed it would stand the test of time.\\nBy contrast, the idea of human rights in international\\nrelations was, for the most part, a post-war novelty. Indeed,\\nthe Charter is much more specific on respect for\\nsovereignty than on respect for human rights.\\nSince 1945, the world has witnessed a gradual shift in\\nthat balance, making respect for human rights more and\\nmore mandatory and respect for sovereignty less and less\\nstringent. An elaborate body of international human rights\\nlaw has come to counterbalance the dictates of paragraphs\\n4 and 7 of Article 2. Today, human rights have come to\\noutrank sovereignty. Increasingly, the prevailing\\ninterpretation of the Charter is that it aims to protect\\nindividual human beings, not to protect those who abuse\\nthem. Today, we regard it as a generally accepted rule of\\ninternational law that no sovereign State has the right to\\nterrorize its own citizens. Indeed, if the Charter were to be\\nwritten today, there would be an Article 2.8 saying that\\nnothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize\\nMember States to terrorize their own people.\\nLet me go one step further. The blurring of the\\nboundaries of sovereignty does not stop at human rights. In\\nthe future, the notion of sovereignty is going to be tested\\nbeyond that. Think of decrepit nuclear installations, massive\\ndamage to the environment, lack of water or mass\\nmarketing of narcotic drugs. Can responsible statesmen\\nafford to wait until the damage is actually done? Or do they\\nin fact have a duty to prevent it? These are questions\\nwhich, at some point, the Security Council will have to be\\ninvolved in.\\nIt is not the lack of early warning, not the absence of\\npreventive diplomacy, not the veto per se. I call on every\\npolitician and every diplomat in this room to accept that the\\ntraditional balance between sovereignty and human rights,\\nbetween the State and the people is shifting. I am\\nconvinced this is one of the paramount issues of our time.\\nMomentum is building, and we should seize it. Let us put\\nthe issue squarely on the agenda: the agenda of the\\nUnited Nations, of the Council and of our parliaments at\\nhome. I ask the legal community to keep a keen eye on\\nthe groundswell that is developing and to be innovative in\\nits thinking. We politicians have a vast responsibility\\nhere. We should steer the discussion towards the people\\ninstead of the State.\\nThe Security Council should be stronger, not weaker.\\nIt should be a credible leader in the maintenance of\\npeace. In order to be credible, it must be consistent, swift\\nand proactive. It must show courage, drive and vision. It\\nmust keep changing with the times. It must put people\\nover politics. That is a tall order. Its decision on East\\nTimor gave us hope for the Council's potential.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"First of all, I would like\\nto warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\\nAssembly and to wish you every success in this difficult\\noffice.\\nI should also like to thank Foreign Minister Opertti for\\nhis tireless dedication in successfully presiding over the\\nfifty-third session of the General Assembly.\\nI welcome Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga, with which\\nGermany has long enjoyed friendly ties, as new Members\\nof the world Organization.\\nI endorse the statement of my Finnish colleague, Tarja\\nHalonen, on behalf of the European Union.\\nThis session of the General Assembly is the last in\\nthis “century of extremes”, as the British historian Eric\\nHobsbawm called the century now drawing to a close. That\\nis reason enough to take stock. Since its foundation, the\\nUnited Nations has greatly enhanced relations between\\npeoples. The development of international law, protection\\nof human rights, decolonization, worldwide humanitarian\\nand disaster aid, arousing awareness of the great problems\\nfacing mankind, such as population growth, poverty and the\\nglobal environmental crisis — all of this would be\\ninconceivable without the United Nations.\\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations\\nobjectives and values — peace, human rights, freedom,\\njustice and development — and they have gained\\nworldwide recognition, even if, unfortunately, they are not\\nalways respected everywhere. Nevertheless, even after more\\nthan 50 years, there is still a long way to go before they are\\nuniversally respected and implemented. Despite all its\\nefforts, the international community has not yet succeeded\\nin ridding our planet of war, oppression, tyranny, expulsion\\nand grave human rights violations, including genocide. At\\nthe close of this century, the United Nations and its\\nMember States are unable to fully master their core task,\\nnamely, safeguarding peace and security. The great hope\\nthat following the end of the East-West conflict the era of\\nmultilateral cooperation and worldwide rule of law would\\ndawn has not yet come to fruition.\\nToday the question of peacekeeping must be\\nconsidered under conditions very different to those during\\nthe United Nations early years. First, most conflicts today\\nare internal rather than international, as in earlier times.\\nSecondly, the role of the nation State has been\\nconsiderably relativized by the increased importance of\\nhuman rights and the globalization of the economy and\\nsociety. Against this background, the question of\\npeacekeeping arises more and more in an area of tension\\nbetween traditional State sovereignty and protection of\\nhuman rights.\\nWhat is to be done when entire States collapse and\\nthe civilian population is massacred in never-ending civil\\nwars from all sides? What if ethnic tensions in a State are\\npartly provoked by criminal Governments, which then\\nrespond with pogroms, mass expulsions and mass\\nmurders, even genocide? Should the United Nations then\\nregard State sovereignty as more important than\\nprotection of individuals and their rights? Rwanda,\\nKosovo and East Timor are dramatic examples of this.\\nIn many ways, therefore, the Kosovo conflict\\nrepresents a turning point. The international community\\ncould no longer tolerate a State waging war against its\\nown people and using terror and expulsion as a political\\ninstrument. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his\\nbrilliant and trail-blazing speech to the fifty-fifth session\\nof the Commission on Human Rights, no Government has\\nthe right to use the cover of the principle of State\\nsovereignty to violate human rights. Non-interference in\\ninternal affairs must no longer be misused as a shield for\\ndictators and murderers. The World Conference on\\nHuman Rights in Vienna reaffirmed this in 1993, with the\\napproval of all United Nations Members States, with the\\nwords:\\n“the promotion and protection of all human rights is\\na legitimate concern of the international\\ncommunity”. (Vienna Declaration and Programme\\nof Action, I, para. 4)\\nHowever, the Kosovo conflict also marks a change\\nof direction in the development of international relations.\\nHow will the international community decide in the\\nfuture — this question has just been raised once more in\\nEast Timor — when it comes to preventing massive\\nhuman rights violations against an entire people? Two\\ndevelopments are conceivable.\\n\\n\\n\\nA practice of humanitarian interventions could evolve\\noutside the United Nations system. This would be a very\\nproblematic development. The intervention in Kosovo,\\nwhich took place in a situation where the Security Council\\nhad tied its own hands after all efforts to find a peaceful\\nsolution had failed, was intended to provide emergency\\nassistance and, ultimately, to protect the displaced Kosovo\\nAlbanians. The unity of the European States and the\\nWestern Alliance, as well as various Security Council\\nresolutions, were of crucial significance here. However, this\\nstep, which is only justified in this special situation, must\\nnot set a precedent for weakening the United Nations\\nSecurity Council's monopoly on authorizing the use of legal\\ninternational force. Nor must it become a licence to use\\nexternal force under the pretext of humanitarian assistance.\\nThis would open the door to the arbitrary use of power and\\nanarchy and throw the world back to the nineteenth century.\\nThe only solution to this dilemma, therefore, is to\\nfurther develop the existing United Nations system in such\\na way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time\\nin cases of very grave human rights violations, but not until\\nall means of settling conflicts peacefully have been\\nexhausted and — this is a crucial point — within a strictly\\nlimited legal and controlled framework.\\nIn the twenty-first century the individual and his rights\\nmust take a more prominent place alongside the rights of\\nStates in the concept of security as defined by the\\ninternational community. The reform of the Security\\nCouncil, the central body for safeguarding world peace,\\nmust be oriented towards this principle. The Security\\nCouncil is, in fact, authorized to act, and able to do so,\\nwhere peace or security are at risk due to internal\\ndevelopments. This has been demonstrated by a long chain\\nof decisions, from the apartheid resolution to the\\ninterventions in Iraq, Bosnia and Haiti. However, in\\nRwanda, Kosovo and the Congo, decision making in the\\nSecurity Council was blocked, thus rendering it unable to\\nlive up to its responsibilities enshrined in the United\\nNations Charter, with disastrous results for the peoples in\\nquestion.\\nThese conflicts are a pressing reason, particularly in\\nview of the important Millennium General Assembly, to\\nfinally carry out the long-overdue substantial reform of the\\nSecurity Council. The Security Council must be adapted to\\nthe new realities of the global political situation. It must\\nhave a more representative composition and, above all, it\\nmust be equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of\\ntoday. Reform must involve enlargement to include both\\nmore permanent and non-permanent members, as well as a\\nstrengthening of its decision-making powers. As the\\nAssembly knows, Germany has for some time now\\nexpressed its willingness to assume more and lasting\\nresponsibility in this connection. We stand by this\\nunreservedly.\\nIn the debate on reform we must not avoid the issue\\nof the permanent members' right of veto, a question of\\nkey importance for the Security Council's capability to\\nact. The right of veto is regarded by many as outdated in\\nits current form. However, it is a situation with which we\\nhave to reckon internationally for a long time to come.\\nHow then can decision-making in the Security Council be\\nmade more efficient?\\nAccording to the Charter, the Security Council acts\\nwith the mandate, and on behalf, of all United Nations\\nMember States. But hitherto they have not been entitled\\nto learn why a State has exercised its right of veto. This\\nis not only neither democratic nor transparent, but also\\nmakes it easier for States to veto a draft resolution\\nunilaterally for national rather than international interests.\\nThe introduction of an obligation for a State to explain to\\nthe General Assembly why it is vetoing a draft resolution\\nwould make it more difficult to do so and thus bring\\nabout substantial progress towards using the right of veto\\nmore responsibly. Why should not the General Assembly\\nassume more responsibility in the future, too?\\nA second approach to making the international\\npeacekeeping system more efficient would be via Chapter\\nVIII of the United Nations Charter, namely by\\nstrengthening the regional security systems and\\nredistributing tasks and areas of responsibility among\\nthem and the United Nations. It is becoming clear that the\\nregional organizations could be allocated an even greater\\nimplementation role. This would also foster the\\ncapabilities of regional organizations to engage in security\\ncooperation, as well as their collaboration with the United\\nNations. However, the primacy of the Security Council\\nremains absolutely essential.\\nWithout reforms in the area of peacekeeping, the\\nSecurity Council will be circumvented more and more\\nfrequently, resulting in the erosion of the Security Council\\nand, ultimately, of the entire United Nations system. The\\nUnited Nations, one of civilization's greatest achievements\\nthis century, as well as the values and principles it\\nrepresents, would thus be at risk of subsiding into\\ninsignificance. We must prevent that.\\n12\\n\\n\\nThe disaster in East Timor is currently demonstrating\\nhow necessary close cooperation is between a Security\\nCouncil capable of taking action and the countries in the\\nregion. The Security Council's mandate to send a\\nmultilateral peacekeeping force must be fully implemented.\\nIndonesia must now cooperate closely with the United\\nNations Mission and do everything in its power to\\nguarantee its success. The bloodshed must end. The victims\\nmust be helped. Those displaced must be able to return\\nhome safely. Germany has already provided humanitarian\\nand food aid. We will send a medical corps to assist the\\npeacekeeping troops and make further contributions towards\\nrebuilding the destroyed country. I am confident that our\\nParliament will lend this plan its full backing.\\nIn Africa, the Great Lakes region, the Congo and\\nSierra Leone have for many years been the scene of terrible\\nwars, mass murders, destruction and much suffering on the\\npart of refugees. The Organization of African Unity (OAU)\\nand the Economic Community of West African States\\n(ECOWAS) and its Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) have\\ndone much to contain and resolve these conflicts. However,\\nthese organizations also need the support of the United\\nNations, in Sierra Leone, in the Congo and, in particular, in\\nthe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both parties to\\nthe conflict must observe the agreements concluded and\\nwork closely together with the United Nations and the OAU\\nso that the peace process now begun can be brought to a\\nsuccessful conclusion.\\nThe international community must focus on the causes\\nrather than merely the symptoms of wars and conflicts in\\nthe context of multilateral peacekeeping. Secretary-General\\nKofi Annan rightly called for a “culture of prevention” to\\nbe developed in order to prevent the outbreak of wars and\\navert natural disasters more effectively in future.\\nEveryone knows how difficult the transition from the\\n“culture of reaction” to the “culture of prevention” will be.\\nIt takes a lot of persuading to summon up the political and\\neconomic will for measures intended to prevent something\\nwhich we hope will never happen. However, on financial\\ngrounds and, above all, on humanitarian grounds, it is our\\nduty and responsibility to revise our thinking here. Progress\\nis urgently required in four areas.\\nFirst, we must move on from early warning to early\\nresponse. The United Nations has considerable resources at\\nits disposal for preventive diplomacy, which must be used\\neven more. There is also a great potential for synergy in\\ncooperation with non-governmental organizations.\\nSecondly, peacekeeping operations must be carried\\nout before conflicts erupt. The United Nations mission in\\nMacedonia has set a standard in this respect.\\nThirdly, disarmament and the non-proliferation of\\nmeans of mass destruction are in need of fresh political\\nimpetus. It is essential that the Geneva negotiations gain\\nmomentum, particularly in the fields of global nuclear\\ndisarmament and the verification of biological weapons,\\nand in the implementation of the Chemical Weapons\\nConvention. Furthermore, Germany advocates the\\nadoption of a convention on preventing the illegal transfer\\nof small arms worldwide.\\nFourthly, peace-building is a prevention task of\\ngrowing importance. With the United Nations Interim\\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the United\\nNations is facing one of the most comprehensive tests in\\nits history. Building public order by creating an efficient\\njudicial system and quickly sending the pledged\\ninternational police units is now crucial. Since the United\\nNations began incorporating national police units in the\\ninternational standby system, they have been able to act\\nmore swiftly. We must continue along this path.\\nProtection of human rights and the growing\\ndemocratization of States form the basis for a preventive\\npeace policy and civil conflict management. It is a\\nhistorical fact that democracies with a well-developed\\ncivil society hardly ever wage war against each other.\\nLasting economic success cannot be achieved in the\\nglobalized information society of tomorrow without good\\ngovernance founded on human rights, the separation of\\npowers and a functioning legal and constitutional\\nframework.\\nIn the field of human rights, welcome progress has\\nbeen made towards broadening the legal basis for\\ninternational relations, particularly during the last year.\\nThe detention of Pinochet and the indictment of Milosevic\\nby the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\\nYugoslavia are milestones along the path towards creating\\na world in which the rule of law prevails. In future,\\ndictators and perpetrators of human rights violations will\\nno longer be able to rely on not being called to account\\nfor their actions. This must also apply to the murderers of\\nDili and those who issued the orders. Just like everywhere\\nelse in the world, internal peace is contingent upon\\njustice.\\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\\nCriminal Court represented a quantum leap in the\\n13\\n\\n\\ndevelopment of international law. I call upon all States to\\nrespect the integrity of the Rome Statute, to sign it and to\\nswiftly ratify it, so that the Court can commence work next\\nyear.\\nGermany is doing all it can to bring about progress in\\nthe following fields of human rights. The heinous crimes of\\nchild trafficking and child prostitution must be banned\\nthroughout the world, as must the use of child soldiers. In\\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of\\nthe Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts,\\nthe age limit must be raised to 18.\\nIn many countries women are still largely without\\nrights and protection and subjected to discrimination and\\nviolence. This is an unacceptable injustice. Unfortunately,\\nour world is still a long way from genuine equality, even\\nwith regard to fundamental rights. We must therefore aim\\nto adopt the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the\\nElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.\\nIn our view, the death penalty cannot be justified\\neither ethically or legally. Together with its European\\npartners, Germany will therefore continue to vigorously\\nwork towards ensuring the implementation of the joint\\nresolution on abolishing the death penalty.\\nProtection of press freedom must be improved. The\\nfreedom to inform is a reliable gauge of respect for human\\nrights. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights guarantees the right to freedom of opinion.\\nHowever, censorship, intimidation and reprisals are the\\norder of the day in many countries. It is particularly\\nshocking that year after year dozens of journalists are killed\\nwhile on assignment. The United Nations should take a\\ncloser look at this issue and consider practical solutions as\\nwell as enhance legal protection for journalists. To this end\\nwe will shortly be extending invitations to a conference to\\nbe held in Germany.\\nThe United Nations third major task alongside\\npeacekeeping and promoting human rights in the coming\\ncentury will be to bring about a reconciliation between rich\\nand poor countries.\\nThe tenth Human Development Report of the United\\nNations Development Programme came to the sad\\nconclusion that globalization has further widened the gap\\nbetween rich and poor countries. The international\\ncommunity must endeavour to counter this trend. The\\ndevelopment of the poorer and the poorest countries must\\nnot be left to the invisible hand of the global market. The\\nindividual, not the market, must be the focus of the\\nglobalization debate. This will also require greater\\nsteering at the political level.\\nThe rich countries have a responsibility to help poor\\ncountries take advantage of globalization and enable them\\nto have a fairer share of the world economy by assisting\\nthem with internal reforms and by opening up markets.\\nWithin the framework of its European Union and Group\\nof 8 presidencies, Germany launched substantial\\ninitiatives, which must be further developed in the form\\nof the 1999 Köln Debt Initiative and the commencement\\nof negotiations on a follow-up arrangement for the Lomé\\nConvention.\\nDevelopment cooperation in the broadest sense must\\nbecome one of the United Nations core tasks to a greater\\ndegree than hitherto. Science and technology are geared\\nfar too much to the problems of rich countries. Why do\\nwe not make greater use of the United Nations framework\\nto build bridges here? The economist Jeffrey Sachs made\\nthe interesting suggestion, for example, that a millennium\\nvaccine fund could be established, with guaranteed\\nmarkets in the future for vaccines against tropical viruses\\nsuch as tuberculosis, malaria and, above all, AIDS.\\nFurthermore, in the context of the emergence of a global\\nknowledge society, the international regime for the\\nprotection of intellectual property must be revised in order\\nto ensure that the world’s poor do not lose a large part of\\ntheir rights and freedoms in the near future. Rich and\\npoor countries should get together with one another more\\nfrequently to discuss such proposals. During its\\npresidency of the Group of Eight, Germany made a start\\nby meeting the non-aligned countries and the Group of\\n77.\\nThe destruction of the environment has long since\\nceased to be a soft issue, but, rather, has become a very\\nhard question which will have an increasingly strong\\nimpact on international security. According to the new\\nstudy by the United Nations Environment Programme\\n(UNEP), global warming and water shortages will be the\\nbiggest problems facing humanity in the coming century.\\nUNEP also rightly draws attention to the close connection\\nbetween environmental destruction, poverty and excessive\\nconsumption. The deadlock in the climate protection\\nnegotiations must finally be overcome and the Kyoto\\nProtocol implemented. The destruction of the rain forest\\nmust be stopped and further desertification prevented, and\\nwe must halt the squandering of our planet’s natural\\nresources and switch to renewable energy as quickly as\\npossible. The world does not have much time left to\\n14\\n\\n\\nremap a course towards sustainability. This will also require\\na much more active population policy, including a\\nlong-term strategy to deal with the ageing of our world’s\\npopulation. The International Plan of Action on Ageing,\\nadopted in 1982, is in need of urgent revision. We intend\\nto hold a ministerial conference in Germany on this issue\\nunder the auspices of the Economic Commission for\\nEurope.\\nWith the leap into the next millennium, the nation\\nState principle will continue to diminish in importance. It\\nwill no longer be possible to find answers to major global\\nproblems within the framework of the traditional nation\\nstate. Rather, this will take place in a strengthened\\ninternational structure and with a transfer of power to\\ninternational organizations, with the United Nations at their\\nhead. This will entail a transformation of traditional power\\ninto justice, the reconciliation of interests and a greater role\\nfor civil society in the international political system, with\\nthe ever-greater involvement of representatives of civil\\nsociety and industry. Reaching agreement on minimum\\nstandards with regard to social issues — on the issue of\\nchild labour, for example — will be possible in many cases\\nonly in a global context. I support the proposal put forward\\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on\\ncommon values and principles be concluded within the\\nframework of a public/private partnership, between the\\nUnited Nations and major companies, in order to lend the\\nlaw of the market a human face.\\nThe United Nations must become the core of effective\\nglobal governance. Strengthening the United Nations, which\\nmust begin by guaranteeing its financial basis, is therefore\\none of Germany’s most important foreign policy objectives.\\nDuring the past 50 years, and for the first time in its\\nhistory, Germany has been opting wholeheartedly for\\nintegration into multilateral structures, thereby achieving\\ndemocracy, freedom and reunification. Today, out of a\\nsense of deep conviction and historical responsibility, our\\ncountry is committed to peaceful reconciliation of interests\\nand to multilateralism. We are taking this conviction with\\nus to our old and new capital, Berlin. In the international\\nState system of tomorrow the answer to the challenges of\\nglobalization will come from multilateralism alone. Our\\nworld will always be plural, and no form of unilateralism\\ncan therefore work in the long run. For that reason, the\\ntwenty-first century, with its more than 6 billion people and\\ntheir States, will need a United Nations that is capable of\\ntaking action. The United Nations and its Members can\\ntherefore be certain that we Germans will be their\\nstaunchest allies in the efforts to strengthen the United\\nNations.\\n\\n\\n\", \"First of all, let\\nme say how satisfied I am about this week's decision of\\nour 14 European Union (EU) partners to lift the\\nmeasures implemented on 31 January against Austria.\\nThis is a victory for reason, and it is also a victory for\\nEurope. In the last seven and a half months — a very\\ndifficult time, I must say — the United Nations has\\nstood by us. Austria treasures this support. The United\\nNations has had confidence in our firm commitment to\\nuniversal standards and values. The report of the “three\\nwise men”, Martti Ahtisaari, Marcelino Oreja and\\nJochen Frowein, comes to the same conclusion. Austria\\nwill continue its role as an active, reliable and\\nconstructive Member State of the United Nations.\\nAustria expects to resume fully its formal and\\ninformal work within the European Union. This is\\nabsolutely crucial in view of the important projects that\\nlie ahead of us: first, the reform of the institutions of\\nthe European Union and, secondly, the enlargement of\\nthe Union, a matter of great importance and a historic\\nresponsibility. An enlarged Union will bolster\\nEuropean stability and prosperity. Its benefits will\\nreach beyond Europe. Austria, as a country in the heart\\nof Europe, will fully support and, in its own interest,\\naccelerate the process of enlargement.\\nSince this fifty-fifth session of the General\\nAssembly coincides with the turn of the millennium,\\nwe ought to undertake a broader examination of today's\\nworld. We ought to design policies of a long-term\\nnature. All too often we have to cope with\\ncontradictions when engaging in day-to-day politics\\nand when rapidly responding to crises on the one hand\\nand addressing sustainable societal development on the\\nother. A great number of our decisions taken today\\nhave important implications for future policy options.\\nGenerations to come will have to bear the cost, and\\nthey will enjoy the benefits of our policies.\\nIt is in this context that I wish to pay tribute to\\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\\nclairvoyance and leadership. His millennium report\\nembraces a balanced analysis of the challenges the\\ninternational community faces today, and it offers\\nconcrete, accomplishable and far-sighted\\nrecommendations. Austria welcomes this road map for\\nthe future course of United Nations activities and will\\nfollow its guidelines.\\nFurthermore, Austria supports the timely\\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to mandate a\\ncomprehensive review of peacekeeping operations in\\nall their aspects. Since the environment for complex\\npeace operations has become more challenging than\\never before, Austria, as a major troop contributor,\\nwelcomes the report and the recommendations drawn\\n17\\n\\nup by a group of experts under the leadership of\\nMr. Brahimi. We are ready to support their\\nimplementation.\\nAs Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for\\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I wish to\\noutline a number of major achievements of the OSCE\\nduring this year. The OSCE serves as the primary\\nforum for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis\\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation in my\\nregion. This year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth\\nanniversary of the Helsinki Final Act. This truly\\nhistoric document initiated the Helsinki Process, from\\nwhich we still draw valid lessons for our common\\nefforts to achieve “freedom from fear”, to use this vivid\\nnotion from the report of the Secretary-General\\n(A/54/2000, para. 65). Security and stability through\\ncooperation and the effective protection of human\\nrights within each country have a direct bearing on\\ninternational peace and security. The fundamental\\nsignificance of democracy, human rights and strong\\ncivil societies has been affirmed in the Charter on\\nEuropean Security adopted by the OSCE participating\\nStates last year in Istanbul.\\nThe OSCE has proved to be a flexible institution,\\nadapting itself to the far-reaching changes in the\\npolitical landscape of Europe after the fall of the Iron\\nCurtain. Over the past decade, it has evolved into a\\nvibrant organization with a network of as many as 20\\nfield operations.\\nNot only in South-Eastern Europe and Central\\nAsia, on which I will elaborate later, but also in other\\nparts of the OSCE area, we have been able to achieve\\nconcrete results in our continuing efforts for peace and\\nstability. As to conflict prevention, I would like to\\nmention the successful observation mission of the\\nOSCE at the border between Georgia and the Chechen\\nRepublic of the Russian Federation. We can also\\nregister some positive developments concerning the\\npolitical resolution of “frozen conflicts” in Georgia and\\nin Moldova — conflicts which are often outside the\\nspotlight of broader public attention but nevertheless\\nhave a highly destabilizing impact on the region and\\nbeyond. Through my frequent travels as Chairperson-\\nin-Office, I wish to enhance the political awareness\\nregarding these unresolved or potential conflicts and\\nsecurity risks. The conflict situation in Chechnya\\nremains unresolved and a matter of great concern.\\nLet me mention an achievement in the\\ninstitutional field. An important step in enhancing the\\ncivilian crisis management capability of the OSCE was\\nset with the establishment of the Rapid Expert\\nAssistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT), a\\nprogramme which should speed up the deployment of\\nhighly trained civilian experts to the field.\\nWhat are the specific challenges the OSCE is\\ncurrently facing in the prevention, settlement and\\nmanagement of conflicts? In South-Eastern Europe the\\nwork of the Organization focuses in particular on the\\nstrengthening of democracy, post-crisis rehabilitation,\\nthe rule of law and civil society. The promotion of free\\nand fair elections plays a key role in achieving these\\ngoals. The OSCE is tasked with organizing local\\nelections in Kosovo at the end of October this year and,\\nonly two weeks thereafter, of general elections in\\nBosnia and Herzegovina. In Kosovo, the OSCE has\\nbeen involved in the complex task of civil and voter\\nregistration, which resulted in more than 1 million\\nregistrations. I note with regret that the Kosovo Serbs\\ndid not participate in the registration process and that\\nBelgrade would not allow the registration of Kosovo\\nSerbs in Serbia. The OSCE, however, will continue its\\nefforts to bring about active participation of the\\nKosovo Serbs in democratic political life. We will not\\nlose sight of our common goal of a pluri-ethnic\\nKosovo.\\nKosovo is an excellent example of the new\\nquality of the cooperation between the United Nations\\nand the OSCE as a distinct component within the\\noverall framework of the United Nations Interim\\nAdministration.\\nA central goal of Austria's chairmanship of the\\nOSCE is to give equal attention to current, and often\\nlong-standing, conflicts as well as to potential security\\nrisks. In the pursuit of this policy, we support the\\nexplicit goal of the OSCE to create a common security\\nspace. This implies a strong focus on the Caucasus\\nregion and on Central Asia. The OSCE effectively\\ncontributes to the alleviation of the suffering of the\\ncivilian population in this region, the promotion of\\npolitical dialogue between warring parties and the\\nmonitoring of post-conflict arrangements through\\nobserver missions.\\nConflict prevention is key to the work of the\\nOSCE in Central Asia. During my most recent visit to\\nthe region, I obtained a first-hand impression of its\\n18\\n\\nsecurity problems. In addition to the destabilizing\\neffects of the precarious situation in Afghanistan, the\\nCentral Asian region faces manifold transnational\\nthreats, such as terrorism, organized crime, illegal arms\\nand drug trafficking and the degradation of the\\nenvironment, as well as violent extremism and\\nreligious fundamentalism.\\nThe OSCE is well placed to support the Central\\nAsian States in their common efforts to deal effectively\\nwith these multiple challenges to their security. It acts\\nas a political catalyst supporting the efforts of other,\\nspecialized international actors. The international\\nconference, jointly prepared by the OSCE\\nChairmanship and the United Nations Office for Drug\\nControl and Crime Prevention, on the issues of drugs,\\norganized crime and terrorism, to be held in Tashkent\\non 19 and 20 October is only one example.\\nI cannot but re-emphasize the importance of the\\nhuman dimension in the work of the OSCE. In the\\ncourse of this year we have focused our work on a\\nnumber of abhorrent facets of civil unrest, such as\\nchildren in armed conflict, the proliferation of small\\narms and the trafficking in human beings, particularly\\nwomen and girls. It is in this context that I would like\\nto highlight the recent adoption of a comprehensive\\nAction Plan for Gender Issues, which will guide the\\nOSCE in its commitment to advance equality between\\nwomen and men and to protect the human rights of\\nwomen and girls in the region.\\nIf we analyse the profound changes that have\\noccurred in the recent past, we note that the individual\\ncitizen has gained in prominence not only as an actor in\\nour democratic societies, with growing responsibilities\\nin relation to the social, environmental and economic\\nsustainability of our development, but as a victim of\\nnew threats to security.\\nIt is noteworthy that the United Nations, the\\nGroup of Eight and the OSCE have increasingly moved\\naction against terrorism, drug abuse and crime to the\\ntop of their agendas. I am pleased to point out that the\\nnegotiations on a Convention against Transnational\\nOrganized Crime, which were held at United Nations\\nHeadquarters in Vienna over the past two years, led to\\na successful outcome in the course of this summer. We\\nare confident that the three additional protocols — on\\ntrafficking in and smuggling of persons as well as on\\ntrafficking in firearms — will be concluded this fall.\\nAustria, in any case, will strive for a rapid entry into\\nforce and implementation of these important legal\\ninstruments. We are pleased that the United Nations\\nCentre for International Crime Prevention will serve as\\nthe secretariat for the Conference of the Parties. I stress\\nthat my country is ready to join forces with our\\npartners in the developing world to counter organized\\ncrime in all its facets.\\nThanks to the human development reports of the\\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), our\\nunderstanding of development has shifted from macro-\\neconomic statistics to a more human-centred concept,\\ndefining development as a process of broadening the\\nspectrum of choice, both of the individual human being\\nand of society at large. I am pleased that the Human\\nDevelopment Report 2000 underlines the\\ninterrelatedness between human development and\\nhuman rights. In short, the Report concludes that\\nhuman development is an essential precondition for the\\nrealization of human rights. Human rights, in turn, are\\nan essential prerequisite for comprehensive human\\ndevelopment.\\nIf, however, we accept that most challenges to\\nhuman security have a human rights dimension, we\\nmay wish to take a new and more operational look at\\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. How can\\nwe make our human rights regimes more effective in\\nour societies? The Secretary-General has shown us the\\npath to follow, saying:\\n“it is the poison of ignorance, all too frequently,\\nthat lies at the heart of human rights violations,\\nknowledge provides an antidote”. (Press release\\nSG/SM/6829, 10 December 1998)\\nUltimately, it will be citizens themselves who, through\\nbetter knowledge, become the owners of their human\\nrights.\\nIt is in this context that I would like to point out\\nthe initiative taken by all women Ministers for Foreign\\nAffairs present at the opening of the fifty-fifth session\\nof the General Assembly. We jointly launched an\\nappeal to our fellow leaders in order to energize our\\ncommon fight against the global scourge of HIV/AIDS,\\na scourge which increasingly affects women and girls.\\nOur efforts to counter the HIV/AIDS pandemic must be\\nmultifaceted. They must encompass access to adequate\\nmedical care, drugs and social protection; they must\\nencompass information and services available to girls\\nand women to help them understand their sexual and\\nreproductive rights in order to protect themselves from\\n19\\n\\nunwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted\\ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS. This should be\\ncombined with the education of young men to respect\\nwomen's self-determination and to share responsibility\\nwith women in matters of health, sexuality and\\nreproduction.\\nThe United Nations Decade for Human Rights\\nEducation, spanning the period 1995-2005, was\\nunanimously adopted by this Assembly at its forty-\\nninth session. We have reached its mid-term and might\\ntherefore wish to give it new momentum. We clearly\\ncame to understand that human rights education and\\nlearning serve as strategies for development on the one\\nhand and as preventive tools for human security on the\\nother.\\nFollowing an initiative taken by Austria in the\\nframework of the “Human Security Network” of\\nForeign Ministers, an International Workshop on\\nHuman Security and Human Rights Education was\\nconvened in Graz, Austria, early this year. Experts\\nfrom all continents called for human rights education\\nand learning as a common endeavour of governmental,\\nintergovernmental and non-governmental institutions.\\nThey concluded that human rights education should go\\nbeyond formal education so as to encompass all forms\\nof learning and different modes of socialization.\\nInnovative human rights education must be\\nparticipatory and operational, creative and\\nempowering. It must address all levels of society. All\\ncitizens, in particular all persons in positions of\\nleadership, must regard human rights standards as a\\nyardstick when making decisions.\\nIn this context, I applaud the initiatives taken in\\nAfrica, South Asia, Latin America and Europe to have\\nmunicipalities proclaim themselves “Human Rights\\nCities”. I am pleased to announce from this rostrum\\nthat the city of Graz will be the first “Human Rights\\nCity” in Europe.\\nWhile we affirm the universality of our human\\nrights, human rights education and learning will have\\nto be rooted in the rich cultural plurality of the world.\\nIn the diversity of learning processes we will better\\ncomprehend the common humanity we all share.\\nWhy, it will be asked, do I raise the issue of\\nhuman rights education and learning at the General\\nAssembly of the United Nations? It is because I am\\nconvinced that in this strategic triangle with human\\nsecurity and human development, human rights are of\\nprofoundly political significance for the direction we\\ntake in our development.\\nAs the acquisition of any political culture takes\\ntime, our efforts must be long-term and comprehensive.\\nAt the same time, there is a sense of urgency. This is\\nwhy I appeal to the Assembly to give our efforts in this\\narea a new momentum and new energy and direction.\\nLately civil society has pleaded for more political\\nleadership in this field. We should be ready to respond\\nand to develop new structures of partnership with civil\\nsociety and with the institutions already active in the\\nfield at national, regional and international levels.\\nThe global house of human rights must be built\\nevery day. It must be built by everyone and it must be\\nowned by everyone. Only then will it be a house of\\nprosperity, a house of freedom and a house of peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Ms. Lydie Polfer, Vice-Prime Minister and Minister for\\nForeign Affairs of Luxembourg regrets having had to\\ncut short her stay in New York. She has asked me to\\nmake this statement in her place.\\nThe Millennium Summit has given us the\\ntestimony of the heads of State and Government. This\\nexceptional meeting was the opportunity for a renewed\\ncommitment of States throughout the world to our\\nOrganization, encouraging common efforts to give\\nevery citizen the freedom to enjoy a decent life and\\nopening the way for self-fulfilment for individuals and\\ntheir communities.\\nWe congratulate and commend you, Sir, as the\\nnew President of the General Assembly.

This year is a time to speak further of\\nthe principle of shared responsibility, because the\\nworld has to face the old challenges of violence and\\ndevelopment, as well as the more recent one of\\nglobalization.\\nGlobalization is both a source of achievement and\\ncause for concern. It is ambivalent and requires\\nadequate instruments in order to manage it and gear it\\ntowards equitable development. Without a common\\ndefinition of the rules to be applied, it could give rise\\nto bitterness and revolt. But the use of violence might\\ncompromise the path towards development. It is a\\nmatter of concern that worldwide arms sales have been\\non the rise since 1996. The horror of constant violence\\ncommitted by human beings against each other could\\nsimply make us grieve. However, such a passive\\nattitude would not do justice to the realities of this\\nworld. The number of armed conflicts has in fact gone\\ndown, from 55 in 1992 to 36 in 1998, but this bare\\nstatistic does not explain how this decrease took place.\\n2\\n\\nHowever, another statistic should grab our attention:\\nbetween 1974 and 1999, 113 countries went from an\\nauthoritarian regime to a multi-party system. More\\nmeaningful than statistics is the encouraging fact that\\nthe number of negotiation processes has increased, the\\nkey to their success often being innovative formulas to\\nachieve peaceful coexistence where previously there\\nwas deadlock and resentment.\\nEast Timor, the conference between Somalis in\\nDjibouti and the new inter-Korean dialogue are recent\\nexamples. In spite of the obvious difficulties, these\\nconstructive developments show by their number and\\ndiversity that preventing conflicts is a strategy in\\nmotion. We have to consolidate this strategy of\\nprevention in order to show that it produces lasting\\nresults. Of course, there are many failures, and we must\\nnot close our eyes to the difficulties.\\nIn Kosovo, in particular, intolerant behaviour led\\nto a sort of blindness, even in people who had\\nthemselves suffered oppression. Psychology teaches us\\nthat former victims do not always avoid eventually\\nbecoming executioners. We must put an end to this\\nvicious circle and stop unbridled criminality. The\\ncommitment of the Special Representative, Bernard\\nKouchner, and of all those who are working to brighten\\na grey sky brings us a message of hope which will bear\\nfruit.\\nAt the end of the cold war our hopes were\\nperhaps inspired by impatience. Today we see that\\nthere are solid foundations: above and beyond\\nacademic investigations and the awakening of\\nconscience, concrete action is being taken. We thank\\nthe community of organizations and individuals present\\nin the field; those who pay with their lives expect\\nothers to support them and to provide the necessary\\nmeans.\\nBut the major responsibility is not to disappoint\\nthose in direct need of assistance: victims, displaced\\npersons and refugees, those denied the protection of the\\nrule of law, even the means of subsistence. And when\\nmanagement deficiencies lead to short-sighted over-\\nexploitation and stifling pollution of an environment\\nthat can take no more, this phenomenon should be\\nreversed and responsibility established and assumed.\\nHow can we believe that catastrophes will go\\nunnoticed or that international solidarity will not bother\\nto analyse the cause of events?\\nCrime must not pay. This concept will go from\\ntheory to practice in the globalization era. Information\\nis spreading ineluctably and innovations are being\\nmade. International law may be lagging behind certain\\ntechnologies, but it is in the process of being\\ndeveloped. For example, universal participation in the\\noverall structure of multilateral treaties, which was\\nstrongly stimulated by the Millennium Summit.\\nAnother example is the courts to try war crimes,\\ngenocide or crimes against humanity. After the creation\\nof tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,\\nsome countries are considering establishing courts in\\ncooperation with the United Nations. National courts\\nhave instituted proceedings, and as a result the era of\\nimpunity is ending. Luxembourg was the eighteenth\\nState to ratify the Rome Statute of the International\\nCriminal Court, which will go into effect after 41 more\\nratifications.\\nIn democracy the rule of law prevails, but\\npolitical action is crucial to its development. Through\\nthe major conferences of the 1990s and their follow-\\nups, the United Nations has shown clearly that such\\nconferences are also an important source of law. The\\nguidelines that emerge stimulate the creation of\\ndomestic laws, and their juxtaposition produces a vast,\\ninternationally recognized network. Future actions,\\nincluding the campaign against small arms, financing\\nfor development and the World Conference against\\nRacism, will help promote the rule of law. Stable, but\\nnot rigidly fixed, transparent and subject to democratic\\ncontrols, the rule of law is certainly one of the most\\nreliable pillars for development.\\nBut the international community and the United\\nNations will have to build other pillars as well as part\\nof the structure for a world in which poverty and\\nviolence no longer threaten us. Without going into\\ndetail, I refer to the need to remember, respect for\\nequality, the will for prevention and openness to\\ncooperation.\\nThe century which is drawing to a close was the\\nmost terrible in the history of mankind in terms of\\nabsolute numbers of victims, and also in conceptual\\nterms, because it led to the development and use of\\nweapons of mass destruction. Above all, it saw several\\ncases of genocide on an unheard-of scale, openly\\nmotivated by the most despicable racism. It is essential\\nto study the mechanisms which lead to these\\naberrations into inhumanity, because repetitions of such\\n3\\n\\ndestructive phenomena should be rejected and made\\nimpossible.\\nThe conclusion to be drawn is that we should\\nremember, which means escaping from ignorance and\\nalways bearing in mind the lessons of the past. If the\\ncountries of the European Union are very sensitive\\nwhenever they encounter xenophobia, racism and the\\nrejection of those who are different, it is because we\\nare resolved at all costs to act to avoid once again\\nsuccumbing to the sickness of hatred. A Europe with a\\ngrowing population, a European Union spreading to the\\neast and the south, must act with determination to\\ncontinue the course of openness.\\nLuxembourg is a laboratory with a mixture of\\npeoples, as a result of our being at the crossroads of\\nFrench and German culture and because of the impact\\nof immigration of long ago. The moral outlook of its\\ncitizens leads them to respect others and their\\nindividuality. With the coming of sovereignty,\\nindependence and development became a reality for\\nour country, and with them a strong adherence to the\\nprinciple of equality, whether of individuals or States.\\nIt is the responsibility of all States to expose the\\ndangers of any tendency to feel contempt for others.\\nUnfortunately, division and lack of respect for the\\nworth of the individual can be seen on every continent.\\nOnly five years ago the world deplored the most\\nviolent racist crimes in Bosnia and Rwanda. Such\\ncrimes must be rejected, for they create openings that\\nthe prejudiced quickly take advantage of. We must\\ncollectively assume responsibility in the fight against\\nthis vicious circle.\\nRespect for equality requires that we do not make\\nindependence a sanctuary. Rather, it demands that we\\naccept each other as partners and recognize the\\nlegitimacy of our respective interests. Thanks to the\\nprogress of the European Union, classic sovereignty\\nhas been replaced for its member States by an\\ninterdependence whose positive effects are impressive.\\nThe solution, in the year 2000, is no longer abstract\\nindependence, but concrete cooperation.\\nThroughout the year 2000, the Security Council\\nhas devoted a great deal of time to Africa in\\nrecognition of the seriousness of the phenomenon of\\ntaking large portions of countries hostage. Some of\\nthese crises are being fuelled by the exploitation of\\nnatural resources. The significant international reaction\\nto these events is encouraging, but it must also lead to\\nthe elimination of these situations. Among them, I will\\nmention the problems in Angola, Sierra Leone and the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\\nThese catastrophes, along with other\\ndevelopments  in particular in East Timor, in\\nsouthern Lebanon and along the border between\\nEthiopia and Eritrea  have contributed to a\\nconsiderable increase in United Nations peacekeeping\\nactivities. However, these activities are suffering from\\na lack of resources, to such an extent that both their\\noperations and their credibility are compromised.\\nInstead of being a deterrent, they risk becoming simply\\nan alibi.\\nI hope that this session will be able to adopt\\nenergetic measures to implement the recommendations\\nof the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations,\\nchaired by Mr. Brahimi. The lack of financial resources\\nshould not be an insurmountable obstacle. Further, it is\\nappropriate to take up this issue as part of this session's\\nagenda item on the scale of assessments for\\npeacekeeping operations. But in fact, these activities\\nare above all operations aimed at maintaining\\nceasefires. Achieving peace requires other efforts \\nfirst and foremost the will to prevent conflicts and the\\ndetermination to avoid their resurgence.\\nAfter the research, the passionate discussions and\\nthe debates  most recently those that took place in\\nthe Security Council and in the General Assembly\\ncommittee on the prevention of conflicts in Africa \\nhave we found sufficient will to now take action? Such\\na critical mass is necessary if a determined will to\\nprevent conflicts is going to be manifested.\\nHuman solidarity will be essential in those\\ninstances in which the parties show they are incapable\\nof avoiding conflict and when attacks on the integrity\\nof individuals and major material consequences can be\\nclearly foreseen. Indifference and lack of assistance in\\nthe face of danger no longer accord with the universal\\nawareness of the reality of our interconnectedness,\\nwhich grows in parallel with the spread of knowledge.\\nThis is an ethical issue, but it is also an issue of\\nknowledge and technical resources. Luxembourg\\nintends to create a civilian action corps to go on\\nhumanitarian and human development missions.\\nLuxembourg will contribute to the United Nations\\nfunds for peace-building, and it is involved in\\npeacekeeping operations and in reconstruction\\nmissions.\\n4\\n\\nThe will to prevent conflicts entails the ability to\\nchoose from among a great range of mechanisms that\\nare capable of dissuading those who, as a result of\\nignorance or provocation, are turning to aggression.\\nThis will to prevent conflicts can be that much more\\neffective in managing disputes if it is invoked well\\nbefore violence breaks out. Over eight years, the\\ndiscreet action of the High Commissioner on National\\nMinorities of the Organization for Security and\\nCooperation in Europe, Mr. Max van der Stoel, has\\namply justified the confidence placed in him by 55\\nEuropean States and former Soviet Republics and has\\nproduced significant results.\\nWhen people are struggling in isolation, external\\ncooperation and solidarity can remove the most\\ndifficult obstacles. The noteworthy Human\\nDevelopment Report 2000 of the United Nations\\nDevelopment Programme stresses the importance of\\npreventing conflicts, of inclusive democracy and of\\nrespect for human rights as means of preventing\\ncountries that have been bled white from being\\nexcluded from the benefits of the global economy and\\nof global technology.\\nFor their part, Mr. Annan and Mr. Brahimi remind\\nus that every action to reduce poverty and ensure a\\nsolid foundation for growth is a step towards\\npreventing conflicts. This is one of the keys of\\ndevelopment. It is a very reliable method for building\\nconfidence and reducing poverty. It is a responsibility\\nthat we must take up.\\nThe effort cannot be undertaken unless external\\ncooperation is not in itself an obstacle. In many cases it\\ngives rise to questions and resistance. But cooperation\\nthat is not welcome is pointless. Unfortunately, at times\\nmistrust and a certain pride prevail and lead to a\\nfortress mentality. This in turn can lead to\\noveremphasizing identity issues and to the\\ndevelopment of a mental block.\\nWhen a terrifying earthquake rocked Turkey in\\n1999, the Greeks offered their assistance. This gesture\\nand the Turks' acceptance of it have profoundly\\ntransformed bilateral relations that have been\\nparticularly difficult. This positive, spontaneous\\ndevelopment was the result of the awareness of Foreign\\nMinisters Papandreou and Cem that the ongoing harm\\nbeing caused by the earlier mistrust was not acceptable.\\nThis positive development is continuing, and it is\\ngreatly hoped that it will soon be reflected in the\\nconversations, under the aegis of the United Nations,\\nbetween the Greek and Turkish Cypriot\\ncommunities  conversations that are at present\\nindirect.\\nWhen confidence comes up against the invisible\\nwall of ignorance, even the tendered hand will not be\\ntaken. Thus, those who are separated by a\\npsychological chasm should construct a bridgehead and\\nexpress in a decent manner their willingness to achieve\\nmutual recognition.\\nThe Israelis and Palestinians were reconciled in\\nsignificant ways as a result of the Camp David\\nconversations. President Clinton, for his perseverance,\\nPrime Minister Barak and President Arafat, for their\\nawareness of history and their common acceptance of\\ntheir shared responsibility to the future, deserve\\nencouragement and the firmest support in their effort to\\nconclude this historic process. I am convinced that the\\nresources of this dialogue have not been exhausted.\\nThere is an opportunity to achieve, within the next few\\nweeks, a framework agreement. It must remain clear\\nthat the willingness to cooperate has been firmly\\nestablished. This willingness will be seconded by the\\nwillingness of the international community, and of\\nEurope in particular, to offer its support to the\\nestablishment of peace and to the reconstruction\\nefforts.\\nThe sculpting of the role of the United Nations,\\nthe shape of its future work, will be a complex and\\ndemanding task if we expect the Organization to escape\\nits current fragility and affirm its responsibility. But\\nperhaps we can rely increasingly on the vast experience\\nthat has been gained during past actions. The\\ndevelopment of this collection of experiences requires\\nincreasing internal cohesion. The responsibility for the\\ndevelopment of this cohesion falls on the\\nOrganization's Members. This is the objective we must\\nset for ourselves. The willingness to cooperate must\\nlead to the elaboration of healthy administrative and\\nfinancial structures, as well as to balanced relations\\nbetween the principal organs, none of which should be\\nexempt from periodic reform.\\nToday the United Nations cannot be said to be in\\na position to meet these criteria. Therefore, is it not\\nindispensable that its Members pay their assessments\\nwithout delay or conditions, and in full?\\nThe fact that the Security Council is not being\\nreformed and the distance between the Council and the\\nvast majority of General Assembly members does not\\n5\\n\\ncontribute to the effectiveness of the Organization. The\\nbridges that the United Nations will try to construct\\nshould include, in order to seek greater unity of action,\\na reinvigorated relationship between the General\\nAssembly and a duly enlarged Security Council.\\nThe United Nations will be put to the test. As a\\nresult of the pursuit of globalization the Organization\\nwill be in demand. Will it be capable of meeting the\\nchallenge and of responding in a way that will put the\\nOrganization at the centre of the major international\\ndiscussions? Even after the Millennium Summit it\\nwould be rash to claim that this question is closed.\\nLuxembourg hopes that it will be possible to respond\\npositively, and Luxembourg reaffirms its willingness to\\ncooperate so that we can proceed together in this\\ndirection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"I have\\nthe honour of speaking this year on behalf of the\\nEuropean Union, which France is presiding over until\\nthe end of December.\\nIn this capacity, it is a great pleasure for me to\\ncongratulate the President on his election. It\\nsymbolizes the respect the international community has\\nboth for his country and for himself.\\nI would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr.\\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, for his skill in guiding the\\nproceedings of the fifty-fourth session of the General\\nAssembly, Mr. Sam Nujoma and Ms. Tarja Halonen for\\ntheir work with you, Mr. President, as Co-Chairpersons\\nof the Millennium Summit.\\n19\\n\\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General\\nof the Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan. His international\\naction, his independence and his vision have made a\\ndecisive contribution to asserting the key role the\\nUnited Nations plays and must continue to play. The\\nEuropean Union wishes to assure him of its support for\\nhis work and for the Organization and its\\nrepresentatives.\\nThe Millennium Summit, an unprecedented\\ngathering of 155 heads of State and Government,\\nallowed us to address the main challenges facing the\\nworld community and the role of the United Nations in\\nthe twenty-first century, which will begin on 1 January\\n2001.\\nThe Union notes with great satisfaction that the\\nSummit produced a political document setting forth a\\nroad-map for the Organization for the years to come.\\nThese guidelines are based on ideas outlined in the\\nSecretary-General's report. It is now up to the General\\nAssembly to implement them. The Union will\\ncontribute actively to this.\\nPeacekeeping, strengthening international\\nsecurity and defending human rights are the central\\nprinciples underpinning the European Union's foreign\\npolicy. Recent crises on Europe's very doorstep have\\nconvinced us that we cannot remain idle when these\\nfundamental principles are violated. In this regard, the\\nEuropean Union approves of the priority given to\\npeacekeeping during last week's meetings. Mr.\\nBrahimi's report offers an in-depth analysis on this\\nsubject. It presents useful recommendations for the\\nmandates of peacekeeping operations, operational\\nplanning in New York and deployment. It presents a\\nunique opportunity to strengthen the United Nations\\ncapacity for peace operations. The European Union\\nwill actively participate in considering these\\nrecommendations.\\nThe Union has decided to equip itself to be a\\nmajor political actor and to play its full role on the\\ninternational stage. To this end, and within a very short\\ntime-frame, it has undertaken decisive measures. New\\ndecision-making, action-oriented political and military\\nbodies have been set up: a political and security\\ncommittee, a military committee, a European Union\\nmilitary staff, a situation centre and a committee for\\ncivilian crisis management. These bodies will enable\\nthe European Union to intervene quickly and credibly\\nin the management of international crises.\\nThe European Union has also announced its\\nintention to establish by 2003 a force of 60,000 troops\\nfor international missions involving the whole range of\\nconflict-prevention and crisis-management operations,\\nwith the requisite air and naval support for deployment\\nwithin 60 days for a period of at least one year. This\\nautumn there will be a conference for the commitment\\nof capability at which each Member State shall pledge\\nits contribution to this joint endeavour.\\nThe Union has also set ambitious and realistic\\ntargets for developing collective capabilities. In\\naddition to its military resources, it will develop\\ncivilian intervention capabilities, including a corps of\\ncivilian police, whose contribution to peacekeeping is\\ninvaluable. In this connection, Member States have set\\nthemselves the goal of being able, by 2003, to provide\\nup to 5,000 police officers, 1,000 of whom will be\\ndeployment-ready within 30 days.\\nThese decisions now enable the European Union\\nto complement its already sizeable economic and\\nhumanitarian programmes with the full range of\\nresources required for crisis management. Of course,\\nthese activities are designed in full respect for the\\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. Now more\\nthan ever, it is vital to establish working ties with the\\nUnited Nations. To initiate this cooperation, the\\nEuropean Union troika will discuss this issue for the\\nfirst time with the Secretary-General. On behalf of the\\nEuropean Union, I hereby invite Mr. Kofi Annan to go\\nto Brussels for a working meeting with the organs of\\nthe Union.\\nThe European Union hails the considerable\\nefforts and determination shown by the President of the\\nPalestinian Authority and the Israeli Prime Minister\\nduring recent negotiations to reach a final agreement\\nbetween the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. We\\nwelcome in particular the renewed vigour with which\\nvery sensitive issues have been addressed at this time.\\nWe commend President Clinton and the Secretary\\nof State for their unflagging efforts to facilitate\\nnegotiations. Circumstances favourable to reconciling\\npositions continue to exist. We urge the parties to seize\\nthis historic opportunity, show courage in decisive\\nchoices, take fully into account human realities and the\\nrecognized rights of all, and thereby achieve a final\\nagreement.\\nThe European Union welcomes Israel's\\nwithdrawal from the zone it occupied in southern\\n20\\n\\nLebanon. It welcomes the redeployment of the United\\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon and the presence of a\\njoint security force, sent to the area by the Lebanese\\nGovernment. It urges all parties to fulfil their\\nresponsibilities in order to defuse tensions. The\\nEuropean Union believes that only a comprehensive\\nsettlement encompassing every track of the peace\\nprocess, including the Israeli-Syrian track, is likely to\\nguarantee lasting stability in the region. It will continue\\nto support the efforts of the parties to this end and\\ncontribute to the implementation of any agreements\\nthat may be reached.\\nTurning to Europe, the situation in the western\\nBalkans is a matter of serious concern to the entire\\ninternational community. Ten years of conflict have\\nravaged the region, leading to severe human suffering\\nand to politically unstable and therefore dangerous\\nsituations. But beyond accumulated hardships and the\\nlagging economic and social development of many of\\nthose countries, all of the peoples and nearly all of the\\nleaders of the region have realized that it does have a\\nfuture, and that future is Europe. Today, all Europeans\\nnow share the belief that these countries are bound one\\nday to join the European Union.\\nThis is why the European Council has reiterated\\nthat its goal is to firmly attach the countries of the\\nregion to Europe. This means the greatest possible\\nintegration into the political, economic and social\\ncurrents of Europe through the stabilization and\\nassociation process, political dialogue, trade\\nliberalization, the harmonization of their laws with\\nthose of the European Union, and cooperation in justice\\nand domestic affairs.\\nThe assistance provided by the European Union\\nto countries of the region over the last 10 years —\\nnearly 8 billion euros — is considerable. The European\\nUnion will continue to sustain this stabilization and\\nassociation process by providing the western Balkan\\ncountries with massive technical, economic and\\nfinancial assistance and by granting them asymmetrical\\ntrade advantages in farming and industry very soon,\\nwhich will pave the way for the creation of a free trade\\nzone with the European Union. In the context of\\nelections concerning almost the entire region, we will\\nencourage them to develop regional cooperation and to\\ncontinue to make determined efforts for political,\\neconomic and social reform in order to consolidate\\ndemocracy and human rights, to build the rule of law\\nand lay the groundwork for sustainable development.\\nIn this context, the European Union has reaffirmed its\\ndetermination to continue to be the driving force in the\\nStability Pact for South-eastern Europe, which\\nrepresents a new vision of cooperation between the\\ncountries of the region and the international\\ncommunity.\\nThe summit to be held shortly in Croatia of the\\nEuropean Union and the Western Balkan countries —\\non the basis of a French proposal — will signal our\\ncommon resolve to overcome the divisions of the past.\\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will not be\\nable to participate in the conference, as the nature of its\\npresent regime does not allow it to do so. But the Serbs\\nknow that they have their place in the European family\\nand that the European Union is looking forward to the\\nday when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is in a\\nposition to participate fully in the stabilization and\\nassociation process and to recover its rightful place in\\nEurope. The elections to be held on 24 September\\ncould be decisive in this respect.\\nIn Kosovo the international community, acting on\\nthe basis of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999),\\nhas achieved praiseworthy results. Thanks must be\\ngiven to all those who have made this possible in spite\\nof enormous difficulties, especially the Special\\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, the United\\nNations staff and the Kosovo Force soldiers, the many\\ninternational organizations there on the ground and the\\nnon-governmental organizations. The first democratic\\nmunicipal elections in Kosovo, to be held in a few\\nweeks' time, will constitute a major step in the\\nimplementation of resolution 1244 (1999). I would\\nforcefully reiterate that the international community\\nwill not allow unacceptable acts of violence, whatever\\ntheir motivation, to cause the democratic electoral\\nprocess under way to fail. We will not let extremists\\nfrom whatever faction sabotage the work accomplished\\nover the past year under the auspices of the United\\nNations.\\nThe European Union considers the status quo in\\nCyprus unacceptable, and it supports the efforts of the\\nSecretary-General to reach a negotiated,\\ncomprehensive, fair and lasting settlement consistent\\nwith relevant Security Council resolutions. It reiterates\\nits commitment to stability and prosperity throughout\\nthe Mediterranean region. With talks beginning right\\nhere under the auspices of the Secretary-General, it\\n21\\n\\ninvites the parties concerned to enter into substantive\\ntalks.\\nThe European Union is equally determined in its\\nsupport for efforts to prevent and settle conflicts in\\nAfrica, in close cooperation with the United Nations,\\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and other\\nsubregional organizations and in accordance with the\\nobjectives agreed at the Africa-Europe Summit, held\\nlast April in Cairo under the Portuguese presidency of\\nthe European Union. It will lend its backing to the\\nmeasures taken jointly by the OAU and the United\\nNations to implement the peace settlement between\\nEthiopia and Eritrea. In supporting the deployment of\\ninternational observers, the European Union is also\\nwilling to lend its support to the establishment and\\ndemarcation of borders, to demining and to assistance\\nto refugees and displaced persons. It is endeavouring to\\nprovide assistance to the war-stricken populations of\\nboth countries, whose immense suffering has been\\ncompounded by drought.\\nThe European Union is deeply concerned by the\\ndevelopments in the Democratic Republic of the\\nCongo. It calls on all parties to the Lusaka Agreement\\nto implement their commitments, including those made\\nat Kampala. This will allow for progress with respect\\nto the military and political provisions, all of which are\\nunder threat due to the continued fighting and the\\ndeadlock in preparing for a national dialogue. It also\\nurges them to abide by the relevant Security Council\\nresolutions, in particular resolution 1304 (2000), which\\ncalls for an orderly withdrawal of foreign forces from\\nCongolese territory and for the cooperation of all\\nparties in the deployment of the United Nations\\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\\nthe Congo (MONUC) through the lifting of restrictions\\non the freedom of movement of MONUC personnel\\nand by ensuring their security.\\nThe illegal exploitation of the natural resources of\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, a violation of\\nthe country's sovereignty, is also unacceptable. The\\nEuropean Union therefore commends the establishment\\nby the Secretary-General on 15 August last of a group\\nof experts in charge of analysing ties between the\\nillegal exploitation of those riches and the continuation\\nof the conflict.\\nWe are pleased to note greater awareness about\\nthe illicit trade in diamonds and other minerals, which\\ndirectly fuels conflicts. This is the case in particular\\nwith the illicit trade in diamonds in Angola, whereby\\nUNITA has been funding its war effort. We underscore\\nthe importance of complying with Security Council\\nresolutions on this matter. We welcome the decision to\\nplace this important question on the General\\nAssembly's agenda. The discussion should be based on\\nthe Kimberley process. It should reflect the work of the\\npreparatory conference co-chaired by the United\\nKingdom and Russia. Lastly, it should examine the\\nproposal made at Miyazaki to establish a standing\\ngroup of independent experts to formulate ways of\\npreventing illicit trade.\\nThe European Union reiterates its support for\\nresolution 1306 (2000) on Sierra Leone, which\\ntightened existing arms sanctions and established an\\nembargo on raw diamonds illegally exported from\\nSierra Leone. The European Union calls on all the\\nparties to the conflict to comply with the principles and\\nobjectives of the Lomé Agreement and to be fully\\ninvolved in the re-establishment of peace and stability\\nand compliance with human rights in Sierra Leone.\\nThe European Union and its member States will\\ncontinue to contribute to African capacity and means of\\naction in conflict prevention and resolution, in\\nparticular through support for the OAU and\\nsubregional organizations and initiatives.\\nThe European Union is deeply concerned at the\\nsituation in Myanmar. It asks the Myanmar authorities\\nto immediately restore Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's\\nfreedom of speech, movement and communication with\\nthe outside. It is urgent for dialogue to begin between\\nthe Myanmar authorities and the democratic\\nopposition, including the National League for\\nDemocracy and national minorities. The Union\\nsupports the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for\\nBurma, Mr. Razali, in his efforts to find a solution.\\nThe European Union expresses its solidarity with\\nthe people of East Timor and commends the work done\\nby the United Nations Transitional Administration in\\nEast Timor (UNTAET) in close cooperation with the\\npolitical authorities of East Timor. It is in favour of\\naccelerating reconstruction assistance in order to\\nguarantee a successful transition and avoid any delay in\\nthe timetable leading to independence.\\nWe are extremely concerned by the instability\\ncaused by the militias in both East and West Timor.\\nThe new outbreaks of violence by them have taken the\\nlives of two “blue beret” peacekeepers and, more\\n22\\n\\nrecently, of three personnel of the Office of the United\\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\\nThe European Union calls on the Indonesian authorities\\nto adopt effective measures to control the militias\\nwithout delay.\\nThe European Union also calls for the termination\\nof terrorist activity in Kashmir, the implementation of\\nconfidence- and security-building measures and strict\\nrespect for the line of control in order to restore a\\npeaceful local climate and enable the dialogue between\\nPakistan and India to resume in the spirit of the Lahore\\nDeclaration. The European Union will be looking\\nclosely for such signs from the parties involved and\\nwill encourage initiatives likely to resolve all the\\ndisputes between the two countries.\\nIt is important for the specific measures laid\\ndown in Security Council resolution 1172 (1998) to be\\nimplemented and for Pakistan and India to subscribe to\\nthe international non-proliferation regime and sign the\\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\\nHaving advocated direct dialogue between the\\ntwo Koreas for many years, the European Union\\nwelcomes the historic inter-Korean Summit that took\\nplace in Pyongyang from 13-15 June this year. This is\\nan important step on the road to reconciliation between\\nthe Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's\\nRepublic of Korea, opening bright prospects for\\nstrengthening the stability of the region. We invite the\\ntwo countries, who have been members of the United\\nNations since 1991, to continue this process in order to\\nhelp the Korean people heal the wounds of the past.\\nOn the subject of Haiti, the European Union\\nrecalls that full respect for the constitutional provisions\\nconcerning the elections and electoral legislation\\ncurrently in force is the basis of democracy and the rule\\nof law.\\nThe threat of proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction and their delivery systems is a crucial issue\\nthat the European Union — which shares the concern\\nfor international peace and security that ought to\\ninspire the nations represented here — is resolved to\\ncombat relentlessly. To this end, international\\ncooperation must be stressed, along with the\\ndevelopment of multilateral standards for non-\\nproliferation, arms control and disarmament.\\nThis is particularly true of chemical and\\nbiological weapons, which have now been banned. The\\nUnion is working towards the early conclusion of a\\nprotocol containing reliable and effective verification\\nmeasures to strengthen the 1972 Convention on the\\nProhibition of the Development, Production and\\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin\\nWeapons and on their Destruction. We are equally\\ndetermined to ensure nuclear non-proliferation and\\ndisarmament, where so much progress has been made\\nsince the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to which 187 States are\\nnow parties.\\nSince the end of the cold war, effective\\ninstruments for ending the arms race and achieving\\ndisarmament have begun to see the light of day, with\\nthe halt to testing, the treaty enshrining it, the first two\\nSTART agreements to reduce the largest nuclear\\narsenals and a host of unilateral decisions following the\\nsame trend. Our priority must be to consolidate this\\nmechanism. A start was made with the Review\\nConferences of 1995 and 2000; the results, which we\\nwelcome, must be fully implemented.\\nWe must give full weight to strengthening the\\nsafeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency\\n(IAEA) through the widespread implementation of the\\nmeasures contained in the 1997 Model Protocol and to\\nremain alert to the issue of NPT compliance. We must\\nalso revive the momentum of the multilateral\\nnegotiations.\\nThe entry into force of the Comprehensive Test\\nBan Treaty, the completion of the operational readiness\\nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization\\n(CTBTO) and the negotiation at the Disarmament\\nConference of a fissile material cut-off treaty are all\\nnecessary steps that are of concern and ought to\\nmobilize all States, be they parties to the NPT or not.\\nThe start of this negotiation implies urgent negotiations\\non a working programme in the Conference on\\nDisarmament. International standards in this field can\\nonly be effective if they are universal. Arsenal\\nreductions, which are the prime responsibility of the\\nnuclear-weapon States, must also be continued. This\\nwill enable us to move closer to our common\\nobjectives — namely, the elimination of nuclear\\nweapons and general, comprehensive disarmament\\nunder strict and effective international control.\\nThe issue of small arms and light weapons is just\\nas sensitive in many regions of the world. It deserves\\nspecial attention. The 15 European Union members\\n23\\n\\nwill contribute to the preparation of the United Nations\\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, which will take place\\nduring the summer of 2001, with the objective of\\nobtaining a positive and enforceable plan of action to\\ncombat the destabilizing accumulation and spread of\\nsmall arms and light weapons. At the same time, the\\nUnion shall continue its drive for the implementation\\nof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\\nMines and on their Destruction. It will join in the\\nefforts to achieve the total elimination of anti-\\npersonnel mines.\\nOn the very important subject of human rights,\\nthe European Union will continue to support the efforts\\nof the United Nations to reach the goal set by the\\nSecretary-General to put human rights at the heart of\\nevery aspect of its work. The best guarantee of solid\\nprogress in this area is each person's awareness of the\\nimportance of human rights and democracy and the\\nemergence of groups who actively promote them in\\nevery country. In this connection, the European Union\\nwelcomes the designation, thanks to the support of\\nmany countries, of the Special Representative of the\\nSecretary-General on Human Rights Defenders, Ms.\\nJilani; we welcome her appointment and assure her of\\nour full backing as she undertakes her duties.\\nThis year the United Nations has once again\\ndemonstrated that it is the main forum of progress in\\nsetting standards for human rights, as witnessed by the\\nadoption of two optional protocols to the Convention\\non the Rights of the Child on the sexual exploitation of\\nchildren and on children in armed conflicts. This\\nrepresents a major step forward in favour of the\\nprotection of children. The European Union intends to\\ncontribute actively to the special session of the United\\nNations General Assembly for the follow-up to the\\nWorld Children's Summit, to be held next year, which\\nwill give the international community yet another\\nopportunity to help this cause move forward.\\nAnother important task, the World Conference\\nAgainst Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia\\nand Related Intolerance, lies ahead. At the European\\nPreparatory Conference, to be held in October under\\nthe auspices of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg,\\nthe European Union will demonstrate its commitment\\nto combat all expressions of racism, whatever form\\nthey take. The Union, all of whose members have\\nabolished the death penalty, calls on States that have\\nnot yet done so to adopt a moratorium as a first step\\ntowards the eventual abolition of this punishment,\\nwhich is contrary to human dignity.\\nThe European Union will endeavour to strengthen\\ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism\\nand will play an active role in the negotiations to be\\nheld to that end. It earnestly hopes that this General\\nAssembly will adopt the Convention Against\\nTransnational Organized Crime and its Protocols at the\\nPalermo Conference next December. Given that such\\ncrime, that one of its most odious manifestations is the\\ntrafficking in human beings, and that it poses an ever-\\ngrowing threat to our societies, it is vital for the\\ninternational community to develop the means to\\ncooperate and fight against it effectively.\\nLastly, the European Union looks forward to the\\nearly establishment of the International Criminal Court.\\nI would like to recall that ratification by 42 States is\\nstill needed for this.\\nBy way of conclusion, I would like to stress one\\nlast point, and that is sustainable development. The\\nEuropean Union's contribution to international\\ncooperation is substantial. With 30 per cent of the\\nglobal gross domestic product, the Union contributes\\n36 per cent of the United Nations regular budget and\\n39 per cent of the peacekeeping budget. As you know,\\nit also contributes the rather large amount of around 55\\nper cent of the world total of official development\\nassistance. We are pleased with everything that was\\nsaid last week on this extremely important matter, and\\nwe will continue our exemplary work on sustainable\\ndevelopment. Indeed, we believe that development is\\none of the key ways of resolving all of the problems\\nfacing us throughout the world, as outlined in my\\nstatement, and the European Union wishes to express\\nits strong, continuing commitment to that end.\", \"Mr. President, I should first of all like to congratulate\\nyou on your election to the Presidency of the fifty-fifth\\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish you every\\nsuccess in this task which is both difficult and\\ninspiring.\\nAllow me to include in this tribute the Secretary-\\nGeneral who has a crucial role in promoting\\ninternational cooperation for peace, security, justice\\nand development in the world.\\nI fully associate myself with the speech made by\\nmy French colleague, Mr. Hubert Vedrine, on behalf of\\nthe European Union. His declaration covered quite\\nbroadly European concerns regarding different regions\\nof the world and the crises they continue to experience.\\nLike my European colleagues, I will confine myself to\\nrepeating the encouragements of the European Union\\nfor the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this historic\\nopportunity now within their reach to conclude a\\nframework agreement in the coming weeks.\\nThe new century is a blank page. It depends on us\\nand on our Organization to provide the appropriate\\nanswers to the challenges inherited from the past\\ncentury. The Heads of State and Government who\\ngathered here for the Millennium Summit set forth the\\nobjectives that will mobilize our energy for the coming\\nyears. I will only mention three of our highest\\npriorities. \\nFirst, world peace. This is the primary\\nresponsibility of the Security Council. It is therefore\\nessential to bring the ongoing reforms to a successful\\nconclusion and to improve the Council's legitimacy as\\nwell as its representative character. To adapt the\\nSecurity Council to the evolution of the world is the\\nprimary condition for its ability to respond to our\\nexpectations. Belgium coordinates a group of ten small\\nand medium-sized countries in the quest for\\nconstructive compromise formulas. Regarding the\\nenlargement of the Security Council, the creation of ten\\nnew seats, five permanent and five non-permanent,\\nwith an equitable geographical distribution, seems to us\\nto be a path worth exploring. As for the right of veto,\\nwe have put forward a number of concrete and\\nmoderate proposals seeking a voluntary and partial\\nlimitation to the right of veto. Such a reform, a\\nbalanced one along these lines and responding to the\\nwishes of most Member States can, and should make\\nsignificant progress in the months to come.\\nSecondly, the elimination of poverty and\\nattainment of sustainable development. The\\nglobalization of the economy must proceed hand in\\nhand with job creation and economic take-off in the\\npoorest regions as well as with universally recognized\\nsocial and environmental norms. There is no more\\ndenying that great inequalities, differences in\\ndevelopment, the lack of good governance and\\ndisregard for human rights are factors which create\\ninstability, both within States and among States in their\\ninternational relations.\\nThirdly, the defence and promotion of democracy\\nand human rights. For us this requires equal\\nparticipation of men and women in public life and\\ndecision-making, as well as the fight against all forms\\nof racism, intolerance, discrimination and xenophobia.\\n8\\n\\nSerious violations of human rights and universal values\\nmust therefore never be allowed to go unpunished.\\nThis also implies a permanent quest for the\\nconditions, modalities and terms that underlie common\\nhuman values. Democracy  and on this at least we\\nshould all agree  is much more than a statement of\\nfact regarding an established balance of power or an\\narithmetic majority. It is a political morality that\\nincludes loyal electoral behaviour. It is respect for, and\\nencouragement of the open expression of differing\\npoints of view. It is a frame of mind based on a lofty\\nand optimistic conception of the human being.\\nI say this because, even at home in our old\\nEuropean democracies which one would consider safe\\nand sheltered, we see reappearing the vile spectre of\\nrejection of differences, exclusion and xenophobic or\\nslanderous prejudice.\\nEuropean parties are again raising and exalting\\nwhat is most sordid and most barbarous in human\\nnature. Saying nothing or resigning oneself to this fact\\nis tantamount to trivializing the phenomenon and\\ntrivialization means corruption of the spirit.\\nI say this also because we must recognize that our\\npolitical systems, in theory well equipped to withstand\\nsuch assaults, unfortunately tend all too often to give in\\nto the temptation to minimalize them under the\\nspecious invocation of so-called higher demands of\\nrealpolitik.\\nIt is not my purpose here to allege some moral\\nsuperiority but simply to remind ourselves that history\\nalways exacts a price when one refuses to learn from\\nits lessons.\\nBelgium has participated over the past decade in\\nnumerous peacekeeping operations under the auspices\\nof the United Nations, among others in Somalia,\\nRwanda and in the Balkans.\\nReviewing these experiences, the Belgian Senate\\nissued a detailed report in December 1997 containing\\nrecommendations that prefigure, to some extent, the\\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report. I\\nwill point out a few aspects on which there is complete\\nconvergence between the two reports.\\nFirst, United Nations forces must be prepared to\\nconfront the worst case scenario. The Blue Helmets\\nmust be trained, equipped and commanded for such an\\neventuality.\\nSecondly, these forces must have at their disposal\\nall relevant information, as well as the capacity to\\nanalyse such information in terms of strategy and\\ntactics, so they must be able to rely on an effective\\nintelligence capability.\\nThirdly, troop-contributing countries must be\\nclosely involved in the preparation of the mandates and\\nin the management of operations. The Assembly will\\nnot be surprised to hear me plead for the\\nrecommendations formulated in the Brahimi report to\\nreceive wide support of all Member States. I hope that\\nall actors concerned  the Member States, the Security\\nCouncil and the Secretariat  prove their\\ndetermination and their will to extend reforms to all\\nlevels and bodies of the Organization. I pledge the full\\nsupport of the Belgian Government to Deputy\\nSecretary-General Louise FrÈchette, who is responsible\\nfor their implementation.\\nI would also like to point out that, in our opinion,\\nthe conclusions of the Brahimi report cannot be\\ndissociated from other discussions to be held during the\\nfifty-fifth session, specifically those on the revision of\\nthe scale of assessments for peacekeeping budgets. In\\nthis regard as well, Member States will have to keep an\\nopen mind in order to set up an equitable system of\\nfinancial burden sharing that is adapted to the current\\nshape of the world.\\nAnother sensitive question manifests itself clearly\\nin the light of recent experiences, namely the proper\\nrole of the United Nations in relation to regional\\norganizations, and indeed even in relation to the\\ninitiatives of neighbouring States in a conflict zone.\\nLessons to be learned from the Yugoslav crisis are not\\nthe same as those that can be drawn from recent crises,\\nparticularly those in Africa. The goal in this regard is\\nnot to deny the merits of the regional approach. On the\\ncontrary, Belgium supports the creation of regional\\nrapid reaction forces in the service of peacekeeping, as\\nwas underlined one week ago by our Prime Minister,\\nGuy Verhofstadt, before this very body.\\nIt has to do more with highlighting the fact that\\nthe merits of the regional approach clearly can never\\njustify inaction on behalf of the international\\ncommunity or some sort of oratory diplomacy that\\npasses off solving problems to regional bodies and\\norganizations or to temporary coalitions. The Security\\nCouncil, as the supreme authority in matters of peace\\nand security, must be able to play its role, although it\\n9\\n\\nshould certainly be possible to refer some tasks to\\nregional institutions most able to take action.\\nI would like to make one last observation\\nregarding preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping. The\\narsenal at the disposal of the United Nations is not\\nlimited to sending troops. Other means are available\\nand, moreover, have been used repeatedly during recent\\nyears. I am referring to sanctions, and in particular to\\neconomic sanctions. This type of coercive measure, if\\napplied by the Security Council in accordance to the\\nCharter, can indeed produce the results envisaged when\\ntheir use is well targeted and limited in time or when\\nthey are inscribed in a realistic timeframe. But\\nexperience also shows that when they are applied\\nindiscriminately or when they serve overtly ambitious\\npolitical objectives, their effectiveness tends to\\ndecrease after a certain amount of time, and they may\\neven produce results wholly opposite to the ones\\ninitially envisaged. It is increasingly rare for sanctions\\nto be an useful instrument. Too often, they only\\npenalize populations without reaching the targeted\\nrulers, who often understand how to exploit the\\nboomerang effect of such sanctions.\\nI would like to move now to a subject dear to my\\nheart, Central Africa. During the past year, my country\\nhas expressed strongly its desire to be involved in, and\\nto contribute to, the mobilization of the international\\ncommunity in support of the Lusaka peace process. It\\nis essential that all Congolese parties engage resolutely\\nand without preconditions in a dialogue, as they agreed\\nto do in Lusaka. It is equally essential that our\\nOrganization and its Members who have the means to\\ndo so support the rapid deployment of the United\\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC), even though some\\nof the conditions and modalities of that operation may\\nhave to be reviewed in the light of the Brahimi report.\\nOne thing is certain: without the presence of a\\npeacekeeping force there will be no peace. Nor will\\nthere be peace, or even a permanent cessation of\\nhostilities, without a dialogue between the Congolese\\nparties. Both these questions are obviously linked. In\\norder to overcome the current impasse it is essential to\\nmake progress where possible. It therefore seems to us\\nthat the problem should not be stated in terms of\\npreconditions, order of events or priorities. In any\\nevent, the responsibility of the Security Council and\\nthe international community remain in place. Without a\\npolitical leap by the parties to the conflict, and without\\nthe necessary material support of the international\\ncommunity, the peace process is doomed to fail.\\nIn Burundi, where action by the countries of the\\nregion and the remarkable facilitation undertaken by\\nformer Presidents Nyerere and Mandela have started to\\nyield promising yet still incomplete results, it is also\\ntime for our Organization and the principal donor\\ncountries to act to consolidate the gains achieved and\\nto set the country once and for all on the path to peace\\nand development. It is in this spirit that Belgium will\\nparticipate actively in the meeting organized by the\\nEuropean Commission that is to be held in Brussels on\\n15 September to prepare for the donors' conference\\nsoon to be convened by France on the request of\\nNelson Mandela.\\nRegardless of how well-intentioned they may be,\\nefforts in the cause of peace can sometimes be to little\\navail, given the greed and rivalries fuelled by the\\nillegal exploitation of local resources. Resources\\nattained in that way are financing wars, which\\nthemselves become a source of profit. The problem of\\nthe diamond trade in conflict areas is at the centre of\\nthis question. We know that war diamonds represent\\nonly a fraction of international trade, but these illegal\\nrevenues nevertheless contribute to destabilizing the\\nsituation, encourage the logic of war and spread\\ncorruption and anarchy. Belgium is active in the efforts\\nto create a global system of verification. It is high time\\nindeed to put in place a realistic and effective legal\\nframework binding on everyone in order to regulate the\\ntrade in diamonds.\\nI would now like to speak about non-proliferation\\nand disarmament. Last April, during the Review\\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Belgium intervened\\nvigorously to express its concerns regarding a certain\\nnumber of elements that could lead to the weakening or\\nputting into question the very foundation of the non-\\nproliferation regime negotiated in recent decades. We\\ncertainly welcome the conclusions of the Conference\\nand the reflection that it triggered. That has led to a\\nfavourable climate for the implementation of the plan\\nof action. That being said, numerous States still refuse\\nto adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, while others\\nhave not yet ratified the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\\nWe have followed closely, and with some\\nconcern, the debate in the United States on anti-\\nballistic defence. Belgium is not opposed in principle\\n10\\n\\nto the idea of anti-missile defence. We are only stating\\nthat the political perception, the analysis of the threat\\nand the means to counter it vary greatly from region to\\nregion. There is no unique or universal response, but\\nwhat is essential is to make sure that an anti-missile\\nsystem, whatever it may be, should contribute to\\ngeneral stability and to the consolidation of mutual\\nconfidence. In other words, the decisions will have to\\nbe taken not only on the basis of a strategic and\\ntechnical analysis, but also on a consensual basis that\\nbuilds upon the overall political and strategic balance.\\nWe welcome the decision by the American\\nAdministration to postpone its decision on the\\nlaunching of a programme. Besides the question of the\\nfeasibility of such a programme, its unilateral nature\\nwould have a negative impact on our common\\ndisarmament objectives. We now hope that this\\ndecision will encourage negotiations for a START III\\nagreement between the United States and Russia. Rapid\\nprogress on a new, substantial reduction of strategic\\nnuclear arms could in turn lead to breaking the impasse\\nin negotiations for a fissile materials cut-off treaty at\\nthe Disarmament Commission in Geneva.\\nBelgium also welcomes heartily the adherence to\\ndate by 138 States to the Convention on the prohibition\\nof anti-personnel mines. Further efforts have to be\\nmade in order to implement it and mobilize the\\nnecessary funding to eliminate these especially\\ninhumane weapons forever.\\nI have dwelled mainly on peace and international\\nsecurity. I would like to turn to the two other subjects\\nthat Belgium considers a priority in the programme of\\naction of the Millennium Summit. Without these\\npriorities, our efforts in the field of security would be\\nfruitless. I am referring to universal respect for human\\nrights and worldwide development.\\nThe protection of human rights is a leading\\nfeature of my country's foreign policy. Our\\nparticipation in the Commission on Human Rights will\\nenable us to further enlarge our initiatives and our\\npolitical action. We will be able to act more directly in\\nthe fields where we have a particular interest, such as\\nthe fight against racism and xenophobia, and the rights\\nof the child. Belgium was actively involved in the\\nnegotiation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention\\non the Rights of the Child aimed at sparing children as\\nmuch as possible from the suffering and consequences\\nof armed conflict. The signing of that Protocol on the\\noccasion of the Millennium Summit, as well as our\\ncountry's signature of the second Protocol, on sexual\\nexploitation of children, are specific signs of our\\ncommon will to reinforce the protection of the rights of\\nthe child.\\nI would like to reiterate my country's wish to see\\nthe death penalty permanently abolished all over the\\nworld. I also appeal to countries that are not in a\\nposition to do so at this time to adopt a moratorium as\\na transitional measure. We certainly cannot accept the\\ndeath penalty still being implemented in cases of those\\nwho were minors at the time of the offence, pregnant\\nwomen or the mentally ill.\\nWe are following very closely the evolution of\\ninternational law and jurisprudence aimed at\\ncondemning persons convicted of crimes against\\nhumanity. My country has been at the forefront of\\nnational legislation in this context and hopes that these\\nmeasures can serve as a deterrent and an example for\\nother States. We have just ratified the Statute of the\\nInternational Criminal Court, and we are encouraging\\nother States to do the same in support of this important\\ncommitment.\\nLet me say a few words on globalization and its\\nproblems. Globalization is the expression of an\\ninevitable technological evolution. It makes little sense\\nto condemn this evolution as a whole, for it is natural\\nand has many positive effects, but we need to channel\\nits dynamics towards real economic and social progress\\nfor the well-being of a larger number of people. But the\\nglobalization of the economy and trade cannot simply\\nmean the renunciation of our political and institutional\\nresponsibilities. The risk is very real. We are already\\nwitnessing a form of abandonment of responsibilities in\\nthe case of Governments and Parliaments confronted\\nby the gigantic challenges of globalization and the\\nalmost impossible task of dealing with them at the\\nnational level. In the absence of a really effective and\\nrecognized global authority, the dynamics of\\nglobalization could lead us into a political vacuum.\\nThere will be no new economic world order without a\\nnew political world order in which national democratic\\ninstitutions, politically representative and accountable,\\ncan play a role. This is another challenge facing our\\nOrganization and its Member States. We will have to\\nprovide an answer in the new millennium.\\nThe United Nations system is at the heart of the\\nissue of globalization, whose effects are becoming\\n\\n\\nmore and more evident. Questions have been raised;\\nnow it is time to find the answers. We are convinced\\nthat only the United Nations system, with all its\\nspheres of activity, is in a position to harmonize global\\neconomic development with human development.\\nHere, more than anywhere else, we realize that human\\nbeings, wherever they come from, share a high degree\\nof common aspirations, as well as the same fears, the\\nsame needs and the same dreams. This belief has to\\nguide us in all our actions, both here and at home.\\n\\n\\n \", \"“We, the\\npeoples” is a powerful rendition of world affairs and a\\ndaunting portrait of life for future generations. It took\\nintellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complex\\ncase in such a concise and forceful way. We are\\ngrateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for\\nproducing it.\\n“We, the peoples” are of course the opening\\nwords of the Charter, and I want to take them as a point\\nof departure. Other speakers have done so before me\\nand have argued in favour of a more robust structure\\nfor keeping the peace in the world community. They\\nare right. The United Nations role in the area of\\npreventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived as\\nits principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shown\\nhow, in spite of that, the United Nations peacekeeping\\nfunction has in fact become its Achilles heel. The\\nBrahimi recommendations deserve to be\\nimplemented — the sooner the better. At present, the\\nNetherlands Government and parliament are debating\\nhow to improve our national contribution to\\npeacekeeping.\\n15\\n\\n“We, the Peoples” can lead to reflections on a\\ntotally different side of the United Nations reality as\\nwell. I, for one, would take this opportunity to argue in\\nfavour of closer ties between the United Nations and\\nthe private sector.\\nIn 1945 the world was run by States. The Charter\\nhinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects of\\nlife as they were prevalent at the time, from peace and\\nsecurity to social justice, from economic cooperation to\\nhuman rights. Despite its ambition, the Charter hardly\\nmentions any other actors besides States. Non-\\ngovernmental organizations appear in the Charter only\\nonce. The private sector is not referred to at all. In\\nother words, the Charter conforms to a model of\\ngovernance as old as the Peace of Westphalia, a state\\nsystem going back to the mid-1600s.\\nIn order to strategize for the future, we need to\\nask ourselves: who, in actual fact, runs the world\\ntoday; where and how are world affairs conducted; and\\nhow can we position the United Nations accordingly?\\nThe United Nations is made up of Member States.\\nThat is fitting and proper. States will be the custodians\\nof foreign relations for a long time to come. But their\\nroles have changed significantly with time. States can\\nno longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls of\\ninternational relations. Internationalization has altered\\nthe concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomous\\nentities as before, pursuing self-defined national\\ninterests. Their actions are now much more shaped by\\neconomic pressures, information flows, and population\\nmovements. For States, too, globalization is here to\\nstay. Other actors have entered both the domestic and\\ninternational scenes. Civil society is one. The private\\nsector is another. Since 1945, civil society, made up of\\nnon-profit organizations, has blossomed along a wide\\nspectrum, beyond any expectation of the United\\nNations founding fathers. Many non-governmental\\norganizations operate across national boundaries. At\\nthe present time, the United Nations system could\\nnever hope to operate properly without the assistance\\nof non-governmental organizations, not to mention\\nnormative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmental\\norganizations have acquired access to the United\\nNations at different levels, and participate in many of\\nits discussions.\\nAlthough a potent actor on the domestic and\\ninternational levels, the private sector has been\\nvirtually ignored by traditional United Nations\\ndiplomacy. The business community, and notably\\ntransnational corporations, were viewed by many as the\\ncompetitor, if not as the enemy of international public\\ninterest. Documents critical of multinationals were\\nbeing issued by the United Nations and the specialized\\nagencies until recently. Confrontation rather than\\ndialogue. I am not contending that there were no\\ngrounds for that position: quite the contrary. However,\\nnowadays we see a growing awareness in the business\\ncommunity of the necessity of responsible corporate\\npolicies and of a role for private enterprise in the\\npursuit of interests that go beyond maximizing\\nimmediate profits. As an example, I refer to the Global\\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization, in which the\\npharmaceutical industry closely cooperates with\\ninternational organizations, Governments and other\\nactors.\\nWe need to build on that. Indeed, the time has\\ncome to expand the concept of a partnership with the\\nprivate sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all, the\\nworld is up against incredible odds and, secondly, the\\nprivate sector does exist and wields a lot of power in\\nthe international arena.\\nAbout the odds: take a sustainable future, where\\nelementary laws of ecology must be respected. Not\\neven the most powerful Government can put a stop to\\nglobal warming — nor all the Member States of the\\nUnited Nations combined. A sustainable future needs\\nto be pursued in conjunction with industry, civil society\\nand the scientific community. For equitable working\\nconditions, and other forms of social justice, States\\nneed to involve the private sector. The same is true for\\nfighting corruption, the spread of small arms, wasting\\nwater or AIDS.\\nWe have truly entered an era that is very different\\nfrom the one in which the United Nations was born —\\nan era in which the course of humanity and the quality\\nof life on earth have more and more become a shared\\nresponsibility; an era where Governments, the private\\nsector and civil society are drawn ever more closely\\ntogether. They all have a stake in global governance.\\nThe so-called global public goods are a matter for all of\\nthem together.\\nThe private sector has a stake in the future of the\\nplanet, too. Of course, it is here to do business. But no\\nplanet, no profit. Companies should find it in their own\\ninterest to assume a responsibility equal to their weight\\nin international relations and the influence they have at\\n16\\n\\nthe domestic level. Chief executive officers, too, want\\na livable world for their grandchildren. The private\\nsector must be called upon to enter into a responsible\\ncorporate partnership in sync with other actors at the\\ninternational plane. True, the role of each actor needs\\nto be different. Their motivation can remain different,\\ntoo — as does the legal basis on which they act. But\\ntheir determination needs to be the same: the\\ndetermination to secure the longevity of life as we\\nknow it and to secure for everyone on the planet an\\nequitable share of its bounty.\\nDifferent roles, shared responsibility. That\\nconcept needs to take root in this Organization as well.\\nThe United Nations cannot credibly hope to play a\\ngalvanizing role in meeting the challenges of the\\ncoming century if it cannot show that its debates and\\nits action platforms reflect the real world outside the\\nconference rooms. If we want to see the United Nations\\nas “unique in world affairs” — as the Millennium\\nreport puts it — it must be able to show that all players\\nare on the stage.\\nThe Secretary-General's Global Compact could\\nnot have come at a more opportune moment. It is the\\nmere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising\\nstart. The Global Compact deserves the active support\\nof the international community, and it deserves to be\\njoined by other multinationals. I do understand the\\ntrepidations of some non-governmental organizations\\nwho fear that multinational corporations will drape\\nthemselves in the United Nations flag and become\\nuntouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too,\\nthe apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who\\nhave a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State\\nand its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the\\nGlobal Compact is not a Trojan horse.\\nAnd I will go even further. We have given civil\\nsociety structural access to the United Nations system.\\nBy contrast, the access we are giving to the private\\nsector, with the notable exception of the International\\nLabour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural.\\nIn the future, we must create appropriate channels of\\ncommunication with the private sector, inside this\\nOrganization, where they, as well as Governments and\\ncivil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions\\nof our time — a forum where, at the very least, they\\ncan deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of\\nmistrust that have divided them for so long.\\nThat is the first reason why the United Nations\\nneeds to broaden its scope and become more inclusive.\\nThe second is the power of the private sector. Many\\ncompanies have turnovers larger than the national\\nbudgets of some Member States, and the same is true\\nfor the personal fortunes of some chief executive\\nofficers. The relationship between States and the\\nprivate sector has altered dramatically over time. States\\nwere once thought of as bulwarks against harmful\\neconomic impact from abroad. Economic weight was\\nviewed as a trump card in the power play among\\nnations. Today, States are increasingly serving as\\ninstruments for adjusting domestic policy to the\\nrealities of the present-day world economy. They have\\nbecome intermediaries between the world economy,\\nwith its own structure of power, and domestic societies.\\nThis brings up the question of where world affairs\\nare being conducted and how they have caused a shift\\nin the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has\\nshifted the focus of attention to forums other than the\\nUnited Nations here in New York, notably to the\\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the\\nWorld Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the\\nEuropean Union. Policies are tested in the margins of\\nthe World Economic Forum in Davos or decided\\nelsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs.\\nThat focus has brought on a different cast of players\\nthan in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign\\nMinisters now work shoulder to shoulder not only with\\ndevelopment ministers, but also with finance and trade\\nministers, as well as with central bankers. International\\naffairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about\\neconomics.\\nForging a relationship with the private sector is\\ntherefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to\\npreserve its relevance over the long haul. The\\nmultilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties\\nwith other centres of power and with the business\\ncommunity. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously\\npursuing closer relations with all these various forums,\\nand we encourage him to do more of the same.\\nResponsible corporate partnership is also about\\nprotecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not\\nonly to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure\\nfreedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages,\\nglobalization is leaving too many victims by the\\nwayside. The gap between the rich and the poor\\ncontinues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in\\nwar and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields\\n17\\n\\na great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will\\nbuy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly\\non the quality of life in many developing countries.\\nEven though the odds are staggering, the United\\nNations system can make a difference in reducing\\npoverty, gender inequality and child and maternal\\nmortality. But it can make a difference only from a\\nposition of strength and from a platform shared by\\nother actors at the international level: from a position\\nof shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has\\ndeclared poverty eradication the United Nations\\nnumber one priority. We applaud that. But fighting\\npoverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has\\nbeen; it has also become an economic one. That is\\nanother reason for the United Nations to become more\\ninclusive of the private sector.\\nThe Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), “We\\nthe peoples”, duly poses the question of how to take\\nthe United Nations forward. Whatever the way\\nforward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we\\nhave been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we\\nhave kept the United Nations on a very short leash,\\nhardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of\\nthe same is not enough. In other words, the United\\nNations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples,\\npursue our business as usual. The future will pass us\\nby.\\nThe alternative is an avenue that is much more\\nambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations\\nsystem as a vehicle for the development of a new\\nvision of world politics, a vision for the “post-\\nWestphalian” era. In such a vision, present trends\\nwould be given legitimacy and a conceptual\\nframework. In such a vision, the principle of non-\\nintervention yields to the defence of human rights;\\nsovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for\\ncivil society and the private sector; and economics are\\nalso held responsible for social and development goals.\\nSuch is the road less travelled, but the only one that\\ncan make all the difference.\", \"First of all I\\nwould like to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your\\nelection as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\\nGeneral Assembly, and wish you every success with\\nyour work. I would like to thank Foreign Minister\\nGurirab for his dedication in chairing the fifty-fourth\\nsession of the General Assembly. I welcome Tuvalu as\\nthe one hundred and eighty-ninth member of the United\\nNations and congratulate it on its accession. I endorse\\nthe statement of my French colleague, Hubert VÈdrine,\\non behalf of the European Union.\\nAt this session of the General Assembly, the first\\nin the new millennium, we are asked to determine the\\nfuture tasks of the United Nations and which reforms\\nare necessary in order to master them. The Millennium\\nDeclaration, which we all adopted on 8 September,\\nshows us the way forward. The implementation of this\\nDeclaration should be a main focus of the consultations\\nof this and future sessions of the General Assembly. I\\npropose that the Secretary-General make use of the\\nopportunity to draw up review reports at the beginning\\nof the next session of the General Assembly.\\nThere was one issue in particular which\\ndominated this debate, namely globalization. It will\\nradically change the economy and finances, politics\\nand culture everywhere. The question is, will a new\\norder which guarantees peace, justice and an equal\\nshare in our common progress be established or will a\\nnew divide evolve in the world? Will the future of the\\nglobalized world manifest its pluralist character in a\\nmultilateral order? Only the future can provide the\\nanswers to these questions.\\nParticularly for developing countries,\\nglobalization offers great opportunities. If it\\nnevertheless provokes strong opposition, this lies in the\\nimbalances of this historical process. Indeed, just under\\na decade after the end of the cold war, our world is\\ntoday at risk from a new divide, one between the\\nwinners and losers of the economic globalization\\nprocess. In his impressive Millennium Report, the\\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, rightly highlights\\nthe growing inequalities in the distribution of income,\\nresources, investments and access to new technologies.\\nIn view of this situation, the international\\ncommunity must make every effort in the coming\\ndecade to ensure that globalization benefits all peoples.\\nIf market forces are not balanced by a political\\ncorrective mechanism, it is to be expected that injustice\\nin the world will increase further. Those who have been\\nhitherto excluded from the advantages of globalization\\nmust be included to a greater extent. They must be\\ngiven more say in the political decisions made about\\nsteering global processes and they must be given an\\nopportunity to gain a fairer share in the development of\\nthe world economy.\\nIn the twenty-first century, we will, more than\\never before, need a form of global governance if we are\\nto solve global challenges. The United Nations will\\nplay a key role here. It is the only organization within\\nwhich the injustice between rich and poor can be\\novercome and where a reconciliation between peoples\\nand regions, global peace and sustainable development\\ncan be achieved.\\nGreatly strengthening the United Nations capacity\\nto act is, therefore, a crucial question for the whole of\\n15\\n\\nhumanity in the twenty-first century. In addition to the\\ncrucial reform of the Security Council, this will entail\\nthe United Nations entering into creative partnerships\\nwith industry and civil society.\\nGermany strongly supports the Secretary-\\nGeneral's idea for a global compact with major\\ncompanies. The German initiative for a resolution in\\nthe General Assembly on global partnerships will take\\nup this and other issues relating to the globalization\\nprocess.\\nGlobal poverty is the key problem in North-South\\nrelations. It lies at the root of many global risks and\\nthreats to peace. The Secretary-General provided\\nprecise and stimulating analyses of this in his report.\\nThe industrialized nations have a special\\nobligation to support the poorest of the poor. With the\\nCologne debt initiative launched by Germany, we are\\ncombining debt relief with a strategy to combat\\npoverty. The 20 poorest developing countries should be\\ndebt-free by the end of the year.\\nThe least developed countries should be granted\\naccess to world markets with the greatest possible\\nexemption from duties and quotas. We must, also by\\nway of liberalization steps in the World Trade\\nOrganization, prevent these countries from being\\nsocially excluded even further.\\nThis applies in particular to the new economy.\\nThe United Nations and its Member States must\\nintensify their efforts to make it easier for these\\ncountries to use the information and communication\\ntechnologies. This is contingent upon initiatives in the\\nfield of education, as well as the availability of the\\nnecessary resources.\\nHowever, how can poor countries ever catch up\\neconomically if they are, at the same time, afflicted to a\\nmuch greater degree than the North by terrible\\ndiseases? The fight against the disastrous spread of the\\nAIDS virus, particularly in Africa, must be priority for\\nus all. The focus must be on prevention. At the same\\ntime, access to medicines must be improved and\\nvaccine research must be intensified. The World Bank's\\npromising idea of establishing a future fund for the\\npurchase of vaccines deserves every support.\\nParticularly in the fight against AIDS, new partnerships\\nbetween Governments and companies are crucial.\\nThe second major issue of this General Assembly\\nis peacekeeping. The Secretary-General showed the\\nway ahead with the Brahimi report. The\\nrecommendations it contains should be examined and\\nimplemented as quickly as possible. Germany will play\\nits part. Peace missions need a more robust mandate, as\\nwell as more personnel and equipment. Member States\\nmust do considerably more to ensure the rapid\\nsecondment of well-trained troops, police officers and\\ncivilian experts. The further development of the police\\nconcept is one of the most important tasks in this\\nconnection  as the last few months and years have, in\\nfact been teaching us.\\nThe German Government will offer German\\ntraining for civilian peace-mission personnel and offer\\ncivilian capacities to the United Nations stand-by\\nsystem. In addition, we are drafting a plan for training\\ncivilian experts for peace missions, thus creating a pool\\nof qualified personnel who can be deployed at short\\nnotice.\\nThe prevailing form of conflict today is conflict\\nwithin States. Therefore the main task of peacekeeping\\nmust be to address the internal roots of conflicts. In\\naddition to focusing on an improvement in socio-\\neconomic conditions, our efforts must focus on\\npromoting human rights, democracy and the rule of\\nlaw. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights, aptly said that the\\nhuman rights violations of today are the wars of\\ntomorrow.\\nNumerous concrete tasks are on the agenda. The\\nprotocols relating to the involvement of children in\\narmed conflict and to the sale of children, child\\nprostitution and child pornography must enter into\\nforce as early as possible. The equality of women must\\nbe advanced in all spheres. I call upon all states to\\nratify quickly the new Optional Protocol to the\\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\\nDiscrimination against Women and to abolish all laws\\nthat discriminate against women by 2005. The World\\nConference against racism, to be held in 2001, must\\ntackle all aspects of this issue. Out of a sense of\\nresponsibility for our history, our State and our society\\nwill stand up firmly against all forms of right-wing\\nradicalism, racism and anti-Semitism, both in our own\\ncountry and in the world.\\nI call upon all States to respect the integrity of the\\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, to sign and\\nto ratify it, so that the Court can commence work soon.\\nThere can be no exceptions to the Rome Statute.\\n16\\n\\nOne of the greatest dangers facing humanity\\nremains the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction. The risk of regional arms races,\\nparticularly in South Asia, has increased. Further\\ndeveloping the international arms-control regime\\ntherefore continues to be one of the United Nations key\\ntasks. This will require resolute implementation of the\\nresults of the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to\\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons. Against this background, President Clinton's\\ndecision not to commit now to the development of a\\nnational missile defence system is very welcome. The\\nAnti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty must remain as a\\ncornerstone of strategic stability and the basis for\\nfurther nuclear-disarmament measures.\\nIn poor countries the excessive stockpiling of\\nsmall arms must be stopped. We must therefore do\\neverything we can to achieve tangible progress at the\\nUnited Nations small arms conference to be held in\\n2001. This presupposes the inclusion of all aspects,\\nincluding the legal transfer of production and\\nstockpiles.\\nRegional cooperation has proved to be an\\nextremely effective means of preventing conflicts. The\\nUnited Nations can do much to help here. Allow me to\\nmention two regions where progress is particularly\\nurgent. The triangle between Central Asia, the\\nCaucasus and the Middle East is full of destabilizing\\nfactors  oil, religious fundamentalism, terrorism,\\ndrugs and the nuclear arms race  and this area is\\nthreatening to become the crisis region of the century\\nahead. A new comprehensive regional process, along\\nthe lines of the Helsinki model, which fosters\\ncooperation instead of confrontation, could play an\\nimportant stabilizing role. Germany is prepared to take\\npart in such a process.\\nIn Africa, regional approaches have gained in\\nsignificance. In the main, however, it is, unfortunately,\\ntoo early to talk of effective peacekeeping structures.\\nUnfortunately, the efforts on the part of the United\\nNations and of the Organization of African Unity to\\nresolve the conflicts in the Congo and Sierra Leone\\nhave not achieved a breakthrough so far. In the conflict\\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea it is to be hoped that the\\nceasefire that has finally been concluded will be\\nconsolidated and that the United Nations peace mission\\nwill be lent the full support of the parties to the\\nconflict.\\nThe third issue, protection of our natural\\nenvironment, will probably become the crucial issue\\naffecting our planet. In the course of the twentieth\\ncentury the world's population quadrupled, while\\nconsumption of energy and raw materials increased\\ntenfold. We must end the squandering of natural\\nresources and switch to renewable energy sources as\\nquickly as possible. This cannot only be a matter for\\nindustrialized nations. We are witnessing at this very\\nmoment what a burden high oil prices places on poor\\ncountries in particular. It must be in the interest of all\\nStates to bring about the transition from the oil to the\\nhydrogen age as quickly as possible. The most\\nimportant thing now is to finally overcome the\\ndeadlock in the climate-protection negotiations and to\\nensure that the Kyoto Protocol can be implemented by\\n2002, 10 years after the Rio Summit.\\nAnother key issue for humanity, the future of\\ngenetic engineering, can only be mastered within the\\nframework of a global consensus. Genetic engineering\\nhas the potential to revolutionalize medicine and\\nagriculture. At the same time, it raises more ethical and\\nhuman rights questions than any other technology. Do\\nwe not need clear, binding rules for dealing with such a\\npowerful new technology? Why do we not seriously\\nconsider within the United Nations creating under\\ninternational law a convention that meaningfully\\npromotes genetic engineering and safeguards the\\nfreedom to research and the findings of this research,\\nwhile, at the same time, defining an ethical basis and\\nguaranteeing protection against abuse?\\nThe Millennium Declaration points the way\\nahead. But what help will that be if an increasing\\nnumber of Members allow the world's real problems to\\nbe dealt with and decided somewhere else? If we do\\nnot succeed in adapting the United Nations to deal with\\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century and in\\nmodernizing it fully, it will be sidelined, with fatal\\nconsequences for peace and development, human\\nrights, the environment and social progress.\\nWe will all, rich and poor, lose out.\\nWe must therefore muster the strength to\\nresolutely implement the Millennium Declaration. We\\nneed a world Organization that is strong and we must\\nuse its scarce resources more effectively. An important\\nprerequisite for this is that the United Nations be\\nplaced finally on a solid financial footing. Together\\nwith its European Union partners, Germany has put\\n17\\n\\nforward proposals for a fairer, more balanced scale of\\nassessments, which must continue to be based on\\nMember States' ability to pay..\\nThe Security Council no longer reflects the\\npolitical reality of our world at the dawn of the new\\nmillennium. We share the Secretary-General's view\\nthat this central steering organ of the international\\ncommunity must become more representative,\\nlegitimate and effective, also involving the developing\\ncountries. Last week Chancellor Schroeder reaffirmed\\nGermany's willingness to take on more responsibility\\nin this connection. I would like to take this opportunity\\nto thank my friend and colleague Robin Cook for the\\nclear language that he used before the General\\nAssembly just a few minutes ago.\\nThe General Assembly must structure its work,\\ndebate global problems in a more focused fashion than\\nhitherto and identify courses of action. The synergetic\\npotential between United Nations organizations, for\\nexample in the environmental field, must be better used\\nand resources pooled to a greater extent by merging\\norganizations.\\nReform of the United Nations will play a decisive\\nrole in ensuring that the twenty-first century is safer\\nand more just than the twentieth century. Allow me to\\nconclude with a quote from the Secretary-General's\\nMillennium Report:\\nNo shift in the way we think or act can be\\nmore critical than this: we must put people at the\\ncentre of everything we do ... Only when that\\nbegins to happen will we know that globalization\\nis indeed becoming inclusive, allowing everyone\\nto share its opportunities.'\", '\\ufeffOnly a few moments ago, we were informed of the\\ncrash of a commercial airliner not far from here, in\\nQueens. At the moment, we do not know the cause of\\nthis disaster, but we are shocked and horrified. I would\\nexpress to the bereaved families and to the American\\npeople our sincere condolences and sympathy.\\nIt has been only two months since thousands of\\ninnocent persons lost their lives in the World Trade\\nCenter here in New York. Today, we are seeing the\\nextent to which the people here have been affected. In\\nthe entire history of the United Nations, there has never\\nbeen a situation like this one.\\nThroughout the world, people have expressed\\ntheir sincere solidarity with and commiseration for the\\nvictims and their families. These horrific terrorist\\nattacks struck not just Americans, but also innocent\\npeople from over 80 countries, members of all the\\nmajor world religions and cultures. They targeted us\\nall. It must therefore be a common concern of humanity\\nto prevent a recurrence of this tragedy or indeed\\nsomething even worse.\\nThe events of 11 September thrust a dangerous\\nfuture upon the world. We now live in the terrible\\nknowledge that no country in the globalized world is\\ninvulnerable and that enemies within, who are\\ndetermined to kill and to die, can perpetrate mass\\nmurder at any time. This eerie, awful danger has at a\\nstroke dramatically altered the foundations of security\\npolicy as we know it. The fight against internationally\\noperative terrorist networks will require new responses\\nfrom the community of States. International terrorism\\nis a challenge above all for politics, the military, the\\npolice and the judiciary, as well as for the economy\\nand — very importantly — for culture. At the dawn of\\nthe twenty-first century, the issue of peace and security\\nhas thus taken on an entirely new perspective.\\nHumanity has rarely been as united as it was on\\nthat terrible day two months ago. This unity was born\\nnot only of horror and compassion, but also of the\\nrealization that we can successfully counter this new\\ndeadly threat only if we combine our full force and\\nenergy. The day of 11 September was a defining\\nmoment that altered the direction of world politics. A\\nnew alliance was created. It must now be strengthened\\nand developed into a genuine partnership. If this is\\nachieved, 11 September could go down in history not\\nonly as a horrific day for humanity, but also as the\\nbeginning of a new era of cooperation and\\nmultilateralism.\\nWhat drives people to commit these\\ninconceivable crimes and to blow up themselves and\\nthousands of innocents? From where does such\\nuncontrollable hatred come? How can it be curbed?\\nHow can it be conquered? It is certain that in any\\nattempt to develop an effective counter-strategy we\\nmust, while waging the war on terrorism, analyse the\\nfull range of causes and circumstances that permit such\\nhatred and violence to grow.\\nThe United Nations is uniquely suited to the task\\nahead. It provides the forum required for the creation\\n12\\n\\nof a universal coalition. Only it can give international\\nlegitimacy to the response to terrorism. It has at its\\ndisposal the instruments to manage political conflicts\\nand the underlying development problems that nurture\\nhatred and despair.\\nA comprehensive strategy against terrorism must\\nconcentrate primarily on prevention. Developing such a\\nstrategy means nothing less than drafting a policy for a\\ncooperative world order for the twenty-first century, a\\npolicy that no longer tolerates areas characterized by a\\nbreakdown of order, a policy that has as its goal a\\nworld order under which all peoples can claim their\\nfull and equitable share. This includes making\\neconomic globalization more socially just for more\\npeople and supplementing it with the political\\nglobalization so urgently needed.\\nThe Security Council responded to 11 September\\nwith rare solidarity and, with resolutions 1368 (2001)\\nand 1373 (2001), took decisions on concrete,\\ninternationally binding anti-terrorism measures that\\npoint the way ahead. The General Assembly, too,\\nseverely condemned the terrorist attacks and called for\\njoint action against international terrorism.\\nThis path must now be rigorously pursued with\\nthe rapid and universal ratification and implementation\\nof the 12 United Nations anti-terrorism conventions\\nand the adoption of a comprehensive convention on\\ninternational terrorism. We must endeavour anew to\\nbring this project, on which we all place so much hope,\\nto a successful conclusion. I therefore call upon all\\nStates that have not yet approved the present\\ncompromise to reconsider their position.\\nThe International Criminal Court can also become\\na valuable instrument in the fight against terrorism.\\nUnder article 7, paragraph 1, of its statute, it will have\\njurisdiction to try cases of murder “when committed as\\npart of a widespread or systematic attack directed\\nagainst any civilian population”. There can be no doubt\\nthat the attacks on New York, Washington and\\nPennsylvania fulfil this requirement. For this reason, I\\nwould like to ask you all once again to ratify the Rome\\nStatute as quickly as possible.\\nThe attack on the World Trade Center was a\\nwake-up call to the profound threat to world peace that\\ncan be posed by failing States. Areas where political\\nand social order has collapsed offer terrorists a safe\\nhaven from which they can organize their murderous\\nnetworks worldwide. The community of States urgently\\nneeds to take a closer and preventive look at the\\nproblem of failing States — but not just in\\nAfghanistan, and not only after a catastrophe has\\noccurred.\\nNo conflict prevention measures have ever been\\nundertaken in Afghanistan. Far from it. This has\\nproved to be a fatal error. For more than 20 years, a\\nhumanitarian catastrophe has been playing itself out\\nbefore the eyes of the world, in which women and\\nchildren, in particular, have suffered. Civil war, human\\nrights violations and abject misery have also been the\\nnourishing ground for the unprecedented symbiosis\\nbetween the terrorists of the Al Qaeda group and the\\nTaliban regime.\\nFrom there the trail leads directly to the horrific\\nattacks in the United States. As hard as this decision\\nmay be, without the use of military means, this threat\\ncannot be averted. We must not forget that the suffering\\nof the people in Afghanistan is above all the work of\\nthe Taliban. It was the Taliban that, long before 11\\nSeptember, increasingly impeded effective\\nhumanitarian relief, robbed women and girls of all their\\nrights and actively supported terrorism, also with the\\ngoal of destabilizing Arab and Muslim States.\\nNot to react would indeed be to invite further\\nterror and oppression and would be extremely\\ndangerous for world peace. The dramatic nature of this\\nthreat is illustrated by Osama bin Laden’s statement\\nthat he will not shrink from using even nuclear\\nweapons. Civilian means alone are unfortunately not\\nalways enough to put an end to violence and terror.\\nThis was the case in the Balkans.\\nIn Afghanistan, too, the root of the tragic conflict\\nis profoundly political, and so the solution, too, can\\nultimately only be a political one. It must come from\\nwithin, must reflect the diversity of peoples in Afghan\\nsociety and must be accepted by the Afghan people.\\nBut a peaceful solution also requires assistance from\\nthe international community. Afghanistan must not be\\nleft alone with its problems yet again.\\nA clear political and humanitarian perspective for\\nAfghanistan is now crucial. The United Nations should\\nbe the coordinating agency for all peace efforts. It is\\nindispensable as the framework for the political\\nprocess and as the guarantor of internal agreements\\nwithin Afghanistan. Only a peace process under the\\nauspices of the United Nations will succeed in\\nexcluding external involvement in the future and\\n13\\n\\nensuring a peaceful future for the country in harmony\\nwith its neighbours. Germany and the European Union\\nare willing to play their part towards a political\\nsolution for Afghanistan and to participate in the long\\nterm in the economic and social reconstruction of\\nAfghanistan.\\nMore than anything, the refugees and the civilian\\npopulation must be helped. We cannot tolerate the fact\\nthat the Taliban is hindering humanitarian access and is\\nusing the civilian population as a shield. Especially\\nbecause of the approaching winter, we must do\\neverything in our power to provide the people with at\\nleast the most basic necessities and to alleviate their\\ndespair and hardship. Is it possible to establish\\nhumanitarian protected areas, to use the expulsion of\\nthe Taliban from Mazar-e-Sharif and other towns to\\nimprove the humanitarian situation, and to make a\\ntown like Kabul an open city? Of course this will be\\nvery difficult, but let us nevertheless think without\\ntaboos about absolutely all ways in which we could\\nhelp the people. As chair of the Afghanistan Support\\nGroup, Germany has issued an invitation to a meeting\\nin Berlin at the beginning of December. I appeal to all\\nStates to make a great humanitarian effort now and to\\ncome to the aid of the downtrodden Afghan people.\\nSolving regional conflicts will be of critical\\nimportance in the fight against terrorism. The Middle\\nEast conflict is a top priority. Our hearts go out to the\\nmany innocent victims on all sides. Both the Israeli and\\nPalestinian peoples have a right to live free of fear, in\\ndignity and in peace. This is indivisible not only from\\nIsrael’s right of statehood, as recognized in Madrid —\\nwhich is, in our view, inviolable — but also from its\\nsecurity. Germany bears a special responsibility\\ntowards Israel stemming from its past. Any policy that\\naims at destroying Israel by means of terrorism or\\notherwise will face determined opposition from\\nGermany. However, we equally advocate the\\nPalestinians’ right to self-determination and their right\\nto their own State, Palestine. In the European Union\\nBerlin Declaration of March 1999 we stated that “the\\ncreation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign\\nPalestinian State on the basis of existing agreements\\nand through negotiations would be the best guarantee\\nof Israel’s security”. This is truer today than ever\\nbefore.\\nNever before has there been broader international\\nbacking for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\\nconflict. The Mitchell recommendations still form the\\nbasis for the timetable accepted by all sides, and in\\ntheir spirit we call on Israelis and Palestinians alike to\\nput an immediate and lasting end to violence and\\nconfrontation, to resume the agreed direct talks without\\ndelay and to seriously implement the negotiated\\nceasefires. These talks must lead to genuine\\nnegotiations on a viable political solution.\\nThe real aim of the terrorists is to trigger a clash\\nof civilizations and to inflame the situation in the Near\\nand Middle East. Under no circumstances can we allow\\nourselves to be drawn into such a conflict. We are\\nfighting international terrorism, not Islam.\\nWe must counter the terrorist strategy designed to\\nbring about the clash of civilizations with a dialogue of\\ncultures and religions. We need a spiritual debate based\\non mutual understanding that attempts to reach genuine\\nagreement on the fundamental values that unite us.\\nSuch a dialogue presupposes the existence of shared\\nvalues, but also respect for other traditions and\\ndifferences between peoples. However, one thing must\\nbe clear: human rights are universal, not Western\\nvalues. Consensus was reached on them by the\\ninternational community of States in the Charter of the\\nUnited Nations and the human rights conventions.\\nAny dialogue must build on the universality of\\nhuman rights. It must be conducted with respect for the\\ndignity of all involved, in tolerance and openness. It\\nmust start at home, within cultures themselves. It can\\nbear fruit only if it is pursued free of all constraint.\\nAnd it has a purpose only if all participants are also\\nready to offer self-criticism.\\nThe insidious anthrax attacks since 11 September\\nshow that the threat from weapons of mass destruction\\nin terrorist hands, which yesterday seemed abstract, is\\ntoday a real and deadly danger. The community of\\nStates must do everything in its power to counter it\\nwith a new push for non-proliferation and global\\ndisarmament.\\nThe dangers of the dissemination of weapons to\\nnon-State groups and of regional arms races require\\nnew answers and effective, internationally enforceable\\ncriminal sanctions. In the nuclear field, the\\ncommitment contained in the Non-Proliferation Treaty\\nto complete nuclear disarmament remains crucial. As\\nregards biological weapons, in view of the acute threat,\\neffective global control mechanisms must finally be\\ncreated. The Chemical Weapons Convention must be\\nmore rigorously implemented. All States are called\\n14\\n\\nupon to participate in the negotiation of an\\ninternational code of conduct on ballistic missile\\nproliferation.\\nThe fight now beginning against terrorism must\\nbuild on the awareness that the first world cannot in the\\nlong term live secure and safe from the tensions and\\nconflicts of the third world. Almost one quarter of the\\nworld population is starving. Ninety-five per cent of\\nthose infected with AIDS live in developing countries.\\nAfrica is particularly hard hit. At present only a\\nminority of the world’s citizens profit from the\\nopportunities for growth offered by globalization and\\nfrom the use of the new information technologies. This\\nstate of affairs cannot be accepted, even by the rich\\ncountries — for moral reasons, but also because\\ntensions and conflicts today spread much more quickly\\nand widely than ever before.\\nThe battle against poverty cannot be won unless\\nwe take equally determined steps to preserve the\\nnatural resources on which life depends. At the coming\\nWorld Summit in Johannesburg we must make a\\nquantum leap forward towards sustainable\\ndevelopment, improved poverty eradication and better\\nmanagement of our natural resources. The Kyoto\\nProtocol must enter into force next year. And we must\\nstrengthen the sole advocate of the global environment,\\nthe United Nations Environment Programme,\\ninstitutionally, operationally and financially.\\n11 September made it horrifyingly clear that the\\nhuman race will not be able to live in peace and\\nsecurity in the absence of political order at the global\\nand regional levels.\\nGermany will continue to do its utmost to bring\\nabout the strengthening of the United Nations and its\\ncapacity to act, so that the world will be a more\\npeaceful, just and humane place in the twenty-first\\ncentury than it was in the twentieth century. The future\\nbelongs to responsible governance for one world,\\ngovernance based not on hegemonic claims, but on\\ncooperation, solidarity and multilateralism. If together\\nwe succeed in implementing such a policy, we will not\\njust ultimately win the war against terrorism but will\\nalso be able to eradicate its roots forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffHow can anyone\\nstand on the smoking ashes of “ground zero” and not\\nbe overwhelmed by disbelief, anger, and frustration?\\nHow can anyone escape the enormity of what happened\\nin September or not feel compassion for all those who\\nhave lost someone dear to them? At “ground zero” we\\nnot only witness death and destruction, but we also see\\nhow American values have come under siege. These\\nare shared values. That is why the people I represent\\nnow stand squarely behind the United States.\\n14\\n\\nNo matter how deeply moved we may be, we\\nmust look beyond our anger and frustration. Through\\nour tears, we should discover opportunity. Through our\\nbitterness, necessity. We must turn compassion into\\nsolidarity, turn solidarity into common action. We need\\na plan — in sum, we must turn to the United Nations.\\nThe reaction on the part of the United Nations\\nfrom the beginning of this crisis has been prompt and\\nresponsible. As we meet this week, we must try and\\nkeep the momentum going. And that is precisely what\\nwe are doing. There is something I have sensed in the\\nfirst few days of this general debate — namely,\\ndetermination — determination to use the United\\nNations to the fullest, on many different fronts, as a\\ncentre of gravity for our common actions — common\\naction for confronting a global threat — common\\naction to maintain the international order.\\nWith regard to that common action, what have we\\nlearned so far? Three lessons. Lesson number one: the\\nlaw must be firmly in place. There is a wealth of legal\\nrules to guide us in these difficult times, and more of\\nthem are on the way. A striking example of innovative\\nrule-making was presented by the Security Council.\\nBinding under Chapter VII of the United Nations\\nCharter, resolution 1373 (2001) takes action not in\\nregard to a specific threat or breach of the peace, not\\nagainst a particular Member State, but takes action to\\nconfront a phenomenon, a threat to our human values\\nand economic interests — action against unidentified\\nenemies. By writing new law, the Council has broken\\nnew ground. Even more so, as it has set up the\\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to monitor the\\nimplementation of its decision.\\nJointly with our partners in the European Union,\\nwe are taking the implementation of resolution 1373\\n(2001) very seriously. One aspect of it is especially\\nimportant to us: promoting ratification of all of the\\nvarious anti-terrorism conventions and monitoring\\ncompliance. My country has some expertise to offer\\nand will gladly share it. Meanwhile, an overarching\\nconvention against terrorism is in the works. That is\\ngood. But we are getting bogged down over a\\ndefinition of terrorism. That is bad. Let us not forget\\nthat it took us 20 years to produce a fairly useless\\ndefinition of aggression. The world cannot wait that\\nlong. Besides, when terrorism stares you in the face,\\nyou’ll know it.\\nIn addition to rule-making, the real challenge lies\\nin implementation. There, we should try harder. Let me\\ngive you one example. Just before the summer we lost\\nour momentum in the fight against biological warfare,\\nand therefore the fight against bio-terrorism as well.\\nThe world is a scary place. Anthrax is only one motive\\nfor retrieving that momentum. Let us resume our\\nefforts to turn the Biological Weapons Convention into\\nan instrument that can really make a difference.\\nThe need for stepping up security is immediate,\\ncomprehensive and self-evident. In the aftermath of 11\\nSeptember, nobody would deny it. But we need to be\\nconcerned with the downside of security as well. Parts\\nof our value system may come under pressure when\\nGovernments seek to bolster public safety, and by this I\\nmean human rights and fundamental freedoms. As\\nprivate citizens we must be ready to make concessions\\nand, yes, we will be forced to relinquish some freedom\\nfrom intrusion in our private lives. But we cannot be\\nexpected to live in a never-ending state of siege.\\nWherever we have to strike a balance, we have to do so\\nwisely. Long ago, we drew a line beyond which we\\ncannot step — we cannot detract from the basic\\nprinciples of human rights. Those principles are the\\ntrue measure of our evolution and our civilization. If\\nwe look the other way, we lose the moral high ground.\\nIf we compromise, we lose out to those who besiege us.\\nWhat is being put to the test here is our own\\nvalue system. The core notion of that system is\\ntolerance. Tolerance must, however, come from all\\nsides. Tolerance is not the equivalent of giving in to\\nintolerance. It does not imply that you bend at the\\nslightest pressure. Tolerance means that you stand up to\\nbe counted, that you draw a line in the sand when your\\nbasic values are challenged. That is lesson number one.\\nLesson number two: there are “black holes” in the\\ninternational order: failing States. We knew they were\\nthere all along, but we have never been quite sure how\\nto deal with them. Why should we care about failing\\nStates? For several reasons. Look at the avalanche of\\ndrugs, drug-money, weapons, and warlords spilling out\\nof Afghanistan. Look at the blood diamonds streaming\\nout of Africa. Think of how failing States attract\\nparasites and how they turn into breeding grounds for\\nterrorism, a haven for international crime. Think of\\npeace and security, too; of how faltering countries\\nbecome a liability to their own people; of how they\\nflaunt the rules of the game and become a liability to\\nthe whole neighbourhood.\\n15\\n\\nHow do we deal with failing States? That\\nquestion has never been answered in a systematic\\nmanner. Any answer begins by recognition on the part\\nof the Member States of this Organization that failing\\nStates are a problem. Indeed, it may turn out to be the\\nmost pernicious problem of the new century. From that\\npoint on, we need to build a strategy, and do so\\ntogether, within the framework of this Organization.\\nWhat are we aiming at? How ambitious are we?\\nCan we get in early to prevent failing States from\\nfailing? Are there any early warning signals to look out\\nfor? If we see those signals, do we have the means to\\nact? And the political will? Once States are failing, do\\nwe try and fix them? Do we settle for ending the\\nfighting, wherever fighting is going on? Or do we limit\\nourselves to humanitarian aid? These are all difficult\\nquestions.\\nMy belief is that outside intervention only goes so\\nfar. I do not believe that massive injections of aid are\\nthe right answer to failing States. For one thing, donors\\nare reluctant to poor money down a black hole. But\\nmore importantly: the solution should not come from\\nthe outside, but rather from the inside. Even in the\\npoorest country we will find well-educated citizens just\\nas committed to building better lives for their children\\nas in the rest of the world. They need a helping hand in\\nbuilding good governance and a viable civil society.\\nYet, ownership is paramount. Failing States, too, have\\nthe capacity to fix themselves. Indeed, only if they fix\\nthemselves will they no longer fail. Our role should be\\nto help galvanize and to enable those capacities.\\nLesson number three: the United Nations should\\nbe doing the right things. As of today the Northern\\nAlliance has entered the city of Kabul. That fact makes\\nit even more imperative that we speak about\\nAfghanistan in the United Nations.\\nConsensus is growing that in post-Taliban\\nAfghanistan, the United Nations should play a central\\nrole. I certainly support that view. But a central role in\\nwhat? For make no mistake: once the bombing stops,\\nthe difficulties are still overwhelming. The country is\\nnot only rugged and ruined, but also the size of Central\\nEurope and packed with landmines. Factional fighting\\nis bound to continue. The United Nations can do a lot,\\nbut we need to beware of sending the United Nations\\non an impossible mission. Instead of calling on the\\nUnited Nations for functions where it is weak, let us\\ncall on the United Nations for functions where it is\\nstrong.\\nFor example, take governance, a major worry to\\nus all. Much as we seek to avoid it, a political vacuum\\nis a realistic prospect, given that tribal conflict in\\nAfghanistan is as old as the country’s history. Afghans\\nare a proud people. Hostility towards outside\\nintervention is strong. The country needs to be\\ngoverned from within. We may be looking both for a\\nbroad-based interim Government and for a stable\\npermanent structure. Without rushing to elections, we\\nneed to be satisfied that such a political settlement is\\nsupported by the population. In the process, the United\\nNations might play a central role as a catalyst and as an\\nadviser, but not as a governor. Afghanistan is not East\\nTimor. It is important, too, that any settlement be\\nsupported by the neighbouring States and by a Security\\nCouncil resolution.\\nAs regards security: in the absence of a functional\\nnational army, transitional military arrangements are\\nessential. They are essential to create a secure\\nenvironment enabling reconstruction to begin and\\nrefugees to return home. Choosing the right format is\\ncritical. A conventional United Nations peacekeeping\\noperation may not be a good idea — certainly not for\\nthe country as a whole. Supplying peacekeepers is still\\nvoluntary. Realistically, the troop levels needed for a\\ncountry this size would almost certainly not be\\nattained. Bosnia has taught us the hard lesson of the\\nprice we pay when we send in a United Nations force\\nthat is below par. We should be careful to avoid another\\nSomalia. Different formats for security arrangements\\nare possible, and we should reflect on them as a whole.\\nIn a previous context, Ambassador Brahimi has offered\\nus a wide spectrum of lessons learned about United\\nNations peacekeeping. We should take them to heart.\\nNow, as the Special Representative, he deserves all the\\nsupport he needs from us.\\nConcerning mine clearance: Afghanistan has\\nmore landmines than any other country in the world.\\nThe country cannot possibly get back on its feet as long\\nas those mines are there. We have to get rid of them,\\nand the United Nations can help us to do that. We must\\npay the bills.\\nAs to reconstruction: we should capitalize on\\nwhere the United Nations is uniquely positioned either\\nto deploy operations in the field or to coordinate those\\nof others. Let us not limit our view to the part of the\\n16\\n\\nUnited Nations here in New York, but rather broaden it\\nto the entire United Nations system, including the\\nDumbarton Oaks and Bretton Woods institutions. We\\nneed to bring the full weight of that system to bear on\\nthe future of Afghanistan. I am speaking of the World\\nHealth Organization and the Office of the United\\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, of the Food\\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\\nand the United Nations Drug Control Programme, of\\nthe International Labour Organization and the World\\nFood Programme, of the United Nations Development\\nProgramme and the World Bank. There is no need to\\nset up a whole new mechanism. The Afghanistan\\nSupport Group is fully entrenched, and we should use\\nit.\\nEspecially now, caught in the crossfire, the\\nAfghan people are not to be envied. Their plight will\\nnot be over once the guns are silent. Food stocks,\\nhealth care, housing, utilities, schooling, agriculture —\\nthe list of concerns is a long one. But all of us need to\\npush that agenda. We may not be part of the problem of\\nAfghanistan, but we must be part of the solution.\\nYet again, reconstruction cannot be imposed upon\\na nation. Here, too, a sustainable recovery needs to\\ncome from within. All the men, and especially the\\nwomen of Afghanistan, must once again become the\\nmakers of their own fate and future. The answer lies\\nwith them.\\nThe United Nations is not merely “an ineffective\\nacronym”, as a misguided message on the Internet\\nwould have you believe. For global issues, multilateral\\ncooperation is the only answer. Multilateralism is\\nsolidarity worked into a plan. As I said, the reaction by\\nthe United Nations system in the aftermath of 11\\nSeptember has been prompt and responsible. In order\\nto maintain that level of performance, we, the Member\\nStates, will have to show the stamina, support and\\ncommitment to make it happen. Our track record is not\\nimpeccable. The United Nations can go no faster than\\nwe will let it, which means we have to make it work.\\nThis also means we have to provide it with all the\\nresources, and the political will, to give it the push and\\npunch we need.\\n\\n', '\\ufeffI am speaking\\nhere while still in shock over the terrible aeroplane\\ncrash in Queens, our immediate neighbourhood,\\nespecially since the area of Rockaway, where so many\\nbrave New York firefighters live, was already suffering\\nin the aftermath of the earlier catastrophe. I wish to\\nexpress my deep sympathy to all those families and to\\nthe great number of people affected by this tragedy.\\nLet me at the outset congratulate His Excellency\\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to this high office.\\nWhile assuring him of my delegation’s full cooperation\\nand support, I am confident that under his guidance and\\nleadership — which he has already proven in the first\\ndays of his new function — this session of the General\\nAssembly will contribute to strengthening global\\ncooperation and its indispensable platform, the United\\nNations, in the coming months.\\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\\nreiterate my very best wishes to the Secretary-General\\non his appointment to a second term of office.\\nFurthermore, I would like to congratulate him very\\nwarmly on being awarded, jointly with the United\\nNations, the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour and\\nrecognition he truly deserves for his leadership,\\ndedication and courage in the service of our\\nOrganization. This award also signals recognition of\\nand encouragement for the United Nations and all those\\nwho are committed to its mission, not least United\\nNations staff members.\\nAllow me to also express here our thanks to the\\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\\nsession, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the many efforts he\\nundertook not only in conducting day-to-day business,\\nbut also in revitalizing the United Nations, in particular\\nthe General Assembly.\\nMy colleague, the Foreign Minister of Belgium,\\nhas already addressed this Assembly on behalf of the\\nEuropean Union. Austria fully endorses his remarks.\\nTwo months have passed now since the heinous\\nterrorist attacks of 11 September. Although we are still\\nin shock at the loss of thousands of innocent lives, we\\nhave, however, also been encouraged by the resolve\\nexpressed in the collective response of the community\\nof nations, here in the General Assembly and in the\\nSecurity Council. This unanimous strong reaction gives\\nus hope that today our nations are ready to cross over a\\nthreshold, leaving behind a world of deadly divisions\\nand entering a genuine global community.\\nThere are some positive signs to that effect.\\nThese are, first, that during the past weeks, we have\\nwitnessed new astonishing political — maybe even\\ngeopolitical — alignments that, if followed through,\\nare comparable to other watershed events of historic\\nproportions. Secondly, the menace of an\\nunprecedented, devastating type of terrorism is\\ncompelling us to take a fresh look at the root causes of\\nmuch that is unacceptable in our world, according to\\nour own standards, but which we have been tolerating,\\nor at least living with, quite contrary to our declared\\nprinciples. I refer to the abject levels of poverty,\\ninequality and injustice. These factors are at the origin\\nof many conflicts around the globe. Some of them are\\nparticularly dangerous, providing breeding grounds for\\nglobal terrorism or serving as pretexts for terrorists. It\\nwould be irresponsible if we — the international\\ncommunity — did not engage in renewed efforts to find\\nsolutions to these regional conflicts, be they in the\\nMiddle East, in Afghanistan, in Kashmir, in the\\nCaucasus or in the Balkans, as well as in the area\\naround the Great Lakes, for instance, which has seen so\\nmuch human suffering.\\nThe European Union, on a continent marked by\\ncenturies of war, has developed its model of conflict\\nresolution. It is held in three words: cooperation,\\npartnership, integration. The European Union is\\nengaged in a welcome policy of extending this zone of\\npeace. We hope that the enlarged Union, planned to\\n23\\n\\nbecome a Union of 28 and later more, will be able to\\ncontribute more effectively to peace and stability in the\\nworld.\\nUnder the present circumstances, Austria’s\\npriorities outside Europe are the Middle East and\\nCentral Asia, not least because these areas have a direct\\nbearing on the fight against terrorism in its present\\nphase.\\nThe Middle East conflict has been on our agenda\\nwithout interruption since the time of the creation of\\nthe United Nations. There is no doubt that we have a\\nspecial obligation to contribute to a just and viable\\nsolution. A heightened sense of responsibility is felt\\nwhen, on the one hand, violence escalates, but when,\\non the other — as I see it — new opportunities have\\nemerged. Austria is therefore of the opinion that major\\nconcerted efforts should be undertaken so that\\nnegotiations can resume on the basis of Security\\nCouncil resolutions without delay. Only sincere\\nnegotiations and a sincere renunciation of violence can\\nbring a rapprochement of the two parties and, finally,\\npeace.\\nAfghanistan is a reminder of what happens when\\na conflict is neglected too long. Now, there is a new\\ndimension unfolding. We are forced to act. The\\nhumanitarian tragedy is obvious. In this context,\\nCentral Asia deserves increased attention, for example,\\nin view of assistance in the maintenance of stability\\nand concertation aiming at the necessary reconstruction\\nof Afghanistan.\\nI should like to say a word as to the Balkans, a\\nneighbouring region to my country. It must not be\\nneglected, although new dangers emerge elsewhere. In\\nthe western Balkans, there is progress, especially in\\nZagreb, in Belgrade, in Tirana and in Sarajevo, but\\noverall stability and economic recovery are not yet\\nassured. Extremists have not yet disarmed. We have to\\nkeep up a high profile of international commitment.\\nCombating terrorism is, of course, not a one-\\ndimensional task. It requires cooperation on many\\nfronts. I see the United Nations as playing a key role in\\nthis regard. This requires a clarification and\\ncoordination of tasks within the United Nations system\\nso as to ensure the necessary synergy. There is also a\\nrole for regional cooperation. To provide an example, a\\nso called regional security partnership has been\\nestablished between Austria and some of its\\nneighbours, candidates for European Union\\nmembership, across the boundaries that, for half a\\ncentury, divided Europe.\\nOverall, we must address long-term societal\\ndevelopment at the local, national and global levels and\\nthe capacities required to build a universally shared\\npolitical culture based on respect for human rights and\\nhuman dignity, including for the plurality of identities\\nat all levels of society.\\nLet me elaborate now on the United Nations role.\\nThe time has certainly come to significantly strengthen\\nthe United Nations capabilities and programmes in\\ncombating and preventing terrorism. The complexity of\\nthe challenge requires intersectoral and inter-\\ninstitutional cooperation. We have to enable the\\nprincipal organs of the Organization, including their\\nspecialized subsidiary organs, such as the Security\\nCouncil’s Committee on terrorism, the General\\nAssembly’s Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism, the\\nEconomic and Social Council’s Commission on Crime\\nPrevention and Criminal Justice and the appropriate\\nSecretariat units to perform the tasks that are now\\nurgently needed.\\nThe Commission on Crime Prevention and\\nCriminal Justice will hold a special meeting on\\nterrorism in the context of the Vienna Declaration on\\nCrime and Justice on 15 November 2001. Just one\\nweek prior to the terrorist attacks of 11 September,\\nplans of action for the implementation of the Vienna\\nDeclaration were adopted. They will play an important\\nrole in the system-wide response to international\\nterrorism, including a comprehensive set of\\nrecommendations for both national and international\\naction. These recommendations stress once more the\\nexisting relationship between terrorism, on the one\\nhand, and crime, including transnational organized\\ncrime and illicit drug trafficking, on the other.\\nThe United Nations Centre for International\\nCrime Prevention and its Terrorism Prevention Branch\\nhave received a focused mandate, which should serve\\nas a solid basis for enhancing the capabilities of the\\nUnited Nations in the prevention of terrorism. To this\\nend, the human and financial resources should be\\nstrengthened accordingly.\\nNeedless to say, the challenge of terrorism\\nrequires the full support of each and every\\nGovernment. Ratification of the various international\\nlegal instruments, as well as the conclusion of\\nnegotiations concerning a comprehensive international\\n24\\n\\nconvention against terrorism, are of fundamental\\nimportance. The Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\\nUnited Nations should also get immediately active in\\nproviding, where requested, concrete assistance to\\nMember States in implementing national legislation\\nrequired by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\\nas well as in national capacity-building.\\nSeveral items on our global agenda have\\nreminded us of the fundamental importance of the\\nindividual citizen and of society in economic, social,\\ncultural and institutional development. Increasingly, we\\nhave understood the strategic role of the basic\\nprinciples and values of our societies upon which the\\nfuture of mankind is based. Our rejection of terrorism\\nmust be absolute. At the same time, we need to\\nstrengthen our networks and skills in dialogue, cross-\\nidentification and solidarity.\\nWe do need a globally shared political culture\\nthat is based on respect for global diversity, which\\nfinds its only limits in the right of others to diversity.\\nWe must never allow fanaticism, violence and\\nterrorism to undermine the fabric on which peace and\\nsecurity are built. Now more than ever, we have to\\nredouble our efforts in the development of our societies\\nbased on plurality and trust among peoples and\\ncultures.\\nIn this context, the Secretary-General’s efforts to\\npromote dialogue among civilizations, an initiative of\\nPresident Khatami, can have enormous significance.\\nAustria had the pleasure of inviting the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s Group of Eminent Persons for its first\\nmeeting in Vienna and was honoured by the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s personal participation in last summer’s\\nSalzburg dialogue among civilizations. Austria’s\\ncommitment to dialogue has found its expression in a\\nseries of inter-religious encounters, especially between\\nChristianity and Islam, over the past 10 years. These\\nencounters have served to identify common values and\\nto project them into the wider communities. For us,\\nsuch dialogue has the core objective of developing\\nsocieties’ capacities in preventing hatred,\\ndisintegration and politically motivated violence\\nagainst fellow citizens.\\nAustria’s efforts have also focused on another\\nelement of societal development. Long-term strategies\\nof terrorism prevention require a globally shared\\nculture of human rights. Let me mention briefly the\\ngrowing cooperation between qualified regional\\ninstitutions for human rights education and learning in\\nAfrica, South Asia, the Far East and the Pacific,\\nEurope and Latin America. The proclamation of human\\nrights cities in all of these regions might merit specific\\nattention by the appropriate organs of the United\\nNations, including the Commission on Human\\nSettlements.\\nWe are aware that there is a direct relationship\\nbetween the internal negation of human rights, on the\\none hand, and a culture of violence that may eventually\\nproject its effects not only internally but also\\ninternationally and even globally. In view of\\naccelerated globalization and worldwide economic,\\ncultural and information relations, we may have to take\\nproactive measures to strengthen our shared basic\\nbeliefs and political values through education and\\nlearning processes. The current United Nations Decade\\nfor Human Rights Education might also offer\\nopportunities for appropriate initiatives in response to\\nthe horrifying scenario of global terrorism.\\nIn this context, we have to give greater\\nrecognition to the role of women in providing human\\nsecurity and human development in all our societies.\\nThe recognition is due in particular in crisis areas\\nwhere women have not only been the victims of most\\nof the intra-societal violence, but have also assured the\\nsurvival of the neediest.\\nA case in point is Afghanistan and Afghan\\nsociety. Eighty-five per cent of refugees and internally\\ndisplaced persons are women and children. In fact,\\nthose who are often depicted as the weakest element in\\nsociety had to bear the brunt of violence and\\nrepression. As we design our programmes for\\nreconstructing a post-terrorist Afghanistan, we must\\nconceive of programmes by which women, in\\nparticular those now in refugee camps, are enabled to\\ncontribute their share in a governance of development,\\npeace and cooperation. This is essential for a society\\nthat wishes to overcome the scars of decades of\\nconflict and war. To be concrete, I therefore suggest\\nthat education and training programmes aimed at\\nempowering women — in particular, those in refugee\\ncamps — to assume public responsibility in the\\nreconstruction of their country be immediately\\nimplemented.\\nThe media bear an increasingly important\\nresponsibility in shaping societies’ value structures and\\ncapabilities. As Austria’s Federal Chancellor Wolfgang\\n25\\n\\nSchüssel said in his statement on the United Nations\\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations at the General\\nAssembly’s 42nd meeting, Austria is taking an\\ninitiative, in the context of the partnership between the\\nEuropean Union and the Mediterranean countries, that\\nwill focus on the special role and responsibility of the\\nmedia in this partnership and in the societal\\ndevelopment towards accepting and benefiting from the\\nplurality of cultures and identities in this region.\\nIn conclusion, I should like to make a few\\ncomments on other very important developments with\\nregard to items on our global agenda. The sustainable\\nuse of the local, national, regional and global natural\\nresources with which we are endowed continues to be\\nof foremost importance. The recent study by the\\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis\\n(IIASA) on the projected dramatic reduction of\\nagricultural productivity — between 45 and 55 per cent\\nin Africa, India, southern China and Latin America —\\nover the next 50 years due to climate change reminds\\nus that the processes of long-term global change need\\nas much action as our activities in coping with crises\\nand combating criminal terrorism. The World Summit\\non Sustainable Development in Johannesburg will need\\nnot only a technical but also a political focus with an\\nappropriate resolve for our shared global development.\\nOne specific area where newly shared policies\\nand institutional support may be required, is the\\nintegration of energy policies into the global\\nsustainable development agenda. The Commission on\\nSustainable Development at its ninth session and the\\nthird United Nations Conference on the Least\\nDeveloped Countries recognized the strong connection\\nbetween energy-policy interventions and poverty\\nreduction. Energy considerations should therefore be\\nfully integrated into the implementation of the\\nMillennium Declaration. Vienna, which hosts four\\nprominent international organizations in the field of\\nglobal energy policies — the United Nations Industrial\\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the International\\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organization of\\nthe Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and\\nIIASA — could offer, with Austria’s support, a\\nframework for developing an innovative platform in\\nthis regard. I look forward to exploring this issue\\nfurther with interested partners.\\nWith many developing regions having to cope\\nwith the difficult and often precarious management of\\nmountain resources, we should take advantage of the\\nInternational Year of Mountains, 2002, for new\\ninitiatives in exchanging experience and for new\\nprogrammes of cooperation.\\nFinally, we are still working on implementing our\\nresolve to strengthen the Economic and Social Council\\nof the United Nations for accomplishing its important\\ntasks. The Economic and Social Council reform paper\\nby the Secretariat’s Department of Economic and\\nSocial Affairs contains, I think, very valuable\\ncontributions to our ongoing debate. As Austria already\\nsuggested years ago, coordination and integration of\\nthe United Nations system’s reporting in economic and\\nsocial affairs and the preparation of a comprehensive\\n“state of the world” report by the Secretary-General\\nwould not only facilitate but significantly enhance the\\nrole of the Economic and Social Council in policy\\nformulation in this field.\\nWhen coping with the dynamic processes of\\nglobal change in the economic sector, we have to put\\nthe human being back into the centre of our policies.\\nNew efforts have to be undertaken to internalize the\\nmultiple dimensions and costs of globalization. In this\\ncontext, let me especially welcome the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s initiative of a new partnership with the\\nglobal business community, inviting it to share in the\\nresponsibility for what is happening in the global\\npublic space.\\nAll the concerns I am addressing in this statement\\nhave a common focus: understanding the human being\\nas an actor, a perpetrator, a victim and a partner, in\\nother words, as the basic paradigm of global\\ndevelopment. This is why human development, human\\nrights and human security are the points from which we\\nhave to address both the current crises and our long-\\nterm development objectives.', '\\ufeffI have\\nthe honour today to speak on behalf of the European\\nUnion, which wishes, through you, Sir, to congratulate\\nthe President on his election. That election testifies to\\nthe esteem of the international community for his\\nperson and his country. I commend the speed of action\\nand efficiency that you have shown in the face of the\\ntragic events of 11 September, in adapting the agenda\\nfor the work of this Assembly.\\nI would also like to associate with this tribute the\\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan.\\nMr. Secretary-General, your re-election had already\\ndrawn attention to the unanimous appreciation of the\\nMember States for your exceptional qualities as a\\nmanager, politician and humanist. The Nobel\\nCommittee paid an even wider tribute by awarding you\\nthe Nobel Peace Prize. The United Nations itself, here\\nat your side, was also a recipient of this message of\\nhope from a world in a state of shock, appealing to the\\nUnited Nations to remain at the centre of the\\ninternational community’s action for peace and\\ndevelopment.\\nIt was the fundamental values constituting the\\nfoundation of the United Nations that were attacked in\\nso cowardly a manner right here in New York on 11\\nSeptember, when our host country, several thousands of\\nits citizens and nationals of over 60 countries were the\\n37\\n\\nvictims of a barbaric act of aggression for which no\\njustification can be accepted.\\nThat attack, by its enormity, has opened our eyes\\nto the worldwide threat that terrorism has become. It is\\nour open, democratic, tolerant and multicultural\\nsocieties that were attacked through the United States.\\nThe terrorist threat must be hunted down in each of our\\ncountries, in our various regional organizations and, at\\nthe world level, through the United Nations.\\nThe European Union has most categorically\\ncondemned the 11 September attacks, and the fight\\nagainst terrorism is now, more than ever before, one of\\nour top objectives. The Union has declared its total\\nsolidarity with the United States. It has reaffirmed its\\nunreserved support for the military action undertaken\\nin the name of legitimate self-defence, in conformity\\nwith the Charter of the United Nations and Security\\nCouncil resolution 1368 (2001).\\nOn 21 September, an Extraordinary European\\nCouncil adopted an action plan for an unprecedented\\ncampaign against terrorism. This plan contains a\\nnumber of specific measures intended to enhance\\njudicial and police cooperation, including the\\nintroduction of a European arrest warrant. It also\\nincludes measures to put an end to the financing of\\nterrorism and to improve air security. The European\\nCouncil acknowledged that the fight against terrorism\\nrequires greater participation by the Union in the\\nefforts of the international community to prevent and\\nstabilize regional conflicts. By developing the\\nCommon Foreign and Security Policy and bringing the\\nEuropean Security and Defence Policy into operation\\nas soon as possible, the Union will be at its most\\neffective.\\nAt the global level also, fresh impetus must be\\nprovided to the fight against terrorism. Naturally, the\\nUnited Nations has a central role to play in developing\\na coordinated and diversified strategy. We warmly\\nwelcome the major steps that have already been taken\\nto that end. The most remarkable of these was the\\nadoption of resolution 1373 (2001) by the Security\\nCouncil on 28 September. The European Union and its\\nmember States are already committed to rapid\\nenactment of the measures needed for its\\nimplementation. We call upon all countries to\\ncooperate actively with the follow-up system set up by\\nthe Security Council, and we reiterate our readiness to\\nprovide aid in that connection to any countries that\\nmay have technical difficulties in meeting the\\nrequirements.\\nIt is also essential that all States ratify without\\ndelay the 12 conventions on combating terrorism and\\napply all of their provisions. The International\\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\\nTerrorism is a decisive aspect of international action\\nand needs to be speedily signed and ratified.\\nLastly, the European Union welcomes the recent\\nprogress made in negotiating a comprehensive\\nconvention on international terrorism, on the basis of a\\ndraft submitted by India. The remaining difficulties\\nmust now be dealt with as soon as possible so that this\\ninstrument can be ready for signing early next year.\\nThe efforts we are making to combat terrorism\\nmust also form part of overall efforts to build a better\\nworld, a world in which human dignity is sacrosanct, in\\nwhich human rights and fundamental freedoms are\\nfully respected.\\nThe promotion and protection of human rights\\nand an attachment to the principles of democracy and\\nthe rule of law are essential components of the\\nEuropean Union’s Common Foreign and Security\\nPolicy and of its development, cooperation and\\nexternal relations. The European Union will actively\\npursue its work on consolidating human rights and\\nfundamental freedoms, with particular insistence on the\\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent nature of all\\nhuman rights. It will continue to support efforts by the\\nSecretary-General to integrate human rights into\\nUnited Nations activities at all levels and in all forums,\\nand to cooperate with all United Nations human rights\\nmachinery.\\nThe European Union welcomes the imminent\\nestablishment of the much-awaited International\\nCriminal Court. The Union sees this as being of\\nparamount importance and urges all States that have\\nnot yet done so to accede to the Rome Statute as soon\\nas possible. More than ever before, we need a universal\\nand permanent court capable of sanctioning the most\\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\\nand human rights, thereby contributing to peace and\\nsecurity in the world. It is vital that the United Nations\\ngive effective support to the establishment of the\\nCourt.\\nFollowing the tragedy of 11 September, the\\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the 10-year\\n38\\n\\nreview of the World Summit for Children had to be\\npostponed. However, until it is held, we need to keep\\nup the momentum developed in the preparatory\\ndiscussions. We must continue to integrate the specific\\ndimension of the child into our actions and strive to\\nensure that every child’s life is free from terror, the\\nhorrors of war, abuse and exploitation, hunger and\\npoverty.\\nThe European Union is resolved to continue the\\nfight against all forms of discrimination and violence\\nagainst women, and to ensure that all countries take\\nstrong measures to apply the Convention on the\\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\\nWomen. Women must be able to enjoy their human\\nrights in full, on an equal footing with men. Girls must\\nhave the same opportunities as boys, particularly in\\neducation and access to social services. The European\\nUnion insists also that there be equal rights to property,\\ncredit facilities and social services, including\\nreproductive health services. It is in the interest of\\neveryone that women be able to participate fully in\\neconomic and political life at all levels.\\nThe Union stresses the importance of\\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)\\nand the special attention that must be given to the\\nparticipation and full association of women on an equal\\nfooting in all efforts aimed at maintaining and\\npromoting peace and security.\\nWe must also vigorously pursue the crucial fight\\nagainst racist and discriminatory tendencies and\\nintolerance, which are daily realities throughout the\\nworld. The World Conference against Racism, Racial\\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\\nhas, I believe, shown us the way forward. It has also\\nenabled us to advance our ways of thinking about the\\ncauses and origins of racism and, above all, to view our\\npast in a new way. What matters now is that we find\\nthe will to close the darkest chapters of our history so\\nthat we can build a new relationship based on mutual\\nrespect, solidarity and partnership.\\nThe terrible humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is\\ngripping the attention of the international community\\njust as much as the political, diplomatic, military and\\neconomic aspects of the situation in that country. This\\nis the first time that the international community has\\nadopted such a global approach to an armed conflict.\\nWe are convinced that this is the best — if not the\\nonly — way to ensure effective resolution of the crisis.\\nThe coordination of aid efforts, primarily on the ground\\nand as part of the range of actions undertaken by the\\nUnited Nations, remains essential.\\nEmergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan is an\\nabsolute priority for the European Union, which has\\nundertaken to mobilize an aid package of over 320\\nmillion euros as soon as possible. The Union expresses\\nits concern about the difficulties of access, as well as of\\ndelivering humanitarian assistance, in Afghanistan. It\\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations specialized\\nagencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross\\nand all humanitarian organizations in seeking practical\\nand flexible solutions. It also calls on the countries of\\nthe region to facilitate, by all possible means,\\nhumanitarian operations to deal with new influxes of\\nAfghan refugees.\\nThe European Union recognizes the vital role of\\nthe United Nations in the search for a peace plan for\\nAfghanistan. It intends to support the initiatives of the\\nSecretary-General and his Special Representative and\\nto make a constructive contribution, with regard to\\nboth the search for an internal political solution and to\\na plan for rebuilding the country. The Union also\\nstresses the importance of the regional dimension of\\nthe stabilization of Afghanistan.\\nWe must make adequate contributions to the\\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs so\\nas to ensure that it can function efficiently. The\\nEuropean Union attaches particular importance to aid\\nto persons displaced within their countries. We\\ntherefore welcome the fact that a unit has been\\nestablished within the Secretariat to cater to their\\nspecific needs. Following the recent attacks against\\nhumanitarian aid personnel, the European Union can\\nonly call once again for the strengthening of\\narrangements, particularly those of a legal and financial\\nnature, for guaranteeing the safety and security of\\nhumanitarian aid workers and United Nations workers\\nin general.\\nNow more than ever, disarmament and non-\\nproliferation constitute the cornerstone of any peace\\nand security structure, and must therefore be subject to\\nbinding multilateral norms. It is against that\\nbackground that we wish to strengthen the non-\\nproliferation regime, promote the rapid entry into force\\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and\\nreinforce the biological and toxin weapons Convention.\\nWe must also combat the proliferation of ballistic\\n39\\n\\nmissiles and the illicit trade in light weapons and\\ncontinue to work for the complete elimination of anti-\\npersonnel mines.\\nWith regard to peacekeeping, the United Nations\\nhas shown in the past year that it is better equipped and\\nbetter organized than it has been in recent times. By\\nway of example, I should like to mention the\\noperations in East Timor, Eritrea and Sierra Leone.\\nProgress has thus already been made on the ground in\\nimplementing the recommendations of the Brahimi\\nreport. But much remains to be done, and the European\\nUnion will continue to provide its active support for\\nimproving the capabilities of the Department of\\nPeacekeeping Operations and advocating that the\\nOrganization be given the resources that it needs to\\nenable it effectively to discharge its increasingly\\ncomplex responsibilities.\\nA comprehensive and long-term approach is\\nrequired in order to resolve differences of opinion,\\nconsolidate peace and prevent a resurgence of conflict.\\nThe European Union, which is currently establishing\\nits own military and civil crisis-management capability,\\nis actively engaged in strengthening its cooperation\\nwith the United Nations and other international\\norganizations in the area of conflict prevention, crisis\\nmanagement, humanitarian aid, post-conflict\\nreconstruction and long-term development.\\nThe Balkans, a region so close to the countries of\\nthe European Union, remains at the centre of the\\nUnion’s external activities. We resolutely maintain our\\ncommitment to contribute to building a region of\\nsecurity, prosperity and democracy there, where multi-\\nethnic societies can be free to flourish. Progress has\\nbeen remarkable and encouraging, but unfortunately in\\nmany cases the situation remains fragile. The\\ninternational community must remain vigilant and must\\nnot let extremists, of whatever kind, use violence to\\ndestroy the stabilization work already carried out.\\nThe situation in the Middle East is worsening.\\nThe lack of any political perspective naturally\\nencourages continued confrontation and plays into the\\nhands of extremists. Defiance, fear and resentment\\nradicalize people’s mindsets. The European Union calls\\non Israelis and Palestinians, while there is still time,\\nimmediately to resume the peace process, without\\npreconditions, on the basis of the Mitchell report. It\\ncalls on the Israeli authorities to immediately withdraw\\ntheir forces from Palestinian-administered areas. It\\ncalls on the Palestinian Authority to do its utmost to\\narrest those responsible for violence against Israel.\\nIt is necessary to preserve what has been achieved\\nso far in the peace process: the principles of the Madrid\\nConference, in particular the principle of land for\\npeace, as well as Security Council resolutions 242\\n(1967) and 338 (1973) and the agreements signed by\\nthe parties, which have already led to real results on the\\nground and to progress on the basis of earlier\\nnegotiations. The European Union calls on both parties\\nto do their utmost in the political, security, economic\\nand social areas in order to get back to the negotiating\\ntable, without preconditions, with the objective of\\nrealizing the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the\\nregion, as set out at the Madrid Conference of 1991.\\nFor the Palestinians, the establishment of a viable\\ndemocratic State and an end to the occupation of their\\nterritory is essential. The Israelis must have the right to\\nlive in peace and security within internationally\\nrecognized borders. The European Union also recalls\\nthat the search for a comprehensive and lasting peace\\nin the region requires due account to be taken of the\\nIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of the\\nconflict. The same principles should apply in the\\nresolution of those situations.\\nIt is primarily for the parties themselves to try to\\nfind peace through negotiating all elements relating to\\npermanent status. This will include finding a viable and\\njust solution to the particularly complex issues of\\nJerusalem and the refugees, as well as those of the\\neconomic support for the Palestinian people.\\nThe European Union, in close cooperation with\\nthe United States of America and the other partners\\ninvolved, reaffirms its willingness to work for a final\\nsettlement to the conflict. We believe that it is now a\\nmatter of urgency to develop an initiative to strongly\\nurge the parties to resume their political dialogue.\\nThe European Union finds the status quo in\\nCyprus unacceptable. We express our disappointment\\nat the unjustified decision of the Turkish side to decline\\nthe Secretary-General’s invitation to pursue talks. We\\ncontinue to support the Secretary-General’s endeavours\\ntowards a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the\\nCyprus question in accordance with the relevant\\nSecurity Council resolutions.\\nThe scale of the tragedies on the African\\ncontinent demands resolute action on our part, at all\\nlevels, to address the direct structural causes of those\\n40\\n\\nconflicts. Conflicts in Africa have become increasingly\\ncomplex and their cross-border effects increasingly\\ndestructive. The crises in the Great Lakes region of\\nWest Africa, in Zimbabwe and in the Horn of Africa\\nrequire increased vigilance on the part of the\\nOrganization. Those crises also show the need for a\\ncomprehensive and integrated international approach.\\nWe gave an enthusiastic welcome to the launch of the\\nNew African Initiative at the Lusaka summit of the\\nOrganization of African Unity. The European Union\\nhas stated its willingness to respond and has already\\nentered into a dialogue at the highest level with the\\nAfrican Union.\\nAt the Millennium Summit, we pledged together\\nto attain a set of development objectives. That is an\\nambitious project which involves, inter alia, good\\ngovernance in each country and at the international\\nlevel. The Union underlines the need for strengthened\\npartnership between rich countries and poor countries\\nto achieve the development objectives of the\\nMillennium Declaration. That partnership entails\\nobligations and joint but varied efforts on the part of all\\ncountries.\\nFirst of all, we must make every effort to\\neradicate poverty. New, concrete commitments were\\nmade at the third United Nations Conference on Least\\nDeveloped Countries, held at Brussels last May. The\\nEuropean Union committed itself to untying aid, to\\nopening up its markets through the “everything but\\narms” initiative and to the full financing of the Heavily\\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. It is\\nnow a question of finalizing the follow-up mechanisms\\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed\\nCountries. The European Union will also continue to\\ngive priority to the development of Africa.\\nTwo major international conferences will give us\\nan opportunity to take up the challenges and achieve\\nthe principal objectives of the Millennium Declaration.\\nAt the International Conference on Financing for\\nDevelopment, to be held next March at Monterrey,\\nMexico, we shall focus on improving cooperation\\namong all development actors, and on using resources\\nmore effectively and better mobilizing them.\\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable\\nDevelopment, to be held at Johannesburg in October\\n2002, we wish to promote the sustainable use and\\nmanagement and the protection of the natural resources\\nthat are the underpinning of economic and social\\ndevelopment. We wish also to integrate action on the\\nenvironment and poverty, to ensure that globalization\\nserves the needs of sustainable development, and to\\npromote better ways of managing public affairs and\\nparticipation. The European Union would like to\\nexplore with its partners the possibility of achieving at\\nthe Summit a global pact on sustainable development.\\nSuch a pact should contain commitments both from\\nGovernments and from other actors. A global pact\\nshould lead to concrete action to improve the\\nimplementation of sustainable development policies.\\nWe hope that United Nations Member States will\\nwithout delay commit themselves to be represented at\\nMonterrey and at Johannesburg at the highest possible\\npolitical level.\\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on\\nClimate Change was one of the major results of the\\n1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and\\nDevelopment. We welcome the progress made at Bonn\\nand at Marrakesh, and we undertake speedily to ratify\\nthe Kyoto Protocol.\\nWe have also just reached an intergovernmental\\nconsensus at the highest level on the strategy needed to\\nhalt the appalling global AIDS pandemic. That was a\\nmajor step forward, but the urgent and tragic nature of\\nthe problem demand greater ambition. We will actively\\ncontribute to the creation of the new Global Fund to\\ncombat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and we\\nwill play an active role in all the other processes that\\nemerged from last June’s special session so that the\\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS is put into\\npractice through concrete measures.\\nAmong other challenges, the demographic\\nchanges that lie ahead are of particular interest to the\\nEuropean Union. The second World Assembly on\\nAgeing, to be held at Madrid in April 2002, will be an\\nopportunity for us to work together to build a society\\nfor all ages.\\nThe Millennium Summit enabled us to tackle, at\\nthe highest level, the major challenges facing the world\\ncommunity. We must now turn our attention to the\\nprocess of following up the Declaration adopted by\\nheads of State or Government with all due regard for\\nthe lofty and balanced aims of that cardinal text. For\\nthat, we need reliable data and depend on the existing\\nfollow-up machinery and processes and on the\\nconcerted efforts of the various actors in the\\n41\\n\\ninternational community who can help us to achieve\\nthose objectives.\\nWe must also continue reform of the United\\nNations system as a whole, including the specialized\\nagencies and the operational funds and programmes.\\nThe strengthening of the Security Council and its\\ncomprehensive reform in all its aspects should be\\npursued with determination. If we want a Security\\nCouncil capable of responding even more effectively to\\nthe major challenges of the moment, we must intensify\\nour efforts.\\nLooking beyond the tremendous and growing\\ncomplexity of our actions at the international level, our\\ndebate should highlight this basic truth: if we want to\\nbuild a world made more peaceful by respect for the\\nlaw, solidarity and tolerance, we must strengthen our\\ncohesiveness in the face of the new challenges before\\nus, and also step up our efforts to promote human\\nrights, eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable\\ndevelopment.\\nIn this forum of the United Nations, we reply to\\nthe messengers of destruction with our common ideal,\\nwhich will be stronger than hatred and division among\\nmankind. That edifice, whose foundations are set in our\\nspirits and in our hearts, will be unassailable.\\n', '\\ufeffAt the\\noutset, it is a great pleasure for me to congratulate the\\nPresident on his election, which is a sign of the esteem\\nin which he and his country are held.\\nComing after his re-election to a second term ─\\nwhich is a sign of the general confidence he has\\nearned ─ the Nobel Peace Prize that has been awarded\\nto the Secretary-General is a well-deserved tribute to\\nhis work and, through him, to the United Nations\\nOrganization as a whole, thereby inspiring greater hope\\nthan ever before.\\nOn this my third visit to New York since the\\ntragedy of 11 September, I also want to express once\\nagain my profound emotion and pay homage to the\\npeople of New York, who are being so severely tested,\\nand to their courageous mayor, who is now finishing\\nhis term.\\nThe unprecedented magnitude and gravity of the\\nterrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11\\nSeptember warrant our unfailing solidarity and an\\nexceptional response. In its resolution 1368 (2001),\\nwhich was adopted unanimously, the Security Council\\nrightly qualified those acts as attacks and, hence, as\\nlegitimately meriting a defensive response under\\nArticle 51 of the Charter. The United States is thus\\nentirely within its legal and political rights in carrying\\nout its targeted military response against the terrorist\\norganizations responsible for those acts. The military\\naction under way was therefore inevitable, and must be\\npursued until all its objectives have been achieved.\\nGiven the preliminary results achieved yesterday, I\\nhope that those objectives will be met as soon as\\npossible. The leaders of these terrorist networks and\\nthose who support them must be decisively prevented\\nfrom committing further harm.\\nBut that military action should, as a matter of\\ncourse, form part of an overarching strategy that\\nincludes immediate, broad-scale humanitarian action\\nthat is better adapted to the needs of people in distress.\\nFrance has put forward several proposals in this regard\\nand supports the current initiatives for better\\ncoordination. That overarching strategy should also\\ninclude a political solution — something that has now\\nbecome urgent — and strive to ensure that the demise\\nof the Taliban regime does not lead to factional\\ninfighting and chaos; and it must once again make the\\nAfghan people masters of their own future. That is the\\naim of the action plan for Afghanistan that France\\nproposed back on 1 October, and of the other\\ncontributions it has made with the same goals in mind.\\nWe await Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi’s proposals with\\ninterest; they should set forth broad outlines of action\\nfor the United Nations. On these bases, the Security\\nCouncil should be able to adopt a framework resolution\\nwithin a few days, endorsing Mr. Brahimi’s proposals\\nand spelling out the modalities of United Nations\\nsupport for the establishment of an Afghan\\n26\\n\\nGovernment representative of the various constituents\\nof the population. There is no question of imposing on\\nAfghanistan some ready-made solution concocted by\\noutsiders. I call on all the constituents of the Afghan\\nnation and all neighbouring countries to heed the\\ngeneral interest of Afghanistan and its people. This is\\ncompatible with respect for the legitimate interests of\\nthe various parties concerned and it is the only way to\\nturn our backs on the past.\\nBeyond immediate military, diplomatic and\\nhumanitarian action, our common fight against\\nterrorism needs to be pursued in all its forms, including\\npolice, judicial and others. The United Nations will\\nhave a crucial role to play in this difficult struggle,\\nlaying down universal obligations for each State and\\nthe framework for our action. A series of conventions\\nhas already been concluded, particularly the\\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\\nFinancing of Terrorism, which I proposed in this very\\nplace in 1999. We must speed up the signature and\\nratification of those conventions. The General\\nAssembly must quickly conclude the negotiations on\\nthe comprehensive convention on international\\nterrorism. For its part, the Security Council should\\noversee the coordinated implementation by States of its\\nresolution 1373 (2001).\\nAction against terrorism also needs to be carried\\nout through other organizations, in conjunction with\\nthe United Nations and consistent with its policies. For\\nits part, the European Union (EU) has just taken\\nunprecedented steps to strengthen police and judicial\\ncooperation among its member States, including the\\ncreation of a European arrest warrant. An ambitious\\naction plan has been agreed. The 29 members of the\\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) have decided to\\nextend the fight against money-laundering to the fight\\nagainst the financing of terrorism. Beyond that, I\\npropose the creation of a dialogue forum to move us in\\nthis direction. Several other organizations, too, will\\nhave a role to play, so that at the end of the day every\\ncountry will be making a contribution.\\nLeaving aside the hoped-for short-term results,\\nthe obstacles notwithstanding, we will not achieve\\nlasting victory against all forms of terrorism unless we\\nsucceed in depriving terrorists of their breeding ground\\nand eliminating the pretexts from which they\\nfallaciously draw their justification, and unless we\\neradicate them in the true sense of the term. That\\nimplies nothing short of changing our world. And let\\nno one claim that this would be tantamount to\\njustifying the terrorists. For neither my country, nor\\nEurope, nor the United Nations — in other words, none\\nof us — waited for 11 September to discover, condemn\\nand seek to remedy the ills of the world. Yet how many\\ngood intentions have come to naught? How many\\nresolutions have gone unimplemented? How many\\nannouncements have failed to materialize, which now\\nfeed a sense of bitterness and incomprehension? It is\\npointless to condemn or deny the theory of a clash of\\ncivilizations. Rather, we must fight against such a risk,\\nwhich is by no means wholly imaginary, and against\\nthose who would make it a reality.\\nThis should be one more pressing reason for us\\nall to find a solution to regional crises, particularly in\\nthe Middle East. Since 1982, France has called for the\\ncreation of a Palestinian State. Naturally, it would have\\nto be viable, democratic and peaceful, and it should\\ngive credible undertakings as regards Israel’s security.\\nGuarantees will be needed, yet the Palestinian State is\\nnot the problem; it is the solution for reasons based on\\nrights, humanity and security. Such is the EU’s\\ncommon stance today. This morning, before the\\nAssembly, President Bush himself has made this his\\nobjective. It is the path of reason — the only path that\\ncan halt the murderous spiral of conflict between the\\ntwo peoples.\\nAdmittedly, responsibility for a lasting peace\\nagreement lies first and foremost with the protagonists.\\nUnless they make the move, no one else will be able to\\novercome their fears and resentment and put an end to\\nthe suffering of these two peoples. Yet, the increasing\\nthreat that this conflict poses to international peace and\\nsecurity requires that those who have the will and the\\nmeans join forces in a push for peace, given that the\\nmain players are evidently unable to do so unaided.\\nThe urgency of the situation in the Near East\\nobviously should not make us forget Iraq. Regional\\nsecurity still needs to be secured by restoring an\\ninternational monitoring capability and by alleviating\\nthe suffering of the Iraqi people through the lifting of\\nthe embargo on civilian goods. I hope the discussions\\nnow in progress in the Security Council will finally\\nbring this about.\\nNor should we forget the Caucasus, where ancient\\nquarrels live on and where new ones are rising to the\\nfore. Yet, here again there is no other way than to seek\\nnegotiated political solutions.\\n27\\n\\nIn the Balkans, we realized that international\\ninvolvement must be sustainable. Thanks to it, and\\nthanks to new leaders, noteworthy progress has been\\nachieved towards democracy, reconciliation and\\nregional cooperation over the last two years. We must\\nmake sure these positive changes are not challenged by\\noutmoded patterns of behaviour. We must maintain and\\npursue the Europeanization of the Balkans.\\nTurning to the Great Lakes region, we know that\\nthe lasting resolution of the conflict, which involves\\nmore than eight countries, will be a negotiated solution\\nthat will ensure the restoration of the sovereignty of the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and include as well\\nsafeguard clauses to protect the security of each of the\\nStates. The Lusaka Agreement and the relevant\\nSecurity Council resolutions provide the framework for\\nending this crisis, but they should be applied as quickly\\nas possible. To halt the illegal use of the resources of\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which often\\noccurs in association with forced child labour, should\\nbe an immediate priority.\\nIn all the cases I have just referred to briefly —\\nand there are others — the problem we have to resolve\\nis the coexistence of peoples who are at once close and\\nantagonistic, deeply affected and divided by history\\nand separated by fear and the spirit of revenge. We will\\nachieve this only through perseverance and a clear\\nunderstanding of each particular situation, guided by\\nthe principles of the United Nations.\\nEven if we managed to resolve all these regional\\ncrises and others as well, our task would still not be\\nover because, at the global level, the gulf between\\nintentions for the world as stated at international\\nmeetings and actual realities is becoming intolerable\\nfor many peoples. We must redouble our efforts to\\ncreate humane globalization. We saw this in Seattle, we\\nsaw it in Genoa, and even more so in Durban. We can\\nsee it in the reactions to the Afghan crisis and to many\\nother issues. Despite the United Nations and our good\\nresolutions, there is still no real universal consensus.\\nWhat we call “the international community” has yet to\\nbe built. Is this a reason to throw in the towel? To the\\ncontrary – absolutely not. France has long been\\ndetermined to add its stone to this edifice. We have\\nalready put forward numerous proposals to that end and\\nwill continue to do so, with increased conviction.\\nNeed I recall our well-known major objectives for\\nthe world?\\nFirst, we must achieve a fairer distribution of\\nwealth; 3 billion people currently live on less than 2\\ndollars per day, and the global income gap between the\\nrichest and the poorest has doubled over the last 40\\nyears.\\nSecond, we must end impunity.\\nThird, we must guarantee sustainable\\ndevelopment everywhere — “sustainable”, that little\\nword that makes all the difference, or which should\\nmake all the difference. The World Summit in\\nJohannesburg in September 2002 will provide an\\nopportunity to affirm a vision and a benchmark of\\ndevelopment based on three intimately linked pillars:\\neconomic, social and environmental.\\nFourth, we must help refugees and fully respect\\nthe right of asylum.\\nFifth, we must manage population movements in\\na humanitarian manner.\\nSixth, we must draft international standards in a\\ndemocratic way to ensure that they are entirely\\nlegitimate and that everyone will consequently be\\nbound to comply with them.\\nSeventh, we must no longer tolerate situations of\\nhuman distress. State sovereignty, which remains an\\nessential feature of the international system, cannot, in\\nextreme emergencies, be regarded as an absolute\\nprinciple serving as a pretext for inaction. The Security\\nCouncil must be able to fully assume its\\nresponsibilities in cases of gross human rights\\nviolations, for these also pose threats to international\\npeace and security.\\nEighth, we must aim at promoting balanced and\\nnegotiated disarmament, which strengthens security\\nand strategic stability.\\nNinth, we must strive to allow all languages,\\ncultures and civilizations to exist while maintaining a\\ndialogue with one another.\\nTenth, we must seek to improve the state of\\nhealth worldwide, which for one thing means devoting\\nmore resources to combating HIV/AIDS. I would hope\\nthat the new Global AIDS and Health Fund will be\\nmade operational by the beginning of 2002.\\nBut we are undoubtedly now more aware than in\\nrecent years that the attainment of these objectives,\\nwhich are both indispensable, and very ambitious, calls\\n28\\n\\ndifferent rules and different mechanisms, starting with\\nthe reform and enlargement of the Security Council,\\nwhich we have waited for all too long; with respect for\\nthe role of the General Assembly; with the ratification\\nof the major multilateral instruments — I am thinking\\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court and\\nthe Kyoto Protocol, among others; with a more\\nappropriate and less indiscriminate use of sanctions\\nwhen they are needed; with a clarification of the\\nrespective and legitimate roles of Governments and\\ncivil society; with an agreement on the modalities of\\ninterference to deal with large-scale and extreme\\nemergency situations; with a regulation and\\ndevelopment round at the World Trade Organization\\n(WTO), which is starting today in Doha; with closer\\ncooperation and greater consistency between the WTO\\nand the International Labour Organization; with the\\ncreation of a world environmental organization; and\\nwith reform of the international financial institutions. I\\nshall stop this list here. I could go on, for there is so\\nmuch that remains to be done.\\nAll of us, as Members of the United Nations, are\\nfaced with this challenge. But I do not hesitate to say\\nhere that the rich countries — in other words, the West\\nand a handful of other countries from the Organization\\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, where\\nsome 1.135 billion men and women live, have even\\nmore responsibility than others. Now that the illusions\\nof the last 10 years have been dispelled, the choice\\nbefore us is harsh, but clear: either a world so unjust\\nthat we have conflict with no foreseeable end, or, on\\nthe contrary, an international community of the United\\nNations, at last worthy of the name, to solve together\\nhumanity’s common problems and ensure its future.\\nBut building this community, instead of just talking\\nabout it or yearning for it, will mean for some of us\\ngiving up privileges, sharing wealth and power in new\\nways, and rewriting certain rules hitherto held to be\\ninviolable. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist\\nJoseph Stiglitz has written, free trade was designed by\\nWestern countries for the Western countries. This is\\ndebatable, of course, but none of this will happen\\nwithout sacrifices, above all on the part of the rich and\\npowerful countries.\\nAt this very moment, a reshuffling of diplomatic\\ncards on a grand scale is under way between the United\\nStates, Russia, China, Europe, the Arab or Muslim\\nworld, the other coalition partners, the rest of the world\\nand the United Nations. I hope — I truly hope — that\\nthis will help to bring about a vital awakening and that\\nmy country, Europe and the United Nations will follow\\nnew avenues, in deeds and not just words, and that all\\nof us, together, will successfully extend the needed\\ncoalition against terrorism to turn it into a coalition for\\nan equitable world, and that this will lay the\\ngroundwork for a renewal of the international system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\ufeffFirst, I should like to express our very sincere\\ncondolences and sense of compassion to the families of\\nthe victims of the tragic accident that occurred this\\nmorning, as well as to the authorities of the City and\\nState of New York, which have been so seriously\\naffected by the terrorist attacks on 11 September.\\nI should, however, like to congratulate our\\nPresident, Mr. Han Seung-soo. I am convinced that\\nwith the cooperation of Member States, he will be able\\nto conduct this Assembly in a way to ensure that it\\nresponds ambitiously and effectively to the challenges\\nbefore it.\\nPresident Holkeri conducted the Millennium\\nAssembly deftly, wisely exercising his presidential\\nauthority and evincing a soothing sense of humour. We\\nwould like to thank him for that.\\nOur Secretary-General tirelessly continues his\\nwork to promote international peace and security.\\nMember States wish to thank him for the imagination\\nand wisdom shown as he discharges his lofty\\nresponsibility, and they have renewed his term of\\noffice. International public opinion has expressed its\\ngratitude for his exceptional commitment by giving\\nhim, together with the United Nations, the Nobel Peace\\nPrize. We would like to associate ourselves with that\\ntribute. We congratulate him and wish him the best in\\nhis difficult work at the head of the Organization.\\nIn the course of this first session of the twenty-\\nfirst century, the General Assembly has begun its work\\nunder the sign of terrorism. The indescribable crime\\nthat was committed on 11 September 2001 against the\\nUnited States of America and its citizens, male and\\nfemale, represents a breakdown in international\\nrelations. It was not only America that was targeted by\\nthis infamous attack against the World Trade Center\\ntowers  it was our lifestyle in an open, democratic,\\ntolerant and multicultural society to which the broad\\nmajority of countries and peoples represented here\\naspire. That is unbearable to terrorists.\\n17\\n\\nCivilian airplanes have become guided missiles\\nthrough blind and murderous terrorism, and as a result\\nwe all feel attacked. We can't call this a confrontation\\nhere between civilizations, combat between North and\\nSouth, between religions. The perpetrators of the\\nrepugnant attack of 11 September wish to deny by their\\nact the very values that form the basis of the\\ninternational community, which we have endeavoured\\nto build for the past 50 years through the United\\nNations and its multilateral system.\\nThe subsequent discussion in public opinion has\\nshown that our societies do not yet know each other\\nwell enough. Ignorance leads to distrust and even\\nhostility, promoting a chilling self-absorption.\\nDialogue among civilizations, as promoted and\\npractised by our Organization, must now more than\\never be at the forefront of our considerations.\\nHaving expressed its compassion for the innocent\\nvictims of those cowardly attacks, the international\\ncommunity must now react with determination to\\nensure that the perpetrators receive the punishment\\nthey deserve and to defend itself in such a way as to\\nprevent such acts in the future. I should like to take this\\nopportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the United\\nStates of America in its exercise of its legitimate right\\nto self-defence.\\nTwo days ago, the current President of the\\nEuropean Union, Mr. Louis Michel, gave a detailed\\ndescription of the measures and initiatives taken by the\\n15 member States to combat the scourge of terrorism.\\nLuxembourg is participating unreservedly in this joint\\neffort.\\nOnly through coordinated and interdisciplinary\\nwork will we be able to fight all forms of terrorism.\\nOur response must be commensurate with the threat,\\nwhile respecting the fundamental freedoms of the\\ncitizen  a principle that underlies our civilization.\\nWith regard to the situation in Afghanistan, we\\nmust work under the auspices of the United Nations\\nwith a view to promoting the emergence of a stable and\\nlegitimate Government that is representative of the\\nAfghan population as a whole. Such a Government\\nmust respect the human rights of the Afghan people\\nand develop good-neighbourly relations with all the\\ncountries of the region. In that context, I should like to\\nwelcome in particular the activities of the Special\\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for\\nAfghanistan, Mr. Brahimi.\\nAs soon as its objective has been achieved, the\\ninternational community, through the concerted efforts\\nof the United Nations, the International Committee of\\nthe Red Cross and other international organizations,\\nshould set up an ambitious programme that is both\\npolitical and humanitarian, with a view to helping to\\nreconstruct Afghanistan and to ensure its integration\\nwithin a stabilized region. Such an effort will require\\nintensified political dialogue with all of the countries\\nof the region.\\nAt this time, the provision of assistance to the\\ncivilian population in Afghanistan and to the refugees\\nacross its borders is a matter of priority. My country\\nhas already raised almost 7 million euros for that\\npurpose as part of a comprehensive effort within the\\nEuropean Union amounting to more than 320 million\\neuros.\\nAlthough there are no grounds for making a\\ndirect connection between the events of 11 September\\nand the situation in the Middle East, the situation there\\nis becoming increasingly worrying. We note that,\\nunfortunately, the fabric that was woven during 10\\nyears of mediation efforts and that was almost\\ncompleted at Taba is now unravelling before our eyes.\\nDuring my recent visit to the region, I noted the extent\\nto which the peace process, which has been deadlocked\\nfor far too long, is suffering from the absence of any\\nreal prospects and from increasing distrust among the\\nparties.\\nThat is why, together with our colleagues from\\nthe European Union, we are stepping up our efforts to\\nconvince the parties that only the cessation of violence\\nand the recognition of two States will make it possible\\nfor negotiations to resume that can lead to a just and\\nlasting peace in the region, on the basis of the\\nestablishment of a Palestinian State and the right of\\nIsrael to live in peace and security. The European\\nUnion stands ready to provide a framework for this\\nprocess, in cooperation with the United States of\\nAmerica and the Arab States of the region, and to assist\\nthe parties with a view to facilitating the reconciliation\\nthat is necessary.\\nIn the meantime, the United Nations will\\ntirelessly pursue its efforts to achieve international\\npeace and stability. In 2001, four reports of the\\nSecretary-General  dealing with peacekeeping,\\nhumanitarian action, the prevention of conflict and the\\nfollow-up to the Millennium Summit  have shown\\n18\\n\\nthe way forward. They show that it is necessary for the\\ninternational community to be steadfast in its\\ncommitment to the prevention and management of\\nconflict.\\nAny hesitation or fleeting expression of\\ndisinterest might risk encouraging elements that may\\nwant to aggressively defend their own interests without\\nregard for the consequences at the national or\\ninternational level. Europe has witnessed such dramatic\\nchains of events, particularly in the Balkans, and we\\ncan only feel a sense of humility when considering\\ntheir disastrous effects.\\nIf this year the United Nations has not been on\\nthe front line in the Balkans, it has been working hard\\nin the area of peacekeeping. I would like to make two\\ncomments about these operations. First, we note that\\nthere has been a considerable improvement in the\\nquality of their management, following the conclusions\\nof the Brahimi report. Secondly, there has been an\\ninternational commitment to deal with hotbeds of\\ntension as diverse and complex as those of Kosovo,\\nEast Timor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\\nSierra Leone.\\nThe balance sheet is relatively encouraging.\\nKosovo will soon be holding elections that will have\\nimportant consequences for the future of the province.\\nThe United Nations operation in East Timor can,\\nperhaps, be viewed as a clear success for international\\naction. Attempts to restructure peacekeeping operations\\nhave been promoted through careful consideration in\\nthe Secretariat, the Security Council and the General\\nAssembly, based upon an outstanding follow-up report.\\nThe complexity of crisis situations often, of\\ncourse, demands a prudent response, even when real\\nprogress has been made, as is the case in Sierra Leone.\\nIt is even more important to document international\\ndetermination through clear mandates that allow for a\\nstrong response. We believe that the inclusion of troop-\\ncontributing countries in the decision-making process\\nis essential. The increasingly integrated approach that\\nhas been chosen, as illustrated by the United Nations\\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the\\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East\\nTimor, is designed to ensure a logical succession\\nbetween the phases of prevention, peacekeeping and,\\nfinally, consolidation, reconstruction and development.\\nOne of the most urgent tasks of our Organization\\nis to provide immediate assistance for civilian\\npopulations that are the victims of natural disasters or\\ncrises brought about by human intervention.\\nLuxembourg attaches particular importance to such\\nneeds, and we are endeavouring to support United\\nNations offices in this physically and morally\\ndemanding task. Since the fall of 2000, we have been\\ncoordinating, on an informal basis, the donor countries\\nin New York, and our delegation takes pleasure in\\nnoting the dedication of the competent officials and\\nauthorities who head these services. I would like to\\nassure the Assembly that my country is clearly aware\\nof the need to protect, and ensure the safety of,\\npersonnel.\\nHumanitarian action, prevention, ceasefire\\nagreements and peace-building activities hardly\\nconstitute the entire agenda of the international\\ncommunity. A functioning democracy is a major asset\\nin progress towards development, as I have already\\nemphasized. I need only reaffirm the importance of\\nnational efforts to combat corruption and foster the\\nestablishment, within our societies, of the rule of law\\nbased on an equitable and properly functioning legal\\nsystem.\\nMy country welcomes the efforts under way\\nwithin the United Nations to put an end to impunity\\nand to ensure that those responsible for committing\\ncrimes against humanity and other atrocities answer for\\ntheir actions within an international criminal\\njurisdiction.\\nA special tribunal to judge crimes committed\\nduring the course of the civil war is in the process of\\nbeing established in Sierra Leone, and Luxembourg has\\nmade a financial contribution to its establishment. In\\nCambodia, a law to establish a tribunal to consider the\\natrocities and genocide perpetrated under the\\ndictatorship of the Khmer Rouge is now in force, and\\nwe must assess its compatibility with the memorandum\\nproposed by the United Nations. The Tribunals in The\\nHague and Arusha have stepped up their work, and, for\\nthe first time, a former head of State is awaiting his\\ntrial in prison. We welcome these developments, as\\nwell as those who have joined us in the group of\\ncountries that have ratified the Rome Statute of the\\nfuture International Criminal Court. The citizens of\\nLuxembourg would be pleased to see that convention\\nenter into force as soon as possible and acceded to by a\\nbroad majority of States.\\n19\\n\\nIn September 2000, heads of State and\\nGovernment met here in New York. Since then, the\\nMillennium Declaration has underpinned the actions of\\nthe United Nations and of States at the national level.\\nTogether with its European partners, Luxembourg has\\naffirmed its dedication to the commitments entered into\\nthere.\\nI conclude by citing two facts that illustrate the\\nawareness of my country's Government of the\\nresponsibilities its shares with all here in preparing for\\nthe future of coming generations. First, official\\ndevelopment assistance from Luxembourg has reached\\n0.71 per cent of our gross national product; the\\nGovernment has decided to raise it to 1 per cent by\\n2005. I have also submitted to my country's Chamber\\nof Deputies Luxembourg's first nomination to serve as\\na non-permanent member of the Security Council.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffFirst of all, I\\nshould like to wish you every success, Mr. President, in\\nyour responsible office. We are delighted that you, a\\nrepresentative of our Czech neighbours, will preside\\nover the General Assembly this year. I also express my\\nsincere thanks to the outgoing President.\\nI endorse the statement of the Danish presidency\\nof the European Union.\\nOne year ago, the world was shaken by the terror\\nof 11 September, which was disdainful of human life.\\nCivilian aircraft were transformed into guided missiles\\nwhose deployment had been planned without any\\nregard for human life. The devastating consequences\\ndestroyed families, shattered hopes and tore people\\napart, regardless of their age, gender or religious\\naffiliation. Three days ago, we remembered the victims\\nin a moving ceremony here in New York. We have not\\nforgotten the images of 11 September; we have not\\nrecovered from the shock. Our solidarity with the\\nUnited States is unbroken. We understand our\\nAmerican friends. Just like them, we are not prepared\\nto live under the sword of Damocles that terrorism\\nrepresents.\\nThe murderous attack on the people and the\\nAdministration of the United States was also an attack\\non all open societies. Countless States mourn their\\ncountrymen among the thousands of World Trade\\nCenter victims. The attack could have struck any open\\nsociety, but the terrorists consciously chose the United\\nStates as a symbol of freedom and democracy.\\nWe know that the new totalitarian challenge is\\nalso directed at us all. Since 11 September 2001, the\\ncommunity of nations has had to look at the question of\\npeace and security at the dawn of the twenty-first\\ncentury from a whole new angle. We will not be able to\\nnegotiate with terrorists like Osama bin Laden. His aim\\nis to kill as many innocent people as possible, thus\\ncreating the maximum degree of terror and fear. If the\\nterrorists succeed in acquiring weapons that are yet\\nmore horrific, they will deploy them against us all\\nwithout hesitation. Therefore, we must work together\\nin the international coalition against terrorism to\\novercome and destroy that international terrorist\\nnetwork. The highly dangerous combination of\\nreligious hatred, smouldering regional conflicts,\\nterrorist attacks and the danger of the deployment of\\nweapons of mass destruction must be prevented at any\\nprice.\\nBut, above all else, we must not forget: on the\\none hand, terrorism must be fought resolutely by the\\nmilitary and police; on the other, we need to resolve the\\npolitical and social conflicts quite rightly emphasized\\nin the Millennium Declaration, as they form the\\nbreeding ground for the emergence of terrorism. Opting\\nfor one approach and neglecting the other risks failure.\\nOur common goal is for the people in our\\ncountries to be able to live in safety and freedom, and\\nwithout want. To achieve that, we need a system of\\nglobal cooperative security that, unlike the former\\nbipolarity of the cold war, includes all levels of global\\npolicy relevant to security: the relations among great\\n17\\n\\nPowers and their alliances as well as the potential\\ndanger of regional crises and the threat posed by\\nasymmetrical conflicts. For one thing is clearer than\\never after 11 September: terrorism threatens world\\npeace just as much as civil war and regional conflicts.\\nSuch a system, therefore, must not be toothless, but\\nrather must function in all three fields through reliable\\nverification systems and enforceable sanctions\\nmechanisms. I am convinced that developing such a\\ncomprehensive system of global cooperative security\\nwill be our central political task for the twenty-first\\ncentury.\\nThis problem can be solved only through\\nmultilateralism — that is, if nations work together.\\nTerrorism does not stop at national borders, and\\nshaping globalization is a task that Governments can\\nno longer tackle alone. Thus, the United Nations has a\\nmajor role to play in developing this security system; it\\nis the most important forum for establishing global\\nrules. No other organization has comparable legitimacy\\nand credibility. Decisively strengthening its ability to\\nact by continuing the reform path of the Secretary-\\nGeneral is, therefore, a central focus of German foreign\\npolicy.\\nThe developments in Iraq fill us with grave\\nconcern. Saddam Hussein's regime is a brutal\\ndictatorship. Under his leadership, Iraq has attacked its\\nneighbours Iran and Kuwait, has fired missiles at Israel\\nand has used poison gas against Iran and against its\\nown Kurdish population. The regime is horrendous for\\nthe Iraqi people and a risk to the region. For that\\nreason, an effective containment policy and reliable\\nmilitary control of the no-fly zones have been\\nimplemented and a strict sanctions regime against Iraq\\nhas been introduced since the Gulf War.\\nThe regime in Baghdad must not own or produce\\nthe means for mass destruction or the systems to\\ndeliver them. Despite binding demands from the\\nSecurity Council, Saddam Hussein refuses to provide\\ncredible and verifiable answers to the pressing\\nquestions posed by the community of nations regarding\\nhis weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the United\\nNations not only must maintain the pressure on the\\nIraqi Government but also must intensify it.\\nWe welcome the fact that President Bush, in his\\nmost recent speech, turned towards the Security\\nCouncil. Even if it becomes very difficult, we must do\\neverything possible to find a diplomatic solution.\\nThe Security Council and Member States must\\nmake it unequivocally clear to Baghdad that the\\nunrestricted and unconditional re-admission of the\\nweapons inspectors is the only way to avert a great\\ntragedy for Iraq and the entire region. The Iraqi\\nGovernment must implement all relevant Security\\nCouncil resolutions in their entirety and without delay.\\nWe do not, however, want any automatism\\nleading to the use of military force. The fight against\\ninternational terrorism remains perilous. We have not\\nyet managed to fully stabilize Afghanistan. Explosive\\nregional conflicts in Kashmir, the Middle East and the\\nCaucasus must be resolved or at least effectively\\ncontained.\\nCertain central questions arise for us. Have all\\neconomic and political means of pressure been truly\\nexhausted? What consequences would military\\nintervention have? What would it mean for regional\\nstability? What effect would it have on the Middle East\\nconflict? Are there new, concrete findings and facts?\\nDoes the situation as assessed justify the taking of a\\ngreat risk, namely, taking responsibility for peace and\\nstability in the entire region for years or even decades\\nto come? Would such action gain the consent of the\\nArab neighbours? What consequences would it have\\nfor the continuation of the global coalition against\\nterrorism? In the face of these open questions, we feel\\ndeep scepticism with regard to military action and thus\\nhold to our approach.\\nI would like to pose the further question of\\nwhether a peaceful solution to the question of the\\nMiddle East could not contribute considerably more to\\nthe establishment of regional stability, to the successful\\nfight against terrorism and to the effective control and\\ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction. In that\\nway, would the regime in Baghdad not be isolated\\nmuch more effectively, thus generating political\\npressure for change? Would this cooperative approach\\nto finding a new order for the region not be a more\\npromising way to bring democracy to the Middle\\nEast — one that would be supported by the regional\\nPowers?\\nNowhere is the connection between terrorism and\\nregional conflict more obvious than in the Near and\\nMiddle East. The breakthrough to peace is therefore of\\nparamount importance in that region of the world. The\\nconsensus among the international community of\\nnations on the Middle East question is now greater than\\n18\\n\\never. We must all pull together to achieve the goal\\nenvisaged by President Bush for 2005, that of two\\nStates, Israel and a democratic Palestine, living as\\nneighbours within secure and recognized borders. The\\nEuropean Union has devised a road map to achieve that\\ngoal. An early conference on the Middle East could\\nhelp to build bridges and accelerate the process.\\nTogether with our European Union partners, we are\\nready to make a considerable contribution in that\\nrespect.\\nA comprehensive peace in the Middle East must\\nalso include Lebanon and Syria. Saudi Arabia's\\nsignificant initiative contains the assurance that the\\nArab world would then also be ready to fully normalize\\nits relations with Israel.\\nWithout a just and lasting solution to regional\\nconflicts, we will not be able to eliminate the\\nrecruitment base for terrorists and thus successfully\\ncounter the asymmetrical threat. Afghanistan is an\\nobvious example here. The Taliban system has\\ncollapsed there and the Al Qaeda network has largely\\nbeen destroyed. We are still a long way from being able\\nto call the situation in the country stable and secure,\\nbut progress can be noted. The implementation of the\\nprovisions of the Bonn Conference agreement began\\nwith the formation of a legitimate Interim\\nAdministration. The process that was launched on the\\nPetersberg was taken to the next level with the\\nconvening in June of the emergency loya jirga. For the\\nfirst time in years, the Afghan people have the chance\\nto lead a life of dignity based on self-determination.\\nThe people of Afghanistan will only grow in\\ncourage, however, when they see and feel that the\\ninternational community is also standing by its pledges\\nfor the reconstruction of their country. The\\ncommitments of the donor countries must materialize\\nin the form of concrete projects.\\nA system of global cooperative security must be\\nbased on a comprehensive security concept. This must\\nembrace not only military security but also the\\neconomy, human rights, democracy and culture.\\n“To achieve a safer world, we must create a better\\nworld”: that is how President Bush summed up the\\nsituation in his impressive speech to the German\\nBundestag last May. Shaping cooperative global\\nsecurity therefore also means shaping a new global\\neconomic order. Account must be taken of the needs of\\nall — the developing and the developed world alike.\\nResources must be more fairly distributed and poorer\\ncountries must be able to participate in international\\ntrade and take advantage of the opportunities of\\nglobalization. This will necessitate free market access\\nfor all, as well as the realization of economic and\\npolitical freedoms and a just and reliable legal\\nframework.\\nWe must not close our eyes to the problems of\\nAfrica, in particular. The food situation in the South of\\nthe continent is a particular source of concern.\\nCountless people are going hungry and comprehensive\\nassistance is needed there. In Zimbabwe, however, the\\nformer granary of Africa, a wholly irresponsible policy\\nis the reason for the difficult situation. In Zimbabwe,\\nhunger is caused principally not by failed harvests or\\ndroughts but by self-destructive governance — a policy\\nof keeping a grip on power through the suffering of the\\npeople. Such a policy relies upon the fact that the\\ninternational community's humanitarian conscience\\nand readiness to assume responsibility will reduce the\\nconsequences. We must hold this policy up against the\\nbenchmarks defined by Africa itself in the framework\\nof the New Partnership for Africa's Development.\\nClimate and energy policy is a key component of\\nthe new global economic order. The Kyoto Protocol\\ncan be seen as a milestone in global climate protection.\\nI am delighted that several countries have recently\\nannounced plans to ratify the Protocol, and hope that\\nthis will happen as soon as possible so that it can enter\\ninto force. In the long term, a sensible energy policy —\\nand that means, above all, the promotion of renewable\\nenergy sources and economical energy consumption —\\nis the best solution to the climate problem. Work must\\ntherefore start today. Let us not forget that difficult\\neconomic and ecological problems, with their social\\nand humanitarian repercussions, will increasingly\\nendanger stability and security too.\\nThe protection of human rights must be one of the\\npillars of a global security system. All efforts to secure\\npeace will fail if human rights are not protected and\\nmade a reality. We need a binding global set of values\\nto prevent and overcome conflicts that emerge through\\ninequality, injustice and the denial of freedom. Here,\\ntoo, States are called upon to play a decisive and active\\nrole. Moreover, we must be careful today to ensure that\\nbasic human rights are not annulled under the pretext\\nof combating terrorism. No one has the right to an\\n“anti-terrorism bonus”.\\n19\\n\\nCooperative global security will have to measure\\nup to the binding legal framework in which it is\\nembedded. It is imperative for the globalization process\\nto be flanked by a growing set of international rules,\\nbecause international law and the rule of law constitute\\nthe indispensable foundations for peaceful and ordered\\ncoexistence. That is why the establishment of the\\nInternational Criminal Court is so important to us. Its\\nStatute entered into force on 1 July; Germany, along\\nwith all the other members of the European Union, is\\namong the 79 States to have ratified it. The Assembly\\nof States Parties gave the green light this week to the\\nestablishment of the Court. Next spring we will\\ncelebrate its opening in The Hague. The International\\nCriminal Court will start work as soon as possible and\\nas efficiently as possible. But it must not be weakened\\nin its work from the outset.\\nMy country is applying for a non-permanent seat\\non the Security Council for the period 2003-2004.\\nGermany wants to play an active role in developing the\\ninternational security system within the United Nations\\nalong the lines that I have outlined. I would like to ask\\nall members for their vote in the election on 27\\nSeptember.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffIt is\\nimperative, now more than ever before, that all the\\npeoples of the world act in a spirit of solidarity. The\\nUnited Nations embodies this spirit. In joining the\\nUnited Nations, Switzerland sends you a message of\\nsolidarity. This makes me proud and happy.\\nI would like to add my thanks to those expressed\\nlast Tuesday by Kaspar Villiger, the President of the\\nSwiss Confederation, on the occasion of Switzerland's\\nformal admission to the United Nations. I would also\\nlike to thank all the Members of the United Nations for\\nthe warm welcome they have given my country.\\nSwitzerland feels welcomed. We feel that we are where\\nwe belong.\\nI would also like to give Secretary-General Kofi\\nAnnan my profound thanks. His sincerity and wisdom\\ncontributed greatly to convincing the people of\\nSwitzerland of the need to join the United Nations.\\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\\nelection. I already know and value your qualities and\\ntalents and I know that you will put them to the best\\nservice of the United Nations. Switzerland is pleased to\\nbe working with you towards the success of this\\nsession of the General Assembly.\\nThe Swiss people have decided to join the United\\nNations. They have said yes' to increased cooperation\\nwith the United Nations. They have said yes' to a\\nstronger international commitment. They have said\\nyes' to taking greater responsibility for meeting the\\nchallenges that face humankind.\\nThe challenges facing the international\\ncommunity at the beginning of the twenty-first century\\nare immense. A number of regions suffer from terrible\\npoverty. Crises and wars are rife on all continents.\\nThere are millions of refugees. We see the hideous face\\nof terrorism. Criminal networks exploit human beings\\nand traffic shamefully in drugs and arms. New diseases\\nare emerging and, day after day, we continue to destroy\\nthe Earth's ecological balance.\\nThere are no simple answers to any of these\\nproblems, but there is a place where we can all meet to\\nfind solutions: the United Nations. The world needs a\\nstrong United Nations, as it is the only universal\\nOrganization working at the global level. It alone can\\nanalyse problems at the world level. It alone can create\\na consensus between States on common goals. Finally,\\nas stressed by the Secretary-General, there is no\\nsubstitute for the unique international legitimacy\\nprovided to principles and choices of action by the\\nUnited Nations.\\nSwitzerland has joined the United Nations as a\\nneutral country and we intend to remain neutral. Our\\nneutral status, however, in no way diminishes our\\ndesire for cooperation. On the contrary, it is an\\nadvantage for our peace activities. Our membership of\\nthe United Nations is not a change in direction, but the\\nlogical consequence of our foreign policy.\\nTo quote our Constitution, the Swiss\\nConfederation is committed Ö to a just and peaceful\\ninternational order'. The principal aim of the United\\nNations is to maintain international peace and security.\\nFor us, therefore, the United Nations is the ideal place\\nto carry out this vital mission. As a Member of the\\nUnited Nations, Switzerland will devote itself\\nresolutely to international peace and security. That\\ncommitment will be focused, above all, on armed\\n27\\n\\nconflicts. The logic of armed conflicts today forces us\\nto adopt a multidimensional approach to peace\\nprocesses. If we are to succeed, we must work in\\nseveral different areas in parallel: military, diplomatic,\\nhumanitarian and economic. We must also involve all\\ninterested players in the process. All this demands a\\nmajor effort of coordination, and Switzerland will\\ncontribute to that.\\nSecurity problems, moreover, must be addressed\\nfrom a broader angle  that of human security. The\\ninhabitants of this world must be able to live without\\nfear of war, starvation and despotism. In particular, we\\nmust protect vulnerable individuals and groups.\\nSwitzerland will therefore pursue its efforts in favour\\nof human security. This includes stopping the\\nrecruitment of child soldiers, eliminating anti-\\npersonnel mines and halting the proliferation of small\\narms.\\nIn this context, I welcome the Secretary-\\nGeneral's appeal to make full use of multilateral\\ninstitutions. This is especially valid for the\\nmaintenance of international peace and security. There\\nis only one source of legitimacy for the use of force:\\nthe United Nations.\\nIraq has been discussed on several occasions\\nduring these past days. There is undeniably a need to\\nact, and to act with determination, in order to ensure\\nthe implementation of United Nations resolutions, but\\naction must be taken together, within the United\\nNations. Only the United Nations can confer\\ninternational legitimacy to any action against Iraq.\\nSwitzerland is convinced that peace and\\ndevelopment can be sustained only if they go hand in\\nhand with freedom, democracy, and respect for human\\nrights. Human dignity is our most precious asset. It\\nmust be defended at all times and in all places. We will\\nchampion this conviction at the United Nations to the\\nfull and without concessions. For as long as men and\\nwomen are exploited, children are mistreated and the\\ndeath penalty is carried out, Switzerland will do\\neverything within its power to defend human dignity.\\nAt the General Assembly this year, we will strive\\nin particular to promote the adoption of the draft\\noptional protocol to the United Nations Convention\\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\\nTreatment or Punishment. This protocol is needed to\\ngive better protection to people in detention against\\ntorture and mistreatment. That is why we have been\\nsupporting this initiative for years.\\nIn its capacity as the Depositary State,\\nSwitzerland feels a special responsibility to promote\\nawareness of and respect for the Geneva Conventions\\nand their Additional Protocols. At the United Nations,\\nwe will continue tirelessly to defend these instruments.\\nIn this area, Switzerland has submitted to a number of\\ncountries involved in the Middle East conflict a\\nproposal which aims to ensure the better\\nimplementation of international humanitarian law. We\\nadvocate two mechanisms: one for promoting dialogue\\nto allow the parties to settle problems concerning the\\napplication of international humanitarian law; the\\nsecond, a mechanism to monitor respect for\\nhumanitarian law.\\nWe are also convinced that the International\\nCriminal Court will ensure the better application of\\ninternational humanitarian law. This new Court is an\\nessential tool for dealing with serious violations of the\\nfundamental human freedoms. We will therefore\\nremain on our guard to ensure that it can function\\nefficiently and we will pursue our efforts to convince\\nthose States that have not yet signed the Rome Statute\\nof the need for such a Court.\\nTwo days ago, we commemorated the tragic\\nevents that shook the United States and the world one\\nyear ago. The causes of terrorism must be eradicated. I\\nam thinking, inter alia, of injustice, disregard for the\\nrights of minorities, and poverty. That is one of the\\nobjectives of our development cooperation and of our\\nhuman rights policy.\\nSustainable development and the elimination of\\npoverty remain mankind's main challenges today. We\\nsaw that again at Johannesburg. They are global\\nchallenges that require a global strategy and global\\nsolidarity. In other words, they require coordinated\\naction by the United Nations institutions, as well as\\ngreater cooperation between the United Nations, the\\ndevelopment banks, civil society and the private sector.\\nDevelopment cooperation must be coordinated.\\nSwitzerland will contribute to strengthening the\\ncoordination efforts vital to ensuring that our activities\\nenjoy the success they merit.\\nThe struggle against poverty also requires greater\\nexchange of expertise and better transfer of technology.\\nSwitzerland is closely involved in the preparation of\\nthe World Summit on the Information Society, the first\\n28\\n\\nphase of which will take place in Geneva in 2003. The\\nmain challenge of that Summit is the very gap between\\nNorth and South in terms of access to new information\\ntechnologies. Therefore, I call on all to contribute\\nactively to the success of that conference.\\nThese thoughts lead me to refer to Geneva, the\\ninternational city that is a close and longstanding link\\nbetween my country and the United Nations.\\nSwitzerland is proud and grateful to be able to host the\\nEuropean Headquarters of the United Nations and\\nmany specialized agencies. Geneva is the main\\ninternational hub of disarmament, humanitarian aid,\\nsocial development, the promotion of human rights and\\nenvironmental protection. That gives me great\\npleasure, because Swiss citizens are particularly\\nconcerned about these issues. However, that also\\ninvolves the special responsibility of offering\\ninternational organizations optimum working and\\nliving conditions. You can also count on Switzerland in\\nthat area.\\nBefore Switzerland became a Member, the United\\nNations was already a universal Organization, but with\\nSwitzerland  and soon Timor-Leste  the United\\nNations will be even more universal. The United\\nNations is the greatest world forum. Switzerland will\\nprovide it its full support in the interests of humanity\\nand the interests of we, the peoples of the United\\nNations.\", \"\\ufeffThe smoke\\nat ground zero, only a few blocks away from here, has\\ncleared. But the empty space where the twin towers\\nonce stood continues to send shivers throughout the\\nworld. The unspeakable events that occurred a year ago\\nhave become engraved in our collective memory. What\\noccurred here was an unprecedented and direct attack\\non universal values: values such as mutual respect,\\nsuch as tolerance, such as the rule of law — values that\\nform the very basis of the United Nations.\\nOver the past year, the world community has\\nproven its determination to defy terrorism. Today, the\\nNetherlands not only reiterates its attachment to these\\nvalues but also underlines a responsibility, both\\nindividual and collective, for upholding and protecting\\nthem. And that responsibility calls for a real\\ncommitment.\\nReligions, races and traditions make our world\\ncolourful and diverse. But underneath our different\\nfeathers, we share a common skin: principles we all\\nadhere to — or should adhere to — regardless of our\\nreligious beliefs or race. Mutual respect, the rule of\\nlaw, freedom of speech and religion are among the\\nmost important ones.\\nWe cannot, however, confine ourselves to merely\\nrestating these principles. Without real commitment\\nthey would quickly evaporate and thus become empty\\nwords.\\nIt goes without saying that the Netherlands is\\nfully committed: it is a dedicated international partner,\\nboth out of choice and out of necessity, in the United\\nNations, the European Union, NATO and other\\norganizations, or in common endeavours such as the\\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. The\\nNetherlands will continue to dedicate 0.8 per cent of its\\nannual gross domestic product to development\\ncooperation and urges others to do the same.\\nBehind that commitment is the unshakeable belief\\nthat no country can hope to succeed on its own in\\nwhatever policy area. In this respect we take to heart\\nthe wise words of Secretary-General Kofi Annan:\\n“Even the most powerful countries know that they need\\nto work with others, in multilateral institutions, to\\nachieve their aims” (A/57/PV.2). We therefore also\\nwelcome the United States decision, announced from\\nthis rostrum by President Bush, to return to the United\\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\\nOrganization (UNESCO). The Netherlands not only\\nfeels an individual responsibility for the defence of\\nuniversal values, but a shared responsibility as well.\\nLet me elaborate on this today in relation to four key\\nareas of concern: the development of the African\\ncontinent, uncontrolled migration, the continuing threat\\nof terrorism and the situation in the Middle East.\\nAfrica continues its struggle towards\\ndevelopment and prosperity. It cannot and must not do\\nso all by itself. We all share a responsibility for\\neradicating poverty and enhancing Africa's global\\nintegration.\\nToo often the African continent is associated only\\nwith misery and instability. In reality the number of\\nconflicts in or between African countries has\\ndecreased. The creation of the African Union, and the\\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development, testify to\\nthe continent's own commitment. The Netherlands very\\n15\\n\\nmuch welcomes this acknowledgement by African\\nleaders of their own responsibility for building a\\nprosperous and peaceful continent. For us, this is\\nessential for adding our own efforts and resources to\\nachieve that objective. It also means that African\\nleaders, like all of us, can be held accountable for their\\ngovernance and policies, their performance in the field\\nof human rights and their respect for the rule of law.\\nIn partnership with African countries the\\nNetherlands will continue to do its share in providing\\nthe necessary resources. For us, development\\ncooperation is not just providing money, but also a\\npolicy integrating the promotion of good governance,\\nsecurity and stability. Is the world to assist in\\nalleviating the effects of natural disasters when in fact\\nthey are, at least in part, man-made?\\nResponsibility also extends to the private sector,\\nparticularly when it comes to fighting the disease that\\nundermines all efforts at development: HIV/AIDS.\\nHowever, for the fight against AIDS to be successful, it\\nneeds to be fully endorsed by African Governments.\\nThat means: acknowledgement of the problem and its\\ncauses, an open discussion of possible strategies and\\naddressing its consequences for society.\\nAfrica concerns us all. Its problems affect us all.\\nPoverty, conflict and violations of human rights\\ncontribute to an ever-increasing migration. This\\nphenomenon is, however, by no means unique for the\\nAfrican continent. We need to deal with it effectively,\\nregardless of whether we represent countries of origin,\\ncountries of transit or those of destination. Migration is\\nrobbing countries of origin of a vitally important\\nresource: human capital. For neighbouring countries or\\ncountries of transit it can be a source of instability. For\\ncountries of destination, it often creates problems of\\nintegration.\\nHere again, common values are at stake.\\nGovernments should do everything in their power to\\navoid people having no other choice than fleeing home.\\nThe number one priority is addressing the underlying\\ncauses of uncontrolled migration.\\nIn the meantime, we need to support the Office of\\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\\n(UNHCR), which is stretched to its limits dealing with\\na problem for which it was not devised. The\\nNetherlands welcomes UNHCR's efforts to establish\\nand implement an integrated policy aimed at the\\nrepatriation of refugees, coupled with their re-\\nintegration, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\\nObviously, these efforts have to be dovetailed with\\nthose of other United Nations agencies active in those\\nareas.\\nIt is precisely through such an integrated\\napproach that we can hope to achieve results.\\nUNHCR's mix of policy areas obviously has to be\\ncomplemented by that of security. That is one of the\\nreasons why the Netherlands is involved in\\npeacekeeping or similar operations in Bosnia, the\\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)\\nand Afghanistan. Security is the quintessential\\nconsideration for those who are to return to their\\nhomes. Without security, resettlement and recovery\\nremain pious wishes. Money spent on security is\\nmoney well spent.\\nIn the year following 11 September 2001 the\\ninternational community has effectively taken its\\nresponsibility. Its joint efforts have focussed on\\nbringing about more security and increased stability in\\nAfghanistan. Much has been accomplished: a regime\\nhostile both to the Afghan people and to our commonly\\nshared values has been ousted. Subsequently, our\\ncollective efforts have helped establish an elected\\nGovernment and begin the reconstruction of a\\ndisrupted society.\\nThere can be no leniency towards countries that\\nreject universal values, because a country that rejects\\ntolerance, endorses intolerance. A country that does not\\nguarantee the rule of law invites anarchy and injustice.\\nThe international community must help countries that\\nare unable to do so themselves. It must try to persuade\\nthose that are uncooperative and it must be ready, if\\nnecessary, to act against those that are unwilling.\\nThe terrorist attacks have also shown that\\nreligion, for some, unfortunately, is a source of\\ninspiration not for good, but for destructive purposes.\\nThe hijacking of planes should not result in the\\nhijacking of an entire religion. Proper education,\\nfreedom of opinion and speech, secular or\\nrepresentative government can help contain religious\\nextremism. Here again, we have a collective as well as\\nan individual responsibility for upholding and\\nprotecting common values.\\nWhat we need is a dialogue between countries,\\ncivilizations and religions. But we also need action to\\ngo after the sources of religious extremism.\\n16\\n\\nThat same commitment leaves us no choice but to\\ncontinue to work towards peace in the Middle East.\\nThe instability there, the lurking dangers of religious\\nextremism and weapons of mass destruction require\\nour joint dedication.\\nThe many different actors in the Middle East\\nshare a duty to restrain violence and curtail extremism.\\nStability in the region is an indivisible interest, not\\nonly for the region itself but far beyond. The countries\\nin the region have prime responsibility for ensuring\\nthat their citizens can live in freedom and an\\nenvironment of tolerance and respect. But the\\ninternational community has a role to play as well.\\nHere in particular, we expect the Security Council to\\ntake its responsibilities to end the Iraqi regime's\\nsystematic non-compliance with a range of earlier\\nresolutions. The inspectors should be allowed to return,\\nyesterday rather than tomorrow. The credibility of the\\nUnited Nations system is at stake.\\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be dealt\\nwith solely by concentrating on the fight against\\nterrorism. Terrorism must stop, not only because of the\\nhuman suffering it causes, but also because it is utterly\\ncounterproductive. The Palestinian people should ask\\nthemselves where this violence has got them. On the\\nother hand, Israel cannot defer indefinitely answering\\nthe question as to when and how it is to live side by\\nside with a Palestinian neighbour. Finding a solution\\nagain requires true commitment from all parties\\nconcerned and a dialogue across regional, religious and\\nother borders. That involves us all.\\nIn conclusion, since we share values, we share\\nresponsibility for upholding them. That should\\ndetermine our commitment to addressing the problems\\nthat I mentioned. Our commonly held values should\\nguide our dealings with each other — between\\nindividuals as well as between countries. It is only\\nwhen we acknowledge what we have in common that\\nwe can find the strength to overcome our differences. If\\nthere is one thing that our presence here, one year after\\n11 September 2001, makes clear, it is this: our belief in\\nfreedom and tolerance is unshakeable, and so is our\\ncommitment to uphold them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffLet me begin\\nby welcoming Switzerland, our western neighbour, as a\\nfull member of the United Nations and her first\\nparticipation in the General Assembly after her\\naccession. Without our Swiss friends the United\\nNations would not be complete. Expanding the global\\nreach of the United Nations can be seen as a positive\\naspect of globalization.\\nHaving supported United Nations efforts to bring\\nabout a solution to the East Timor conflict for many\\nyears, Austria also looks forward to 27 September and\\nwishes to congratulate East Timor on becoming the\\n191st Member of the United Nations.\\nAustria fully aligns itself with the statement made\\nby the Prime Minister of Denmark on behalf of the\\nEuropean Union. I should like to add a few\\nobservations to that very comprehensive statement.\\nLet me reiterate the sympathy of the Austrian\\npeople for the victims of 11 September 2001. Austria\\nhas shown strong solidarity from the first hour after the\\nattacks and has acted in unison with her European\\npartners and the United Nations to combat terrorism —\\na resolve that remains strong and will continue to do\\nso.\\nAs a former staff member of the United Nations, I\\nwish to convey my country's sincere gratitude to the\\nmany dedicated people who are in the service of the\\nUnited Nations in New York and at the other\\nheadquarters in Vienna and Geneva, as well as out\\nthere in the field, for their efforts on behalf of the\\ninternational community in its fight against terror.\\nCombating terrorism requires a global effort and\\na comprehensive approach: prevention and the\\nprotection of the security of our countries and of the\\nbasic values of freedom and human rights, as well as\\ncoercive measures as a last resort. We must, however,\\nbase our decisions and actions on international law.\\nThe Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee\\n(CTC) under the very able leadership of Sir Jeremy\\nGreenstock, Ambassador of the United Kingdom, is at\\nthe core of the United Nations coordinating role.\\nWe must ensure that all States join and can join\\nthose efforts. To promote that goal, Austria hosted a\\nsymposium on combating international terrorism at the\\nVienna International Centre in June of this year, which\\nhighlighted the capacity of the Vienna-based United\\nNations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention\\n(ODCCP) to provide efficient technical assistance to\\nMember States in their fight against terrorism. Austria\\nwill make an additional million euros available for the\\nstrengthening of the ODCCP.\\nI am glad to note that Secretary-General Kofi\\nAnnan shares our view on the importance of the\\nVienna-based United Nations units, as expressed in his\\nreport on the need to strengthen the Terrorism\\nPrevention Branch of the Secretariat. The report of\\nPolicy Working Group on the United Nations and\\nTerrorism published earlier this week comes to the\\nsame conclusion. I therefore call upon the Member\\nStates to support that position.\\nIt is also important to remind ourselves that the\\nfight against terrorism cannot be fought with soldiers\\nand policemen alone; we also need to fight the root\\ncauses: the abject levels of poverty, inequality,\\n16\\n\\ninjustice, the lack of sustainable development and of\\ngood governance.\\nWhen it comes to dangers for world security, we\\nalso have to focus on unresolved and perilous regional\\nconflicts, such as in the Middle East. What is needed is\\nan effort to speedily arrive at a political solution\\nproviding for two States, Israel and Palestine, within\\nsecure and recognized borders. Austria seconds the\\nidea of an early international conference with the\\nsupport of the Quartet and interested countries of the\\nregion aimed at finding solutions to the political issues\\nsuch as the final borders of the two States, the final\\nstatus of Jerusalem and the question of refugees.\\nAustria considers the newly designed road map of the\\nEuropean Union towards the establishment of an\\nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State in the next\\nthree years to be a good basis for achieving a final and\\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict in accordance\\nwith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\\n(1973) and 1397 (2002), taking into consideration the\\nArab peace plan adopted in Beirut as well.\\nWhile continuing to respect the elected leadership\\nof the Palestinian people the European Union has\\nexpressed its readiness to give all necessary and\\npossible support to the reform process of the\\nPalestinian Authority. Austria participates actively in\\nthose efforts. Austria is also deeply concerned that\\nhuman suffering in the conflict has attained\\nunacceptable levels, be it as a result of terror or of\\ncountermeasures.\\nThe Middle East has also garnered the attention\\nof the international community in the context of the\\ndanger of the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction. The growing tensions result from the\\ncontinued non-compliance with United Nations\\nSecurity Council resolutions on the part of Iraq. The\\npotential threat of weapons of mass destruction\\nendangering world peace through such policies should\\nnot and cannot be tolerated. For that reason Austria\\nsupports the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to\\nbring about the speedy, unfettered and unconditional\\nreturn of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq,\\nalong with full compliance with the obligations\\ncontained in all relevant Security Council resolutions.\\nAustria welcomes the statement of President\\nGeorge Bush seeking broad international and\\nmultilateral support and cooperation with the Security\\nCouncil on the issue of how to deal with the threat\\nemanating from regimes that support terror or seek to\\nacquire weapons of mass destruction. Only the Security\\nCouncil can provide the legitimacy we need. At the\\nsame time, it is evident that the Security Council itself\\nhas to take responsibility for ensuring full compliance\\nwith its resolutions in order to maintain world peace.\\nThe conflict between India and Pakistan over the\\nissue of Kashmir also needs an urgent political\\nsolution. The consequences of an escalation could be\\ncatastrophic for the region and beyond.\\nIn recent weeks, we have been starkly reminded\\nof the fact that Afghanistan, which has been wrested\\nfrom Taliban and Al Qaeda rule and has had a\\npromising new start with the assistance of the\\ninternational community, has yet to achieve a lasting\\npeace and stability. The international community\\nshould remain committed and has to continue its\\nsupport of the new Government of Afghanistan.\\nThe fight against terrorism and violent\\nfundamentalism in Afghanistan has also highlighted the\\nimportance of the whole region of Central Asia. During\\nits chairmanship of the Organization for Security and\\nCooperation in Europe in 2000, Austria made it a\\npriority to draw the attention of world opinion to the\\nunresolved issues and problems and to the very\\nimpressive potential of that region given mutually\\nuseful cooperation and good governance.\\nTurning to our own neighbourhood, I want to\\nreiterate the importance Austria attributes to European\\nUnion enlargement and our firm commitment to\\nfinalizing the ongoing negotiating process towards the\\nend of this year. Austria looks forward to welcoming\\nnew members by 2004, thus turning the vision of a\\nunited Europe into reality and extending the European\\nzone of peace, stability and welfare to the whole\\ncontinent and beyond.\\nI am glad to note that South-Eastern Europe has\\nmade substantial progress towards stability generated\\nby various multilateral initiatives, particularly the\\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe and the Zagreb\\nprocess. As an additional instrument for enhancing\\ndevelopment in that region, in May of this year the\\nDanube Cooperation Project was launched in Vienna,\\nthe aim of which is to make use of the Danube River as\\nan integrative factor connecting the 13 countries of the\\nwhole Danube basin.\\n17\\n\\nThe dialogue among civilizations, which Austria\\nhas strongly supported from the beginning, is a new\\nand important tool of diplomacy that should help us\\ndrain the breeding grounds of terrorism. In order to\\ntake this dialogue from the elites to the general public,\\nwe need to cooperate with the media. To that end, I\\norganized an expert seminar on the role of the media in\\nthe framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership\\nin June of this year. This effort is designed to lead,\\nhopefully, to a media code of conduct to emanate from\\nthe media themselves in order to create better\\nunderstanding between the cultures and commonly to\\nproject messages shedding a positive light on cultural\\ndiversity.\\nAs of July of this year, Austria has chaired the\\nHuman Security Network, the only interregional\\ngrouping in the United Nations framework particularly\\npropelling issues of human security. In my capacity as\\nChairperson of that group, I have put the following two\\nissues at the top of our agenda: the needs for a globally\\nshared acquisition of a human rights culture through\\nhuman rights education and for effectively addressing\\nthe terrible plight suffered by an ever-growing number\\nof children in the world exposed to the horrors of\\narmed conflict. The first “human rights city” in Europe,\\nthe Austrian city of Graz, will also host next year's\\nministerial meeting of the Human Security Network. In\\nthis context I should also like to express Austria's\\nstrong support for the adoption of the draft protocol of\\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,\\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\\nIn my function as President of the Human\\nSecurity Network, I have also taken the initiative, in\\nthe framework of the group of female foreign\\nministers, to raise the issue of Amina Lawal in a\\ncommon letter to the Foreign Minister of Nigeria in\\norder to remind Nigeria of its obligations under\\ninternational human rights law.\\nIn the Millennium Declaration, we set clear\\ntargets for our combined development efforts as\\nMember States. We all did this in recognition of the\\npriority attached to the fight against poverty and for a\\nbetter and more equitable world. Disastrous floods in\\nparts of Central Europe, including my own country, in\\nAsia and the Americas, as well as droughts in other\\nparts of the world just before the start of the World\\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg,\\nwere a painful indication of changes rendering\\nsustainable development even more important. The\\nSummit brought about an action programme and a\\npolitical declaration, which we welcome, although we\\nwould have wished to take some issues even further,\\nsuch as in the field of renewable energy. I share the\\nview of the Secretary-General that the Summit has\\ninstigated global action among a wide range of actors.\\nIt has highlighted the relationship between economy,\\necology, social issues and development. It has also\\nreaffirmed the Doha and Monterrey compromises.\\nThe follow-up will have to cut through the\\ncomplexities of the process and to pursue the most\\npressing issues. Implementation is the key word. This\\nwill be best accomplished by sectoral conferences on\\nthe major issues involved. Austria appreciates that the\\nSummit has helped convince some major countries to\\njoin the ranks of those, such as Austria, that have\\nalready ratified the Kyoto Protocol.\\nBefore closing, let me express my best wishes for\\na successful session of the Assembly under\\nMr. Kavan's guidance and allow me also to thank his\\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his leadership and\\nhis efforts towards strengthening the General\\nAssembly.\\nHaving returned deeply impressed from South\\nAfrica, let me close by quoting a real hero and a man\\nwho stands for his principles while promoting\\nreconciliation — Mr. Nelson Mandela. The following\\nquote is from the entrance to the Apartheid Museum in\\nJohannesburg, which I just visited: “To be free is not\\nmerely to put off one's chains, but to live in a way that\\nrespects and enhances the freedom of others.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffI wish at the outset to pay tribute to the\\nremarkable work of the Secretary-General, who,\\nthrough his outstanding personal qualities and sense of\\ndialogue, gives our Organization unparalleled\\ninfluence. I congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election\\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\\nseventh session. I also congratulate Switzerland on its\\nadmission to our Organization, and Timor-Leste on its\\nforthcoming admission.\\nA year ago, to our stunned horror, New York and\\nWashington were struck in unprecedented attacks.\\nFrom now on no one now can disregard the dark side\\nof the world: international terrorism that combines\\narchaism with technology, and shifting underground\\n28\\n\\ncriminal networks with a growing risk of the\\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\\nThese formidable opponents insinuate themselves\\ninto the heart of the world's complexity. They play on\\nfrustrations and resentment, hatred and fears. They foil\\nour plans; they know how to find weak spots and turn\\nour weapons against us. No, the world is definitely not\\nsuffering from an excess of power. To the contrary, it is\\nsuddenly discovering its extreme vulnerability.\\nFaced with these threats, the temptation to forge\\nblindly ahead could emerge. That would be a serious\\nmistake. Force cannot be the sole response to these\\nelusive adversaries that are constantly changing.\\nThe example of Afghanistan shows this.\\nMobilizing the international community enabled us to\\noverthrow a retrograde totalitarian regime that\\nharboured and supported the Al Qaeda network and\\ndealt a harsh blow to terrorist infrastructures. That was\\nnecessary, but it is not enough. We must now rebuild;\\nwe must help the Afghan people, maintain our efforts\\nover the long term, and continue our work to bring\\nabout stability and democracy, but also to dismantle the\\ndrug economy and the trafficking it fuels.\\nThe fact that force alone is often futile is one of\\nthe characteristics of our age. We live in a world that is\\ninterdependent, where cause and effect may be distant,\\nindirect and unpredictable. Let us take care that our\\ninterventions do not give rise to new frustrations,\\nproduce new imbalances or spark fires that we cannot\\nput out.\\nThe case of Iraq is typical of this new situation. It\\nis a country that has defied the authority of the Security\\nCouncil and flouted international law for years. It is a\\nregime that poses a grave threat to security, particularly\\nthe security of the peoples of its region, because of the\\nrisk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Its\\nconduct is the direct cause of the great suffering\\nendured by its people.\\nIs the international community concerned? Of\\ncourse it is. Can it continue to tolerate this situation?\\nDefinitely not. Should it act? Obviously: the status quo\\ncannot go on. France's determination to obtain\\ncompliance with the law is absolute.\\nWe must act, but we must do so effectively. We\\nmust act, but without risking results opposite to those\\nwe seek. We must take care not to exacerbate a\\nsituation that is already very disturbing. We must act,\\nbut there are many traps. Intervention that is politically\\nor legally ill-defined or poorly mounted would not\\ngarner the broad support necessary; it might galvanize\\npublic opinion in the region against it, and the regime\\nin Baghdad, which is isolated now, could benefit;\\nlastly, it might exacerbate tension in the Middle East\\nand beyond at a time when we should, on the contrary,\\nredouble our efforts to return to the path of dialogue\\nand peace.\\nHow are these traps to be avoided? How are we to\\nsucceed? There is only one way, and it is demanding. It\\nis the path of responsibility  collective responsibility.\\nThe world now is one of interdependence. Its stability\\nconcerns us all. All of us must contribute to it.\\nThe necessary measures must be adopted by the\\ninternational community after in-depth and transparent\\nconsideration. Any temptation to engage in unilateral\\npreventive action would be dangerous. We must take\\ncare to avoid any suspicion of bias or injustice. This is\\nthe only way to ensure that any action to enforce law\\nand restore security does not add to insecurity. That is\\nthe best guarantee of effectiveness.\\nThat is why, in the case of Iraq, France advocates\\na dÈmarche made completely legitimate by collective\\ndeliberation. It requires two successive steps. First, we\\nmust together reaffirm the need for United Nations\\ninspectors to return and demand that Iraq comply at\\nlast with its obligations under the Security Council\\ndecisions taken since 1991, and do so according to a\\ndefinite timetable. That is the objective of the\\ninternational community. It is also in Iraq's interest. If\\nBaghdad persists in its refusal to allow the inspectors\\nto return unconditionally, then there must be\\nconsequences. The Security Council should then decide\\non the measures to be taken without excluding any\\noption. Responsibilities would be clarified. The world\\nmust be able to act. But it must also be coherent and\\neffective, in a sustained way. That is today the real\\nchallenge to our values, and to our democracies.\\nI recently travelled to the Middle East, the\\nBalkans and Afghanistan. I realized the strength of the\\naspirations and hopes for peace. But I also saw how the\\nefforts and energies of various parties need to be united\\nand centred on a collective ambition.\\nNo Power can today assume sole responsibility\\nfor world equilibrium. The world aspires to be\\nstructured around poles of stability and progress. In\\naddition to the United States, the European Union is\\n29\\n\\nnaturally destined to form one such pole, along with\\nRussia, China, Japan and India, among others. In future\\neach actor must make its contribution to the effort. It is\\na common project that we must build.\\nThat is the ambition that inspires the European\\nUnion, and France's action within it. The Union affirms\\nits role on the world stage in the service of peace and\\nprosperity. It is acquiring the appropriate diplomatic\\nand defence instruments. With a view to major\\nenlargement, the Union is also committed to genuinely\\nre-making its design. That is the purpose of the\\nConvention on the Future of Europe, guided by the\\nprinciples of democracy and effectiveness for a future\\nEurope. In that way, the Union will contribute to the\\nstability of the continent and beyond. Finally, the\\nEuropean model reconciles in a unique way the\\nrequirements of social cohesion and economic\\nperformance to further a common plan, while\\nrespecting the diversity of all. For all those reasons, I\\nam convinced that Europe's voice offers elements for\\naddressing the major challenges of our time.\\nToday, power in all its aspects must be shared. It\\nis essential to listen to diverse approaches and points of\\nview. A dialogue among cultures is essential. Only this\\nwill enable us to understand the main issues today by\\ntaking into account the history and aspirations of every\\npeople and every country. Only this can prevent us\\nfrom having too narrow a conception of the world\\nbased on ignorance and on fear of the other. Only this\\ncan guide us in putting humankind back at the centre of\\nour concerns and at the heart of our action and our\\nshared commitment.\\nSharing means responding to the requirement of\\nsolidarity. Extreme poverty, famine, epidemics and\\nfinancial crises are factors contributing to disorder and\\nfomenting instability. Terrorism feeds on these things.\\nGenerosity must be the corollary of power. It is our\\npolitical and moral duty. It is also in our own interest.\\nAccordingly, France has pledged to augment its\\ndevelopment assistance, which will increase by 50 per\\ncent over the next five years.\\nOwing to its geographic proximity and historical\\nand cultural ties, my country has a deep friendship for\\nAfrica. It feels a special responsibility. That continent,\\nmore than others, needs the solidarity of the\\ninternational community in the difficult trials it is\\nexperiencing: the too-numerous conflicts that persist;\\nthe return of the spectre of famine; the economic\\ndifficulties; and the tragedy of AIDS, which today\\nstrikes nearly 30 million Africans.\\nYet Africa is rich in potential, rich in the\\nenthusiasm of its young people and in the energy of its\\ncivil society, and rich in memory, in tradition and in a\\ntreasury of wisdom from which we all have much to\\nlearn. Important efforts are under way today to advance\\nhuman rights, democracy, the fight against corruption,\\nand favourable economic and social policies for strong\\nand balanced growth. The establishment of the New\\nPartnership for Africa's Development attests to the\\ncontinent's willingness to take charge of its\\ndevelopment, in the context of a renewed partnership\\nwith the industrialized countries. Let us recognize and\\nsupport those efforts.\\nIn particular, we must help Africa to move\\nforward on the path of conflict resolution in Sierra\\nLeone, Liberia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and the Sudan. Those\\ntragedies concern us all, because today there are no\\nmore localized crises. Instability spreads. The\\ninternational community must mobilize.\\nIn the Great Lakes region, the agreements signed\\nat Lusaka, Pretoria and Luanda must be implemented.\\nThey must lead to the withdrawal of all foreign troops\\npresent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to\\nthe disarmament of foreign armed groups, to\\nreconciliation and to a return to peace.\\nWith regard to Western Sahara, it is good that the\\nSecurity Council, in its most recent resolution,\\nresolution 1429 (2002), gave Mr. James Baker the time\\nto work to bring the parties closer together. That time\\nmust be used to make progress.\\nWe must stay engaged in the Balkans, where the\\nprogress made this year must be consolidated in\\nKosovo, in the former Yugoslav Republic of\\nMacedonia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Linking\\nthe Balkans to Europe through the rule of law and\\ndemocracy is, more than ever before, our common\\naspiration.\\nIn the Middle East, we must emerge from the\\nimpasse and restore hope. The situation will worsen as\\nlong as the parties remain prisoners to the logic of\\nviolence. There is urgency to act. The Palestinian\\nAuthority must use all available means to prevent and\\ncurb terrorist actions. With a view to the creation of an\\nindependent, viable and democratic Palestinian State,\\n30\\n\\nbased on the 1967 borders, it must pursue its reforms,\\nparticularly in the institutional context.\\nFor its part, the State of Israel, while it\\nlegitimately wishes to defend itself against terrorism,\\nmust do so with respect for international law. The\\nsecurity imperative cannot by itself take the place of\\npolicy. Settlement-building must cease, and the Israeli\\narmed forces must withdraw from the occupied\\nterritories, as demanded by the Security Council.\\nMeasures must be taken quickly to improve the now\\nalarming humanitarian and social situation of the\\nPalestinian people.\\nOn the basis of Security Council resolutions 242\\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002) and the principle\\nof land for peace  which all the Arab countries,\\nmeeting in Beirut, agreed to recognize at the initiative\\nof Saudi Arabia  the political process must be\\nrelaunched with the aid of the `quartet'. We support\\nthe convening of an international conference at an early\\ndate. The objective must be a just, comprehensive and\\nlasting peace; a peace based on the coexistence of two\\nStates within secure and recognized borders,\\nguaranteeing security for the Israelis and offering the\\nPalestinians a normal life with dignity; a peace based\\non a comprehensive settlement of the regional conflict\\nbetween Israel and its neighbours.\\nThe attention that we pay to regional crises must\\nnot distract us from the responsibility that we must\\nassume in the face of global challenges. The United\\nNations is playing its full role in the fight against\\nterrorism. Let us do likewise in the other great\\nstruggles of our time.\\nLet us fight tirelessly against the proliferation of\\nweapons of mass destruction and their means of\\ndelivery. The President of the French Republic has\\nproposed that the Security Council meet at the highest\\nlevel in 2003, during the General Assembly, with a\\ndouble mandate: to review non-proliferation policy and\\nto give it a new impetus.\\nLet us mobilize all actors for sustainable\\ndevelopment in a renewed partnership, in conformity\\nwith the commitments made at Doha, Monterrey and\\nJohannesburg. The time has come to strengthen\\nconcrete cooperation to permit access by all to basic\\nresources such as water and energy, to basic social\\nservices such as education and health, and to food\\nsecurity. Let us also call for the ratification and full\\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol on climate\\nchange.\\nLet us establish true global governance of\\nsustainable development and give it the necessary\\ncoherence. France proposes the creation of an\\neconomic and social security council and of a world\\nenvironmental organization to give all countries \\nespecially those of the South  the possibility of\\nmaking their voices heard on those issues.\\nFinally, let us fully exercise our responsibility to\\ndefend and promote human rights. These are universal.\\nProgress, often fragile, must be encouraged. Violations,\\noften so numerous, must be punished.\\nLet us strengthen the authority and the\\nuniversality of the International Criminal Court to\\nenable it to ensure that the most serious crimes at the\\ninternational level do not go unpunished. This new tool\\nis essential to build a more just and democratic world\\nwhere the principle of responsibility is fully respected.\\nThrough ambitious conventions, let us provide\\nbetter protection, as we did for children, for the\\ndisabled and for the victims of forced disappearance\\nand torture. Let us fight against corruption. Let us\\ncommit ourselves to the negotiation of a universal\\nconvention against human cloning for reproductive\\npurposes, as proposed by France and Germany.\\nYes, the principle of collective responsibility is at\\nthe heart of the international system. It is at the heart of\\nUnited Nations action. In order to play its full role, the\\nOrganization must pursue its reforms. In particular, we\\nmust increase the representativity of the Security\\nCouncil by enlarging both categories of membership.\\nFrance supports the aspirations of Germany, Japan and\\nIndia in particular.\\nThe United Nations is the keystone of the world\\norder. The generous and strong ideas that presided over\\nits birth, just after a world conflict that pushed the\\nlimits of barbarism to the unspeakable, retain all their\\ncurrency. The contemporary world is complex,\\nconfusing and unpredictable. It is urgent that we forge\\namong nations a new alliance, a community of destiny.\\nThat is our future; that is our chance. Through our\\nactions, let us respond to the expectations of the\\nworld's peoples.\", \"\\ufeffSome\\n50 years ago my predecessor Paul-Henri Spaak said\\nbefore the Assembly, in a phrase that stands out in our\\nminds, “We are afraid”. At that time, totalitarianism\\nthreatened democratic freedoms and our open society\\nwas in danger. Fortunately, political and diplomatic\\ndialogue gradually won out over confrontation, mutual\\nthreats and force. The advent of a freer world, more\\nunited and more respectful of everyone is finally within\\nour grasp. After September 2001, all democratic forces\\nthroughout the world felt a moment of fear, terror,\\nconfusion and horror at the barbaric violence that\\nsmashed their strongest beliefs into pieces. That\\nirrational hatred threatened the same democratic\\nvalues, fundamental freedoms and humanistic world\\noutlook.\\nThe free world came together with a sense of\\nsolidarity, compassion and survival. A coalition against\\nthat vile crime stood side by side with the people of the\\nUnited States. We felt it was our duty; we felt that their\\nsuffering was our suffering and that their cause was\\nalso our cause. We could not permit there to be any\\ndoubt in the minds of the enemies of our shared values;\\nwe could not leave any scope for those who sought to\\nbreak the promise of a world of justice, progress and\\npeace.\\nToday we must move beyond fear. Our response\\nmust be guided by clear-minded analysis and rational\\naction. The enemy is faceless but is not everywhere.\\nWe all are now constantly vigilant, but must not reach\\nthe point of being unable to look one another in the eye\\nwithout mistrust or suspicion. We are in an infinitely\\ngreat majority; only an infinitesimal minority is against\\nus. We cannot simply reduce the entire world to a\\nbattlefield. We cannot simply make a division between\\ngood and evil. To build a wall would be to fall into the\\ntrap of those who openly display their hate and\\nintolerance. Instead, more than ever we must realize\\nthat the source of wealth and hope in the world is\\nprecisely its great diversity and pluralism.\\nThe struggle against terrorism must, of course, be\\nbased on effective methods with no room for laxity. I\\nwant to make this point very strongly: fighting\\nterrorism must not lead us to distort the nature of\\ndemocratic tolerant life or respect for the rule of law.\\nPreserving our concept of a pluralist, open and tolerant\\nsociety must be our goal. We cannot be misled or\\naccept distortions of our firm belief in the fundamental\\nhuman rights and the rights of peoples. Combating\\nterrorism also means, above all, that we must defend\\nthe fundamental rights and legal protections of every\\nman and woman. We have a humanist conviction and\\nwe must defend it, because otherwise we would be\\nceding victory to the terrorists. It would also be a\\n2\\n\\nmistake to believe that the fight against terrorism can\\nbe won by military means alone. Military means are\\nadmittedly necessary, but are not themselves enough to\\nput an end to this horrible phenomenon.\\nThere is absolutely nothing that can justify\\nterrorism. No cause can justify terror. I categorically\\nand definitively reject the idea that we have to look to\\nthe inequities of the world for the source of this\\nperversion of the mind and soul. In my view, that\\nwould mitigate this abominable act. The origin of the\\nattack cannot be found there. However, we also know\\nthat misery, injustice, poverty, exclusion and\\nhumiliation create fertile ground for extremism,\\nintolerance and hatred to flourish by taking advantage\\nof the hopelessness and suffering of those left behind\\nby a society too quickly satisfied by its clear\\nconscience.\\nWhy should we deny it? As our Prime Minister\\nGuy Verhofstadt has said, in less than a year we have\\nfocused at least four times on the challenges facing the\\nworld: at Doha, Monterrey, Rome and Johannesburg.\\nThe elimination of poverty, debt reduction and\\nliberalization of international trade as a factor for\\ndevelopment are all questions that have been\\nrepeatedly discussed. We all come to the same\\nconclusions. We identify the same causes. I am certain\\nthat we all know the solutions that must be applied.\\nWith such unanimity, it should be easy to put an\\nend to inequality. It should be easy to bring together a\\nworld which for too long has been cut in two, a world\\nthat generates tensions and frustrations. There cannot\\nand should not be a superficial division at the margin\\nof our wealth. We need a loftier conception of\\ncooperation, one that derives not from paternalism but\\nrather from partnership and mutual respect.\\nPutting an end to inequality and forging a new\\nsolidarity is the way to ensure sustainable development\\nfor future generations. At each of our summits, the rich\\nworld has raised the hopes of the millions of indigent\\npeople who are searching for a glimmer of light in the\\ndarkness. However, each time, at the end of these grand\\nmeetings, when the speeches are over, when those who\\nadvocate on behalf of the poor have stopped their\\nritualistic pleadings, poverty remains in place. One gets\\nthe impression that we have offered those who\\nexpected so much of us only empty rhetoric and\\nposturing.\\nThe Millennium Goals must become a benchmark\\nfor all the work of the United Nations and for that of\\neach of its Member States. We have to translate them\\ninto financial tools and into access to markets and\\ntechnology. At Monterrey, my country pledged to reach\\nthe target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for\\ndevelopment cooperation by 2010. We have offered,\\nfurthermore, new initiatives on the debt burden.\\nI also attach paramount importance to follow-up\\nof the Durban Conference against racism, and to the\\nimplementation of the Durban Programme of Action.\\nCombating racism, discrimination and intolerance is\\nabsolutely essential for the millions of human beings\\nwho have often silently suffered from infringements on\\ntheir dignity. I stress the historic importance of the\\nagreement on the origins and causes of racism. It forms\\nthe basis of a new partnership. Unless we recognize\\npast injustices, we will not have a solid basis for future\\nefforts.\\nAnother challenge that we wish to address is to\\nattain absolute gender equality. This is absolutely\\nessential in a civilization of progress, in which our\\nideals of democracy and humanism are realized. The\\nSecretary-General and his team, including his Deputy,\\nLouise Fréchette, can count on my country's\\ncommitment and support for all the reforms under way.\\nWe must revitalize the General Assembly, continue the\\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council,\\nexpand the Security Council and carry out\\norganizational reforms. I know that the United Nations\\nwill take up these challenges.\\nThe outstanding and far-sighted speech made by\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan rightly, skilfully and\\nresolutely reminded us what, in the final analysis, is the\\nmeaning of the world government and parliament. He\\nmade his statement very convincingly and intelligently.\\nWe share his view on reshaping our Organization so\\nthat it can live up to our ambitions.\\nMy country was at the forefront of combating\\nimpunity for the most serious crimes and for the rapid\\ndevelopment of a true international criminal justice.\\nThat is why we continue to support the\\ninternationalization of the Rome Statute, and why we\\nare resolved to preserve its integrity. Admittedly, we\\nknow that the dialogue is never easy when law interacts\\nwith politics, but we are convinced that in the long-\\nterm, nothing will block society's right to demand\\njustice when the most serious crimes against\\n3\\n\\nfundamental values are committed. States have primary\\nresponsibility for prosecuting the crimes covered in the\\nStatute of the Court. We urge the world community,\\nincluding the most powerful among us, to give the\\nCourt credibility and resources commensurate with its\\nlofty mission.\\nConflict prevention is one of my country's\\nforeign policy priorities. We are engaged concretely in\\npreventive diplomacy, particularly in Central Africa,\\nwhere Belgium is proactively supportive of the Lusaka\\nand Arusha peace processes. Belgium actively\\nadvocates this approach within the European Union.\\nBelgium is seeking to make this concept of conflict\\nprevention, conflict management and post-conflict\\nsupport an essential part of international doctrine. We\\nneed standing monitoring and warning mechanisms to\\nalert us in time to crises. Such mechanisms could spare\\nthe lives of many people. For similar reasons, we need\\nto develop a real strategy against the illegal financing\\nof conflicts and the related illegal trade in natural\\nresources. The sordid exploitation of such resources —\\nfor instance, conflict diamonds — too often contributes\\nto finance or at least prolong regional tragedies such as\\ncivil wars and inter-ethnic conflicts.\\nTo face this challenge, a credible international\\nmonitoring system, based on common standards, has to\\nbe established. Substantial improvements must be\\nmade in the functioning of the various sanctions\\ncommittees, and we believe that a single monitoring\\nbody, with a long-term mandate, should be set up.\\nAfrica is at the centre of our concerns, but also of\\nour hopes. The creation of the African Union during\\nthe Durban summit of the Organization of African\\nUnity, along with the dynamic of the New Partnership\\nfor Africa's Development (NEPAD), are major steps\\nforward taken in recent months. The strengthening of\\ndemocracy and the recent successful elections in Africa\\nare an encouraging sign. The prospects for Africa also\\ninclude regional integration of African countries,\\nwhich we encourage. We can see some positive but still\\nfragile signs with regard to reconciliation in countries\\nthat have been too long devastated by conflicts, such as\\nthe Great Lakes region, Angola and the Sudan.\\nFurther efforts have been made this year to find a\\nsolution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of\\nthe Congo. The inter-Congolese dialogue has led, first,\\nto the signing of a partial agreement at Sun City, which\\ncreated a dynamic of reconciliation, thanks to the\\nefforts of South Africa, to which I pay tribute here. The\\nPretoria Agreement addresses the main causes of the\\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: its\\nterritorial integrity and the security concerns of\\nRwanda. The United Nations Organization Mission in\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has a crucial\\npart to play in ensuring implementation of the\\nAgreement, with its operation to disarm and demobilize\\nthe armed groups.\\nI urge Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of\\nthe Congo to take advantage of this opportunity to\\nrestore to their peoples the peace and prosperity they\\ndeserve. I would also like to pay tribute to the Special\\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Niasse, for\\nbringing all the Congolese parties to the negotiating\\ntable with a view to arriving at a democratic, inclusive\\nagreement.\\nThrough the many meetings I have attended in the\\nregion, I have become acquainted with Congolese\\npolitical figures. I know that they have the will, the\\nauthority, the competence and the grasp of history to\\nrealize the dream of peace and prosperity of a\\npopulation which has suffered for too long.\\nI should like also to pay tribute to the South\\nAfrican and Tanzanian mediation in the context of\\nnegotiations for a ceasefire in Burundi. Despite the\\nprogress made, there has been a resumption of violence\\nthat could undermine the gains recorded in the Arusha\\nprocess — so ably facilitated by the political and moral\\nauthority of President Nelson Mandela. I would also\\nurgently appeal to all international partners to consider\\nwhich concrete steps should be taken to help Burundi\\nemerge from its political, economic and social crisis.\\nThe difficulties prevailing in this area are without a\\ndoubt complicating the political solution.\\nAnother area in need of structural stability is the\\nMiddle East. Men, women, mothers, fathers, children\\nall are suffering on a daily basis from the violence, and\\nfor this reason we must reaffirm those principles that\\nwill enable us to find a lasting and equitable solution:\\nland for peace, a viable Palestinian State and security\\nfor Israel. Rather than going beyond the gains made\\nthrough Oslo and Madrid, we should enshrine and\\nreconfirm them by translating them into reality. This is\\nwhat the European Union has sought to do by drawing\\nup a road map setting out the actions to be taken by the\\nparties concerned with a view to achieving a\\ncomprehensive and lasting solution.\\n4\\n\\nLastly, let me ask a question that I think is of\\nglobal significance. The question of Iraq is a challenge\\nto all of us, because it involves questions at several\\ndifferent levels: the need to eliminate a major threat to\\nthe international community; the need to ensure the\\ncredibility of our Organization; the need to determine\\nwhether a country has weapons of mass destruction that\\ncan bring death to millions of people; the need to\\ndetermine if a country is failing to meet its obligations\\nto the United Nations; and the need to know if a\\npreventive unilateral military action is or is not a\\ndoctrinal problem under international law.\\nAll of these questions are core issues with respect\\nto our Organization, its missions and its individual and\\ncollective political responsibilities.\\nI wish to recall that each and every one of us, in\\nsigning the Charter of the United Nations, solemnly\\nundertook to comply with that Charter. Therefore, on\\nbehalf of my country and of its citizens, I wish to make\\na clear appeal to Iraq. I formally and solemnly ask the\\nIraqi authorities to implement urgently and\\nunconditionally the resolutions adopted by the United\\nNations. Respect for our Organization and respect for\\nwhat we are, collectively and individually, is the only\\nway of avoiding recourse to force. I ask the Iraqi\\nauthorities to seize this last opportunity.\\nAll of these challenges require a united,\\nmultilateral reaction in a spirit of solidarity. The world\\nis a village now, but too often we are rather narrow-\\nminded and do not listen to one another. Sometimes the\\nother is seen as a stranger or even an intruder. Human\\ncivilizations must learn more about one another in\\norder to live together in harmony.\\nThe citizens of the world have different\\nperspectives on life, on religion, on the way they\\norganize their society, on the past and the future. But\\nthey all dream of justice, happiness and equality. Often\\nthey dream the same dream, but the path to\\nimplementing that dream sometimes varies. Respecting\\nothers even though they are different will help us move\\ntowards a more harmonious world. This is what we, as\\npolitical leaders, have a responsibility to do, in order to\\nbroaden day after day the common area of the values\\nthat we share.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffThe current Chairman of the European Union,\\nMr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has already had an\\nopportunity to state to the Assembly the priorities and\\npositions of the European Union. Luxembourg, through\\nits commitment on a day-to-day basis, reaffirms its\\ndedication to multilateral cooperation and to the work\\nof this universal Organization.\\nPresident Kavan, you assumed your important\\npost through a new procedure designed to revitalize the\\nwork of the General Assembly and intensify its impact.\\nI am sure that under your guidance we will achieve\\nother significant successes.\\nMr. Han Seung-soo guided the work of the\\nprevious session during a period when the international\\nsituation was difficult and beset by serious problems.\\nThanks to his extensive experience and his\\nunderstanding of international issues, a calm and\\nfraternal message of cooperation and concerted action\\nresulted from our debates. We all are deeply grateful to\\nhim for that.\\n4\\n\\nOur Organization also has the advantage of\\nhaving a Secretary-General whose humanism and\\noutstanding diplomatic skills are universally\\nacknowledged. He has begun his second term with his\\ncharacteristic dynamism, which we all admire.\\nWe wholeheartedly support the Secretary-General\\nin the discharge of his important mission. There is no\\ndoubt that multilateralism and the support of the United\\nNations system for it have their own particular\\ndynamic. We are counting on him to guide the\\nOrganization in accordance with the guidelines set out\\nin the important statement he made last Thursday.\\nRegarding Iraq, we believe that the international\\ncommunity must continue to work through the United\\nNations, which is charged with the maintenance of\\ninternational peace and security. Iraq must provide\\nunconditional and unimpeded access to the inspectors\\nas well as the necessary cooperation. It must fulfil its\\nobligations immediately. We are determined to support\\nthe efforts of the United Nations to achieve that goal.\\nInternational law was strengthened considerably\\nwith the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the\\nInternational Criminal Court on 1 July last. This\\nrepresents a major step forward in the process of the\\npromotion of the rule of law and in the fight against\\nimpunity. This young institution must receive our full\\nsupport. Indeed, it represents a guarantee in terms of\\nthe desire for protection, which is so deeply rooted in\\neach of us. The broadest possible ratification of the\\nStatute of the Court must remain a high-priority\\nobjective of the international community. The\\nEuropean Union is actively working to that end to\\nensure that the Court is genuinely universal in nature.\\nIn the same multilateral context, the\\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\\nDevelopment has just concluded with the observation\\nthat our planet's natural reserves and resources are\\nlimited and that only solidarity can reconcile the\\nlegitimacy of development and the preservation of an\\nenvironment that respects life. It is humankind's\\nresponsibility to achieve a balance in these two cases.\\nThe Summit charted a course through the Plan of\\nImplementation, which sets out objectives and\\ntimetables. Some may feel that they are not ambitious\\nenough, but they certainly can guide us. We need to\\nimplement this plan, and here new partnerships\\nbetween the United Nations, Governments, companies\\nand civil society are an important tool. Governments,\\nhowever, still must shoulder all of their\\nresponsibilities.\\nIn Doha, the World Trade Organization decided to\\nlink the opening of markets and technical assistance to\\ndevelopment. In Monterrey, a global consensus\\nemerged regarding financing for development. In the\\nwake of Johannesburg, there is a need now to create\\nsynergetic relationships between public assistance,\\nsupport from companies, local resources and the\\ncommitment of non-governmental organizations.\\nPoverty, pollution, overexploitation and, unfortunately,\\nviolence, too, will continue for a long time to fuel\\npessimism.\\nHowever, we are encouraged to note that\\ndemocracy and good governance are concepts and\\npractices that are moving forward and that are\\nincreasingly broadly accepted. In this context, I should\\nlike to pay tribute to the young African Union, which\\nspecifically included among its objectives the\\nadvancement of the principles of democracy and its\\ncorollary, the protection of human rights.\\nHuman rights, democracy, development and\\nsecurity are closely linked. The Council of Europe,\\nwhose principal mission is the championing of human\\nrights, pluralist democracy and the rule of law, has, like\\nthe United Nations, had to face an tremendous\\nchallenge following the events of 11 September. Like\\nthis universal Organization, the Council of Europe,\\nwhose chairmanship Luxembourg has held since\\nMay — its tenure is for a six-month period — has\\ntaken a series of specific measures in the international\\ncampaign against terrorism.\\nIn addition to advancing the process of the\\nsigning and ratification of international instruments,\\nthe Council has devised guidelines for an international\\ncampaign that includes full respect for human rights.\\nIndeed, when security is threatened, respect for human\\nrights becomes all the more important. As statesmen, it\\nis our obligation to prevent anti-terrorist legislation\\nfrom infringing on, or even destroying, democracy in\\nits attempt to champion the fundamental values of\\nfreedom and to safeguard human rights.\\nThe events of 11 September provided a new\\nimpetus, as we all are well aware, to cooperation\\nbetween institutional partners and, above all,\\nemphasized the need to pursue dialogue between\\ncultures and religions and to step up the process of\\nreflection on civilizations in order to promote tolerance\\n5\\n\\nand universal respect for human rights when we are\\nfaced with barbarism. Like the United Nations and the\\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\\nOrganization, the Council of Europe is committed to\\nthat policy.\\nCoordination and complementarity between\\nregional and international organizations are, moreover,\\namong those priorities that Luxembourg has set for its\\nchairmanship. It might thus be useful to establish links\\nhere with the important centres of the Council\\nof Europe, namely the European Court of Human\\nRights — a unique mechanism for the protection of\\nhuman rights; the European Commission against\\nRacism and Intolerance; and, finally, the Committee for\\nthe Prevention of Torture. It is indeed my hope that the\\nimportant work on norms and standards carried out by\\nthe Committee at the European level will one day be\\nimplemented at the international level, and that the\\nOptional Protocol to the United Nations Convention\\nagainst Torture — a Protocol that the Assembly will\\nsoon be called on to endorse — will enjoy the same\\nsuccess as its European predecessor. The establishment\\nof the rule of law for all of us is an objective for which\\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary\\nRobinson worked tirelessly. She deserves our gratitude\\nfor her courage and her contribution to this vital cause.\\nHer successor, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, can also\\ncount on our full cooperation and support.\\nThe special session of the General Assembly on\\nthe rights of children in May 2002 allowed us, once\\nagain, to condemn that indifference which kills and\\ncauses great suffering to millions of disadvantaged and\\ndefenceless individuals. While the Convention on the\\nRights of the Child has made it possible to specifically\\nimprove the lives of countless individuals, work must\\nbe stepped up and expanded in order to guarantee that\\nthere will be a real difference for generations to come.\\nWe view action in favour of women, which falls\\nunder the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\\nof Discrimination against Women, in the same context.\\nLuxembourg would like to reaffirm its dedication to the\\nsignificant work carried out by the United Nations\\nfunds and agencies in these areas. In particular I would\\nlike to mention the United Nations Children's Fund\\n(UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA),\\nUnited Nations Development Fund for Women\\n(UNIFEM) and the United Nations Development\\nProgramme (UNDP). International action for\\nreproductive health is at the crux of their programmes\\nand today it remains indispensable. It requires firm\\nsupport and the necessary budgetary resources. This is\\nwhy Luxembourg firmly supports the efforts of\\nUNFPA.\\nReducing funding for women in difficulty is\\ntotally unjust and considerably increases the suffering\\nof these individuals. To be sure, the work of those\\ndedicated persons who inspire these programmes —\\nincluding quite a few non-governmental\\norganizations — will not come to an end any more than\\nthe labours of Sisyphus. But, are we not all aware of\\nthe progress which has been made possible in the daily\\nlife of individuals, groups and peoples, progress made\\nthrough institutions which have been carefully\\nconceived, democratically established, well managed,\\nwhich in addition benefit from the moral authority\\nprovided them by the United Nations?\\nBearing in mind the destiny of the individuals\\nwho are threatened here, international officials must be\\nprovided with the means to detect at an early stage any\\npossible violation of peace and international security. A\\nheightened awareness of our responsibility to provide\\nfor the protection of civilian populations is in fact\\nnecessary to allow for preventive action and, in\\nparticular, for maintaining peace.\\nAs has been rightly noted by the Secretary-\\nGeneral, such preventive action should be done by\\nstrengthening the capacity of operational and structural\\nprevention on all levels: local as well as national,\\nregional and international, bilateral and multilateral.\\nIncreased interaction between all these levels is\\nrequired so as to replace a culture of reaction by a\\ngenuine culture of prevention. The importance of\\ninvesting in conflict prevention strategies, which may\\nonly yield fruit much later, is not always obvious. Such\\na choice requires a strong will of commitment by all of\\nits players.\\nFor its part, our universal Organization, through\\nthe Security Council and other bodies of the United\\nNations system, is dedicated to defining an outline of\\npossible international action for prevention to make it\\nmore systematic and effective. The pivotal role of the\\nUnited Nations and its authority are essential to\\nachieve this end. It will be up to the fifty-seventh\\nsession of the General Assembly to deal with this\\nquestion as well.\\nIncreasingly, the need to focus attention on the\\ndestinies and tragedies experienced by victims and\\n6\\n\\nreact to the fact that conflicts today deliberately and\\nincreasingly claim victims among the civilian\\npopulation can be given priority status, because\\ninternational relations today are no longer hampered by\\nthe ideological battles of yesterday. However,\\nantagonisms have not disappeared and may even cloak\\nthemselves in new forms. We need to remain vigilant.\\nOne year ago, the international community was\\ndeeply shaken by the terrorist attacks of 11 September\\n2001 against the civilian populations of New York,\\nWashington and Pennsylvania. A few days ago we\\nvisited Ground Zero as a sign of our grief and to\\nreaffirm our determination to act against barbarity.\\nWhile we can indeed note that the efforts made since\\nthat tragic day to combat international terrorism have\\nachieved some specific results, this should not,\\nhowever, prompt us to let down our guard. Other\\ntragedies are still open wounds, such as the particularly\\nobvious case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\nThe Middle East, since Oslo, has seen\\nextraordinary efforts at mediation. Faced with violence\\nand hate, non-intervention and keeping one's distance\\nare not real options. Efforts are continuing, aimed at\\ncreating conditions for new negotiations that might\\nmake it possible to conclude the work that has been\\nlanguishing since Taba. The European Union is\\nactively participating in this process and is making\\nefforts, through new initiatives of the Danish\\npresidency, to once again put the political context at\\nthe heart of our concerns. The tireless efforts of the\\ninternational community are required to emphasize the\\nneed for moderation. Moderates, on whatever side,\\nhave no easy task when faced with extremism. But we\\nsupport them. Peace requires all of us, in fact, to be\\ninternally split, as noted by Mr. Shlomo Ben Ami, but,\\nI would add, it will also include reconciliation. And\\nthis must be prepared with the new external partner and\\nalso with those reluctant domestic forces, which must\\nbe reintegrated into the peace process.\\nDevelopments in Sri Lanka, moreover,\\ndemonstrate that hope can win the day over violence.\\nIn the case of Timor-Leste, it is also thanks to the\\nUnited Nations that this hope has been fulfilled. And in\\nAfrica, several hotbeds of tension have been eased in\\n2002, in Angola, in the Democratic Republic of the\\nCongo and in Burundi in particular. The effort made by\\nthe international community in Afghanistan must, as\\nwe know, be continued over time to insure the\\nestablishment and functioning of a stable democratic\\nand fully representative State. The process of\\nnormalization under way in the Balkans deserves\\nsimilar attention.\\nAfter some 160 years of existence as an\\nindependent State, Luxembourg is fully aware of the\\nlimits inherent in its size and the means available to it.\\nIn foreign policy we are acting with the firm conviction\\nthat the multilateral system of cooperation is one which\\nprovides a place and a role for everyone. In an\\ninterdependent world, we all must shoulder our\\nresponsibilities and make our contribution. And that is\\nthe basis of our commitment to the universal\\nOrganization, as it is the basis of our action to support\\ndevelopment in the world. This is why we wish to raise\\nour official development assistance to 1 per cent of\\nGNP, after having been, in 2001, in the position to go\\nbeyond the threshold of 0.7 per cent recommended by\\nthe United Nations.\\nOur Organization brings together the international\\ncommunity. It is the unique forum which allows for\\nexchanges and allows us to chart the path for totally\\nnew solutions. And I am gratified to see that during\\nthis session there are two new Members here in 2002,\\nnamely Switzerland and Timor-Leste. We congratulate\\nthem on having taken this decision and we extend a\\nwarm welcome to them to our Assembly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffSergio\\nVieira de Mello was the pride of the United Nations.\\nMurdered on 19 August along with his colleagues, he\\nwill remain in our memories. Let us dedicate this\\nsession to that great servant of the world and of peace.\\nThe United Nations has just emerged from one of\\nthe most serious challenges in its history. Respect for\\nthe Charter and the use of force were at the heart of the\\ndebate. The war, which was launched without the\\nSecurity Council's authorization, has undermined the\\nmultilateral system.\\nHaving come to terms with that crisis, our\\nOrganization can now continue to move forward; for it\\nis above all in this forum   the melting pot of the\\ninternational order   that we must exercise our\\nresponsibilities to the world of today as well as to\\nfuture generations.\\nIn an open world no one can live in isolation, no\\none can act alone in the name of all and no one can\\naccept the anarchy of a society without rules. There is\\nno alternative to the United Nations. But in order to\\nmeet today's challenges, this fundamental choice,\\nexpressed by the Charter, requires a far-reaching\\nreform of our Organization.\\nMultilateralism is crucial, because it ensures the\\nparticipation of all in the management of world affairs.\\nIt is a guarantee of legitimacy and democracy,\\nespecially when decisions must be made with respect to\\nthe use of force or to the laying down of universal\\nnorms.\\n15\\n\\nMultilateralism is effective. In Monterrey and\\nJohannesburg, it allowed us to transcend North-South\\nconfrontation and to open the way to promising\\npartnerships, in particular with the African continent.\\nMultilateralism is modern, because it alone makes\\nit possible to comprehend contemporary problems\\nglobally and in all of their complexity.\\nFirst, let me touch on the settlement of conflicts\\nthat threaten international peace and security.\\nIn Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis,\\nwho must have sole responsibility for their destiny, is\\nessential for stability and reconstruction. It is up to the\\nUnited Nations to lend its legitimacy to that process. It\\nis also up to the United Nations to assist with the\\ngradual transfer of administrative and economic\\nresponsibilities to the Iraqi institutions, according to a\\nrealistic timetable, and to help the Iraqis draft a\\nconstitution and hold general elections.\\nFinally, it is up to the United Nations to entrust a\\nmandate to a multinational force, commanded,\\nnaturally, by the main troop contributor   that is, the\\nUnited States   in order to ensure the security of Iraq\\nand of all those helping to rebuild the country.\\nThus the international community and the Iraqi\\npeople, united around a common project, will together\\nput an end to the tragic decades of that great country's\\nhistory.\\nIn the Middle East, ravaged by despair and\\nhatred, only strong political will on both sides to\\nimplement the law as stipulated by the United Nations\\ncan pave the way for a just and lasting solution.\\nThe international community must restore a\\ndynamic for peace. It must involve itself in the\\nimplementation of the road map. That should be the\\nobjective of the upcoming meeting of the Quartet, to be\\nheld at the ministerial level. France believes that the\\nidea of a monitoring mechanism is as relevant as ever,\\nand that the convening of an international conference is\\na goal to be attained as quickly as possible.\\nGiven the present tense situation, France calls on\\nthe parties not to succumb to the temptation of a test of\\nstrength and of a futile radicalization.\\nAnother major challenge is the fight against\\ninternational terrorism. This fight is well under way,\\nunder the auspices of the Security Council and within\\nthe context of our treaties. The horror of 11 September\\ncemented our common resolve. This threat strikes at\\nthe very heart of our democracies and our societies. We\\nare using force to combat terrorism, but that is not\\nenough. It will re-emerge again and again if we allow\\nextremism and fanaticism to flourish   if we fail to\\nrealize that it seeks justification in the world's\\nunresolved conflicts and economic and social\\nimbalances.\\nGiven the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction, we reject the policy of fait accompli. We\\nmust stand united to guarantee the universality of\\ntreaties and the effectiveness of non-proliferation\\nregimes. In order to ensure compliance, we must also\\ndevelop our means of action. France has proposed the\\ncreation of a permanent corps of inspectors under the\\nauthority of the Security Council. Let us give fresh\\nimpetus to this policy. Let us convene a summit\\nmeeting of the Security Council to outline a true plan\\nof action of the United Nations against proliferation.\\nAt this time, let us demand that North Korea\\ncompletely, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle its\\nmilitary programme. Let us demand that Iran sign and\\nimplement, unconditionally and without delay, a\\nstrengthened nuclear safeguards agreement with the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\\nSustainable development poses yet another\\nchallenge, because half of humankind is living in\\nconditions of insecurity or extreme poverty. Will we be\\nable to globalize solidarity, as our peoples demand, in\\nresponse to the inevitable globalization of the\\neconomy?\\nWe agree on the objectives. We are bound by the\\nMillennium Goals. But, in order to attain those goals,\\nstrong political impetus remains necessary. I propose\\nthat heads of State and Government meet in New York\\nin 2005 for a preliminary progress review. I hope that\\nthis session of the General Assembly will confirm the\\ndetermination of States to overcome the failure of\\nCancun and to ensure the success of the Doha\\nDevelopment Round.\\nIn order to carry out the missions entrusted to it\\nand to remedy its blatant shortcomings, the United\\nNations must evolve. Three watchwords, I believe,\\nmust guide us: democracy, authority, effectiveness.\\nThanks to the Secretary-General, progress has been\\nmade, and new avenues are opening up. It is now up to\\nStates to move forward without further ado and to put\\n16\\n\\nan end to the adverse consequences of the stalemate\\nover reforms.\\nThe United Nations is suffering from the current\\nweakness of the General Assembly. And yet, it is here\\nthat a debate should be organized and a consensus\\ncrafted regarding solutions to major problems. A\\nculture of confrontation must give way to a culture of\\naction aimed at achieving our common goals, which we\\nshould determine together.\\nThe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\\npeace and security rests with the Security Council. It is\\ntherefore essential to its legitimacy that its composition\\nreflect the state of the world. It must be expanded to\\ninclude new permanent members, because the presence\\nof major countries is necessary. France, naturally, is\\nthinking of Germany and of Japan, but also of some\\nleading countries of Asia, Africa and America. We also\\nneed new elected members, to make the Council even\\nmore representative. With the decisive impetus of the\\nfive permanent members, we all need to resume\\ndiscussions, mindful of the general interest.\\nSuch reform should be accompanied by a\\nstrengthening of the Council's authority. It is the\\nCouncil that should set the bounds with respect to the\\nuse of force. No one can claim the right to use force\\nunilaterally and preventively. Conversely, in the face of\\nmounting threats, States must be assured that the\\nCouncil has at its disposal the appropriate means of\\nevaluation and of collective action, and that it has the\\nwill to act.\\nWe all are very committed to the sovereignty of\\nStates. But its scope can and should be limited in the\\ncase of serious violations of human rights and of\\nhumanitarian law. The Security Council is taking steps\\nin that direction, and France supports this development.\\nMeanwhile, crimes against humanity are being\\nsuppressed more effectively with the establishment of\\nthe International Criminal Court, whose jurisdiction is\\nuniversal. This historic step forward must be\\naccompanied by a strengthening of the Office of the\\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, under a\\ncommission equipped to discharge its duties and its\\nmission.\\nWe now realize that globalization demands\\nstronger economic, social and environmental\\ngovernance. To that end, France proposes the creation\\nof a new political forum representative of the present\\neconomic state of today's world in all its diversity.\\nThat council would be responsible for providing the\\nnecessary impetus to international institutions, for\\nimproving their coordination and for anticipating and\\ntackling global problems more effectively.\\nEffectiveness also depends on increased financial\\nresources. France calls for two changes.\\nFirst, the trend towards increasing voluntary\\ncontributions at the expense of mandatory\\ncontributions must be reversed. Failing that, we will\\nend up with a pick-and-choose United Nations, which\\nis an outdated vision and a harmful one.\\nSecondly, we need to make progress in\\nmobilizing funds for development and development\\nassistance. France wants to meet the official\\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent by the\\nyear 2012. But this effort, together with that of the\\nEuropean Union, will obviously not suffice to release\\nthe necessary funds needed to finance the Millennium\\nGoals each year. France therefore supports the\\ninnovative concept of an international financial facility.\\nI would also like us to give pragmatic, speedy\\nconsideration to international solidarity levies, a kind\\nof tax on the wealth generated by globalization and\\ngiven over to development.\\nTo advance on these issues, I completely approve\\nof the Secretary-General's intention to gather around\\nhim a committee of independent wise men and women\\nresponsible for submitting proposals.\\nAgainst the risk of a world without order\\ndelivered up to violence, let us work to establish the\\nrule of international law. Against the injustice and\\nsuffering of a world of widening inequalities   even\\nthough it has never been so rich   let us choose\\nsolidarity. Against the chaos of a world shaken by\\necological disasters, let us call for a sharing of\\nresponsibility around a United Nations environmental\\norganization. Against the barbarity of a world in which\\nfundamental rights are all too often held up to ridicule,\\nwhere the integrity of mankind is under threat, where\\nindigenous peoples   the heirs to an irreplaceable\\nheritage   vanish amid silence and indifference, let us\\nuphold the demands of ethics. Against the peril of a\\nclash of civilizations, finally, let us insist on the equal\\ndignity of cultures, respect for diversity and the value\\nof dialogue.\\n17\\n\\nWith the Charter adopted in the name of the\\nPeoples of the United Nations, the founders proclaimed\\ntheir faith in these ideals. Let us seek to be worthy of\\nthem. Let us establish the United Nations at the heart\\nof this planetary democracy that is so vital in our day\\nand age.\\n\\n\\n\", '\\ufeffI would\\nlike at the outset to extend my sincerest congratulations\\nto you, Sir, on your accession to the presidency of the\\nGeneral Assembly. It comes at a particularly difficult\\ntime, which I might even describe as painful, in the\\nhistory of our Organization.\\nIndeed, the past year has gravely challenged the\\ncapacities of the United Nations to manage the crisis in\\nIraq to its conclusion, a country to which it was\\naccountable. It saw the pre-eminent role for the\\nmaintenance of international peace and security of this\\ninstitution, symbol of multilateralism and stability,\\ncalled into question.\\nYet, it is not our institution’s intrinsic capacity\\nthat is the cause of its powerlessness. It is essentially\\nits Members’ lack of political determination. We\\ncannot elude this vital debate for a peaceful, more\\nharmonious and more just future indefinitely. Sooner or\\nlater, we must answer the essential question: How can\\nwe ensure that all Member States of the United Nations\\nwill be prepared to accept the binding nature of\\nSecurity Council endorsements of military action prior\\nto engaging in it?\\nTo make myself perfectly clear, and to avoid any\\nmisunderstanding, the question that I ask is as follows:\\nWhat reforms need to be made to the Organization’s\\noperations to placate the often-understandable\\napprehension or reticence of those who, because they\\nassume specific political responsibilities, refuse to\\nsubmit their geostrategic options to the rules of our\\nOrganization? As long as we remain unable to answer\\nthat question, we will continue to live in doubt and\\nuncertainty, if not in helplessness. It is not a question\\nof advocating an institutional shake-up of the\\nOrganization; rather debate should enable us to\\novercome the all-too-many misunderstandings that\\nundermine the credibility of our shared instrument, and\\nfrom which we can draw conclusions that will help us\\nto make the Organization’s mechanisms more credible\\nand up to date. The Security Council was founded on\\nthe recognition of the particular responsibility and role\\nof some of our Members, and I fully subscribe to it.\\nBut should we not integrate new perspectives into this\\nstate of affairs, such as the regional dimension, present\\ngeopolitical facts and also new threats?\\nThis is in no way meant to contest the specific\\ninfluence of some of those involved in international\\npeace and security management. Rather, our concerted\\nsupport could help accompany, legitimize and\\nstrengthen their approach and their effectiveness,\\nthanks to the indisputably added value of multilateral\\ndynamics. In many cases, this would avoid taking\\nunnecessary risks and misunderstandings. In that\\nregard, I think that, given its role as a global actor, the\\nEuropean Union greatly deserves a permanent seat on\\nthe Security Council on its own behalf.\\nIt is this conviction that has inspired my country’s\\nposition on the Iraq crisis. But now is not the time to\\ndetermine who was right or who was wrong. All sides\\nclearly had their reasons. One can only respect them\\nfor it.\\nBut it is now necessary to contribute to the re-\\nestablishment of stability and ensure Iraq’s\\nreconstruction. That is the responsibility of us all, for it\\nconcerns a region neighbouring Europe, and we cannot\\ntolerate, if only for the sake of our own security,\\nincreased instability or the persistence of an\\nuncontrolled spiral of violence that feeds resentment\\ntowards the international community, which, as history\\nhas taught us, constitutes the principal breeding ground\\nfor terrorism.\\nIt is thus necessary to stop the violence as quickly\\nas possible. To this end, I share the opinion of the\\nSecretary-General and of many among us. It is\\nnecessary to restore as quickly as possible\\nresponsibility for governing Iraq to the people of Iraq.\\nThe return to sovereignty, under the watchful eye of the\\nUnited Nations and of the international community as a\\nwhole, is capable of providing the salutary shock\\nneeded to reverse the current trend. We must convince\\nthe Iraqi people that national union, the\\nre-establishment of State authority and economic\\nrecovery are accessible and at hand. This of course\\ndoes not imply that the international community should\\ndemobilize. A strong military force in Iraq will still be\\nnecessary for some time to guarantee stability. It is of\\ncourse up to the United States to assume its\\nmanagement. But from now on this presence must not\\nbe regarded as designed to occupy the country, but\\nrather as a way to assist in the reconstruction process\\n34\\n\\nfor the sake of the Iraqi people. The Security Council\\nresolution that is currently under discussion must\\ncreate this prospect so as to insure broad participation\\nby the international community.\\nThe United Nations has a central role to play in\\naccompanying the political reconstruction process in\\nIraq, even if the tragic events of August have shown\\nhow risky and vulnerable that process is. However,\\nsuch a role requires a clear mandate and sufficient\\nmeans.\\nI wish to renew my sincerest condolences to the\\nSecretary-General, to the bereaved families and to\\ncolleagues, and express my high regard and admiration\\nfor all the United Nations staff members for their\\ninvolvement, their selflessness and the sacrifices that\\nthey accept so steadfastly.\\nThe principal security threat is the uncontrollable\\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\\npotential use by some States in breach of minimal\\nethical standards or by certain terrorist movements.\\nThat threat is serious. We must each confront the threat\\ntogether, by shouldering our fair share of the actions\\nundertaken.\\nThe European Union and its member States\\ncurrently possess an essential document which deals\\nwith the European security strategy. It should enable\\nus, as Javier Solana quite recently reminded us in\\nBrussels, to plot a European chart of the challenges\\nfacing this world to better guarantee the effectiveness\\nof our collective security system. Belgium will actively\\nparticipate in this endeavour.\\nFurthermore, we fully share the international\\ncommunity’s concerns about the nuclear programme of\\nNorth Korea. We strongly call upon North Korea to\\nabide by its previous international commitments. We\\nare grateful to China for having offered a useful format\\nfor discussion in this respect.\\nAs for Iran, I trust that through a sustained and\\nconstructive dialogue it will meet the expectations of\\nthe international community and respond to the\\nrequests of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\\nBelgium will continue to participate in a\\ndetermined and proactive way in the international\\nefforts that were initiated two years ago to track down\\nterrorism. In Belgium, there is no sanctuary for\\nterrorism, nor will there ever be. Nevertheless, the fight\\nagainst terrorism should not be used as an abusive\\njustification for actions that would undermine the\\ndemocratic quality and the sacred principles of the rule\\nof law.\\nFurthermore, I am not one of those who believe\\nthat the military option is the exclusive answer,\\nalthough obviously it should not be excluded. Much\\nmore fundamentally, we need to systematically attack\\nthe root causes of a phenomenon that is often rooted in\\nthe feeling of powerlessness or in feelings of real or\\nperceived injustice.\\nFor this reason, Belgium will also continue to\\nsupport, together with its European partners, the action\\nof the Quartet for the re-establishment of peace\\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. To\\nachieve that goal, it is necessary that Palestinians\\ndecide unambiguously to renounce the toleration of\\nblind violence and that Israel, in the same spirit, stop\\nfavouring the use of force.\\nOne has the impression that, as difficulties pile\\nup, we have fallen back into the traps of Oslo: a\\ngradualism of small steps and a too-pronounced\\nreliance on sequencing. The road map prescribes\\nparallel advances on the security, political and\\neconomic paths. From each side, we need to obtain\\nbolder measures and the acceptance of the risks these\\nimply. There is no alternative to the road map. It has\\nnot yet been implemented seriously. We believe it is\\nparticularly urgent to create a credible, on-site\\nverification mechanism.\\nIt is in Africa, particularly in Central Africa, that\\nmy country commits itself in the most determined way\\nto the restoration of peace and stability. We are\\nencouraged by the successful installation of a\\ntransitional Government in Kinshasa that now brings\\ntogether all the parties. Now, State structures have to\\nbe restored and good governance has to be introduced\\nin order to allow for the return of foreign aid and\\ninvestment. The persisting violence in the east of the\\ncountry must end.\\nIn this context, I wish to mention the remarkable\\nefforts by the United Nations Organization Mission in\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). I\\nam particularly happy about the success of Operation\\nArtemis. Apart from restoring security in Bunia, this\\noperation has given MONUC the thrust it needed to be\\nable to face up to the challenges of its new mandate.\\n35\\n\\nNow, priority must be given to the preparation of\\nelections in order to grant the Democratic Republic of\\nthe Congo a new start on a solid basis and to\\nconsolidate its restored territorial integrity. Belgium\\nwill be present at all levels and in every phase of this\\nprocess. But I wish to insist on the fact that the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo needs the\\ndetermined commitment of all the instruments of our\\ncommunity. It would be unforgivable not to forge, here\\nand now, the conditions for a complete stabilization of\\nthe entire region.\\nWe also need to help Rwanda to continue its\\nnational reconciliation efforts, which are indispensable\\nin order to guarantee sustainable stability in that fragile\\ncountry. I am convinced the recent elections will\\ncontribute to this goal.\\nAs for Burundi, the implementation of the Arusha\\nAgreements must continue, and the rebels have to be\\nconvinced that they should join this process. My\\ncountry looks forward to participating actively in the\\nnew action on Burundi decided by the Economic and\\nSocial Council. We hope that will help Burundi to\\nbreak through its isolation within the international\\ncommunity.\\nFinally, my country closely follows the efforts by\\nthe United Nations to reactivate the project for a Great\\nLakes conference, which should seal the re-\\nestablishment of peaceful relations and the\\ndevelopment of cross-border cooperation among the\\ncountries of the region.\\nThe credibility of the United Nations does not\\ndepend only on its willingness and capacity to manage\\ncrises. It also depends on its capacity to respond to the\\nexpectations of men, women and children all over the\\nworld, who are directly or indirectly confronted with\\nimbalances and injustice whose causes and solutions\\nboth are found only at the global level. It is essential to\\nmaster globalization, develop the promises it offers and\\ncorrect its excesses.\\nIt is clear that, in accordance with the analysis of\\nthe Secretary-General, this challenge requires\\nfundamental reflection on the architecture of the major\\ninstruments of development. That demands openness of\\nmind and should not exclude any option from the start.\\nHas not the time come to reinforce the capacity of the\\nUnited Nations to act effectively in this field? I wish to\\nrepeat a question that I raised at the World Trade\\nOrganization Ministerial Conference in Cancún.\\nShould we not, for example, create a real Economic\\nand Social Security Council, which would derive its\\nlegitimacy and efficiency from law and which would\\nhave the same power in the management of economic,\\nsocial and environmental policies as the Security\\nCouncil has on issues of peace? That is my conviction,\\nespecially since those fields form the requisite\\nbackdrop to achieving stability and security.\\nThe Economic and Social Council needs to be\\nreformed to give it a more decisive operational role in\\nthe control of a world organization based on universal\\nprinciples of equity. This goal should lead to broad and\\nbalanced synergies between international organizations\\nsuch as the World Bank, the International Monetary\\nFund, the World Trade Organization and the\\nInternational Labour Organization, which should really\\nbecome instruments of the same project.\\nThe founding principles of such a concept exist\\nalready and are being applied in certain countries, such\\nas in mine. I am referring more specifically to\\nfundamental labour standards such as the freedom of\\nunions, the prohibition of child labour and forced\\nlabour and the right to quality employment, as well as\\nenvironmental obligations, which are vital for\\nsustainable development. I am also thinking of the need\\nto exclude services of general interest from the market\\nsphere.\\nTo conclude, it seems to me that such an ambition\\nwould opportunely translate the tremendous hope\\ngenerated by the Millennium Summit. The Millennium\\nDeclaration clearly defined the goals at our level. I am\\npleased with the decision of the General Assembly to\\nmake the five-year review of the Millennium Summit\\nin 2005 into an important event, which I think should\\nbe a summit of heads of State and Government. That\\nsummit should assess the implementation not only of\\nthe Millennium Goals, but also of the goals of all the\\nmajor United Nations conferences.\\nBut the success of that summit implies going\\nfurther. It should at last boldly lay the foundation for a\\nworld in which inequalities between poor and rich\\ncountries can be filled in a sustainable way. It should\\nnourish, in an irreversible way, the indispensable\\nconfidence the world needs to be safer, more human\\nand more brotherly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\ufeffMs. Lydie Polfer, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\\nfor Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, regrets that she is\\nnot able to speak to the Assembly today and has asked\\nme to do so in her place.\\nThe current President of the European Union, Mr.\\nSilvio Berlusconi, has already presented to the\\nAssembly the priorities and positions of the European\\nUnion, which Luxembourg supports with conviction.\\nThe United Nations remains in mourning\\nfollowing the cowardly and inhuman attack of 19\\nAugust 2003 against United Nations headquarters in\\nBaghdad, which took the lives of 22 persons — most of\\nwhom were United Nations personnel — including that\\nof Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative\\nof the Secretary-General. Today our thoughts are with\\nthose victims, who, day after day, through their work in\\nthe service of the Organization, helped to make the\\nworld a better place.\\nAs was recently noted by the Secretary-General,\\nthat heinous act raises important questions, because it\\nis\\n“a direct challenge to the vision of world\\nsolidarity and of collective security rooted in the\\nCharter and articulated in the Millennium\\nDeclaration”. (A/58/323, chapter I, para. 2)\\nIt is our responsibility, as representatives of the\\nnations of the world, gathered here at the fifty-eighth\\nsession of the General Assembly, to meet this challenge\\nand to try to provide constructive answers that open\\nprospects for the future.\\nA few months ago, the Minister for Foreign\\nAffairs, Ms. Lydie Polfer, presented to the Luxembourg\\nParliament her foreign policy declaration in a context\\ncharacterized by the deep divisions in the international\\ncommunity that marked the international situation at\\nthe beginning of this year. At that time, Ms. Polfer\\nelaborated on these thoughts, which also define the\\noverall approach of the Luxembourg Government to\\nmultilateral cooperation.\\n“During the debates on Iraq, all sides\\nextensively debated the role and the credibility of\\nour shared institutions. Have they shown their\\nlimits? Have they ceased to function? Are they\\nstill adapted to our day and age? Is\\nmultilateralism still relevant today? I would like\\nto give a clear answer to this question. Yes, more\\nthan ever, we need multilateral bodies that allow\\nus to work together so that international law can\\nbe established and respected, with international\\nrules and procedures that ensure respect for\\nhuman rights and that govern the lives of all\\nStates, regardless of their size. This is not just\\nwishful thinking, but something that is in our\\ninterest.\\n“We must not only assist in the development\\nof these institutions, but also participate actively\\nin strengthening them through committed and\\nconstructive cooperation. The United Nations is,\\nof course, the primary forum for such cooperation\\nto take place”.\\nBut while we believe that multilateral cooperation\\nremains the best way of dealing with the many current\\ninternational issues, we must, however, reflect on ways\\nand means of adapting such cooperation to the\\nevolution of our world, with a view to defining a new\\nmultilateralism for the twenty-first century and to\\nrethinking the conditions of a new kind of global\\ngovernance. In this context, the Millennium\\nDeclaration charts a steady course that will enable us to\\nmobilize the international community to take action on\\na number of specific, quantifiable objectives.\\nAmong recent advances, I would like to highlight\\nin particular the achievements registered at the fifty-\\nseventh session of the General Assembly under the\\nleadership of President Kavan; we commend the\\ninnovative work he did during his presidency of the\\nGeneral Assembly. We wish also to stress the process\\nof reflection that was inspired by the Brahimi report on\\npeacekeeping operations.\\nMuch work remains to be done, however. The\\ntwo recent reports of the Secretary-General on the\\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\\nDeclaration and on the strengthening of the United\\nNations provide them with both an analytical\\n20\\n\\nframework and an operational plan of action of vital\\nimportance. We must provide them with concrete\\nfollow-up.\\nThe United Nations must remain the premier\\ninstitution for meeting the challenges facing\\nhumankind and for finding shared solutions. To quote\\nthe expressive words of Kofi Annan,\\n“The challenge ahead is to strengthen our\\ncapacity for collective action and thus forge a\\ncommon destiny in a time of accelerating global\\nchange”. (A/57/387, chapter I, para. 2)\\nWe must reaffirm the status of international law\\nwhile developing it to take account of new situations\\nand contexts. We are doing this successfully in the\\nfields of the protection of human rights, the fight\\nagainst terrorism, the environment, and in other fields.\\nThe inception of the International Criminal Court\\n(ICC) is a major stage, which we welcome. We hope\\nthat it will soon begin work on the full range of its\\nactivities, in accordance with the terms of its Statute.\\nWe appeal to all Members of our Organization to\\naccede to the Rome Statute in order to give the ICC the\\nuniversality that will enable it to fight impunity for the\\ngravest of crimes. We must continue, with\\ndetermination and courage, efforts to reform and\\nrevitalize our institutions. Much has already been done,\\nthanks in particular to the efforts of our Secretary-\\nGeneral regarding the Secretariat, whose structures\\nhave been modernized and whose procedures have\\nbeen rationalized, though work must continue,\\nparticularly in the financial, budgetary and\\nmanagement areas.\\nLast week, the Secretary-General rightly drew our\\nattention to the vital renewal of the intergovernmental\\nbodies of our Organization — be it the Security\\nCouncil, the General Assembly or the Economic and\\nSocial Council. With respect to the General Assembly\\nin particular, our President — whom I wish warmly to\\ncongratulate on his election to his important post —\\nundertook a certain number of initiatives aimed at\\nrevitalizing our annual session, in order to give it once\\nagain the central place it should occupy as the primary\\nvenue for meetings, debates and stock-taking. I wish to\\nassure the President that Luxembourg — which holds a\\nvice-presidency of the General Assembly — will fully\\nsupport his endeavours.\\nThe ability to work with updated methods on a\\nstreamlined agenda that focuses on the real needs of\\nour day seems to us to be a prerequisite for the\\nincreased presence and greater relevance of the General\\nAssembly in international debates.\\nImportant progress has already been made in the\\nareas of peacekeeping and peace-building. The\\npresentation in 2000 of the Brahimi report launched an\\nintensive process of reflection and debate, and led to a\\nnumber of crucial decisions aimed at more effective\\nmanagement of peacekeeping operations. The adoption\\nof Security Council resolution 1327 (2000) and the\\nAssembly’s adoption on 3 July 2003 of resolution\\n57/337, “Prevention of armed conflict”, constituted\\nparticularly significant events, which we welcome, just\\nas we support their practical implementation.\\nWhile the debate has developed considerably,\\npolitically and conceptually, we must emphasize the\\nadmirable work carried out by the United Nations in\\nthe field, in often difficult conditions. It should be\\nrecalled that today our Organization is managing 15\\npeacekeeping operations throughout the world,\\nmobilizing approximately 40,000 Blue Helmets and\\ncivilian staff. We can rightly be proud of this, without\\nbeing complacent. The missions in Timor-Leste,\\nKosovo and Sierra Leone have shown the decisive\\nimpact that the United Nations can have when it has a\\nclear mandate and adequate resources.\\nHere again, much remains to be done. The\\ndifficult situations that persist in countries such as\\nAfghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia and in the Great\\nLakes region, not to mention the “forgotten conflicts”,\\ncontinue to demand greater attention by the\\ninternational community. By contributing to the shared\\neffort, particularly in Kosovo and Afghanistan,\\nLuxembourg has shown its readiness to assume its\\nshare of responsibility in this regard.\\nSpecial attention should be given in the future to\\nthe problem of the transition from intervention in\\nemergencies and crisis situations to the handling of\\npost-conflict contexts. Integrating all dimensions,\\nparticularly the political, humanitarian, security and\\neconomic, in a single approach, perfecting the\\ninstruments and methodologies adapted to this type of\\nchallenge, seems to us to be an urgent and necessary\\ntask.\\nThe Government of Luxembourg is convinced\\nthat the noble task of preserving peace must be based\\n21\\n\\non a broad and complex concept of security. New\\nthreats have been added to the dangers of traditional\\nmilitary confrontation. At the forefront of those threats\\nare terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction.\\nTwo years after the deadly attacks of 11\\nSeptember, which touched the entire world, we can see\\nthat great progress has been made in the fight against\\nterrorism. A firm position of principle and a\\nmultidisciplinary approach remain indispensable in\\norder to combat and stop this widespread and\\ndestructive phenomenon. Luxembourg will play its full\\npart in this effort, which must be pursued tirelessly,\\nwith our Organization playing a major role.\\nThe danger of the proliferation of weapons of\\nmass destruction continues to arouse the legitimate\\nconcern of our peoples. World leaders have a\\nresponsibility to confront this serious threat to peace\\nand security by establishing and strengthening the\\nnecessary international regimes. For its part, the\\nEuropean Union has decided, on the basis of the\\nEuropean Council’s Thessaloniki Declaration, to\\ndevelop a long-term strategy against proliferation, and\\nhas already adopted basic principles and a concrete\\nplan of action to give shape to this strategy.\\nLikewise, international arms limitation and\\nreduction efforts, particularly with regard to small\\narms, must be continued and broadened.\\nBut, given the immediate and tragic urgency of\\nviolent conflicts and terrorist attacks, we must not lose\\nsight of a more structural cause of global instability\\nand insecurity: the persistence of poverty and\\nunderdevelopment. In a world in which every year\\nalmost 15 million children under the age of 5 die of the\\neffects of poverty, we must continue unabated our fight\\nfor development. The Millennium Declaration, the\\nconclusions of the Johannesburg Summit and the\\nMonterrey Consensus have shown us the way and the\\nobjectives to be achieved in order to establish a real\\nglobal partnership for development.\\nThe dimensions of this basic problem are many\\nand interdependent. I shall cite just three.\\nThe first dimension is the fight against\\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, in which\\nLuxembourg is strongly involved and which was quite\\nrightly the focus of attention at the high-level debate\\nthat opened this session of the General Assembly. The\\nsecond is international trade. The failure of the Fifth\\nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in\\nCancún is undeniably a major disappointment. If we\\nwant to achieve a balanced and more just trade system,\\nit is imperative that we resume the dialogue on the\\nobjectives to be achieved and the way to achieve them.\\nThe third dimension is financing for development,\\nwhich, according to the Secretary-General’s report on\\nthe follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\\nSummit, remains “well below the level needed to meet\\nthe Goals” (A/58/323, para. 49), even though we are\\npleased at a recent rise in the volume of official\\ndevelopment assistance. For its part, my country is\\nparticipating in this global solidarity effort by devoting\\nover 0.8 per cent of its gross national product to\\nofficial development assistance, with a view to\\nachieving the target of 1 per cent about midway\\nthrough the decade.\\nWhile development remains the new name of\\npeace, we must not lose sight of other factors of\\ninstability, such as ecological problems, new infectious\\ndiseases, transnational crime and corruption, and,\\nlastly, grave and repeated violations of human rights\\nand threats to democracy and good governance.\\nLet us not forget, in that regard, the wise words of\\nMr. Annan, who has written:\\n“Greater respect for human rights, along with\\ndemocracy and social justice, will, in the long\\nterm, be the most effective prophylactic against\\nterror”. (ibid, para. 76)\\nGiven these multiple threats, defining a\\nprogramme of shared security on a global scale, within\\nmultilateral bodies, is a primary objective. The\\nEuropean Union, an international actor deeply involved\\nin a vast process of enlargement and constitutional\\ndevelopment, has begun the discussion of a strategic\\nconcept of security and defence, which will make a\\nmajor contribution to the international debate in this\\nregard.\\nFor more than a year, international attention has\\nbeen focused once again on the situation in Iraq. There\\nis no need to go over again before this audience the\\nsequence of events that led last spring to the onset of\\nwar in that afflicted part of the world. We all remember\\nthe deep divisions that emerged in the international\\ncommunity during that period, threatening to upset the\\nvery foundations of our Organization. Regardless of the\\nstand that we may have taken individually regarding\\n22\\n\\nthese events, we must now look to the future to\\ndetermine the prospects of a better future for the Iraqi\\npeople. That is the objective that should bring us\\ntogether now.\\nWe are convinced that the United Nations must\\nplay a central role here, on the basis of a clear and\\nsubstantial mandate accompanied by adequate\\nresources. While it is primarily up to the Iraqi people to\\ndecide their own future, we all agree that sovereignty\\nshould be transferred to the Iraqis themselves as soon\\nas possible.\\nIn the phase of political, socio-economic and\\ndiplomatic transition and reconstruction, there must\\nquickly begin a steady transfer of authority and\\nresponsibility to legitimate institutions recognized by\\nthe Iraqi people. That process must include the drafting\\nand adoption of a new constitution, and the holding, as\\nsoon as the situation allows, of free, democratic\\nelections. Among the essentials for this are the\\nrestoration of basic living conditions and security in\\nthe daily lives of Iraqis, reconstruction of the basic\\ninfrastructure and a rapid relaunching of economic\\nactivity.\\nThe Security Council and its members bear the\\nprimary responsibility, but the emergence of an\\nindependent, democratic, prosperous and peaceful Iraq\\nis in the common interest of all Members of our\\nOrganization. Together with its European Union\\npartners, the Government of Luxembourg remains\\nconfident that through a broad mobilization the\\ninternational community will be able to make a\\ndecisive contribution to this objective.\\nYear after year, the General Assembly must\\naddress the situation in the Middle East, particularly\\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because progress\\ntowards a just and lasting peace remains difficult. Even\\nfaced with a resumption of tension and repeated acts of\\nviolence and terrorism, which we emphatically reject,\\nwe have a duty and responsibility to persevere in the\\nsearch for solutions that will enable reconciliation\\namong the States and peoples of the region. The search\\nfor peace must be tireless. The European Union\\nremains prepared and determined to play its role,\\nespecially through its action in the Quartet. We remain\\nconvinced that the course charted by the road map\\nremains the right way to break the current impasse. But\\nall players who are directly involved must display good\\nwill and good faith in re-launching the peace process\\nby creating the indispensable conditions of confidence\\nand security. That is the urgent appeal that we make to\\nthem, that is the urgent task that we must undertake.\\nIn the face of wars and violent conflict, in the\\nface of new threats, in the face of violations of human\\nrights, in the face of poverty and underdevelopment,\\nthe law and multilateralism are an often fragile but\\nirreplaceable recourse for nations. While we must try\\nvigorously to remedy the weaknesses and\\ninsufficiencies in multilateral cooperation, it remains a\\nsource of hope for the men and women of the entire\\nworld. This is a hope that we must not betray, this is\\nthe primary responsibility that is ours at this fifty-\\neighth session of the General Assembly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\ufeffA few days\\nago, the United Nations was again attacked in Baghdad\\n  just one month after the United Nations\\nHeadquarters was targeted in a devastating terrorist\\nattack. My heartfelt sympathies   not only as the\\nForeign Minister of Austria, but also as a former staff\\nmember working here at the Headquarters of the\\nUnited Nations   go to the victims, their loved ones\\nand all colleagues in the United Nations family. Sergio\\nVieira de Mello and his colleagues died as heroes. As a\\nhost country to the United Nations, Austria firmly\\nsupports the Secretary-General's call to provide the\\nutmost security for United Nations personnel on\\nmissions everywhere in the world. Those United\\nNations staff members had dedicated their lives to\\nhelping the most vulnerable. Today, we are called upon\\nto live up to their cause.\\nThis has also been a year of lethal attacks on\\npoliticians who courageously stood for a human face\\nfor politics. We remember, with sadness, the outstanding\\nleadership qualities and invaluable contributions of Zoran\\nDjindjic and Anna Lindh. We are equally saddened to\\nlearn that Ms. Aquila al-Hashimi, member of the Iraqi\\nGoverning Council, has succumbed to the wounds she\\nsuffered in the recent terrorist attack.\\nWhat is at stake today is the way in which the\\nUnited Nations can best shoulder its responsibility for\\nglobal security and peace and how we as Member\\nStates can support the United Nations in this task.\\nAustria, as one of the host countries of the United\\nNations, feels a sense of responsibility for the future\\nfunctioning of the Organization.\\nThe intense public scrutiny of the Security\\nCouncil's actions over the past 12 months has opened a\\nwindow of opportunity for re-launching our efforts to\\nfind unity of purpose based on a common security\\nagenda between all nations. In this context, I greatly\\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General on the\\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration, which\\nmakes one thing crystal clear: we face nothing less\\nthan the need for a far-reaching overhaul of the United\\nNations system in order to enhance efficiency and\\nlegitimacy.\\nWe must respond to this challenge and\\nenergetically revive the reform debate. The urgency we\\nare faced with today should render a new attempt more\\nsuccessful.\\nFirst of all, a priority issue should be the reform\\nof the procedures of the United Nations system. The\\ncomposition of the Security Council is at odds with the\\ngeopolitical reality of the twenty-first century. It does\\nnot reflect the growing number of United Nations\\nMembers or the necessary regional balance. Decision-\\nmaking is therefore perceived by many as lacking\\nlegitimacy. In my view, this discussion is not only\\nabout who should be represented in the Security\\nCouncil, but   and this is at least as important  \\nabout ensuring that the decision-making is in the\\ninterests of world peace and global security. In this\\ncontext the regional groups have to accept their\\nresponsibility by coming forward with solutions.\\nAs a member of the European Union, which is\\nabout to give itself a constitution for the twenty-first\\ncentury, it is important to note that we are moving\\ngradually towards a genuine common foreign and\\nsecurity policy. To this end, a security doctrine is being\\nelaborated by High Representative and Secretary\\nGeneral Solana for the European Council. Speaking\\nwith one voice also means more common positions in\\nSecurity Council matters. This logic might one day\\neven lead to the European Union having a seat on the\\nSecurity Council.\\nAustria sees its national interest best served by\\nthe multilateral approach of a strong United Nations\\nsystem, with the Security Council living up to its\\nresponsibility for world peace and with the primacy of\\ninternational law and the universality of human rights\\nmaintained by all.\\nInternational terrorism is a direct and lethal threat\\nto global and collective security. The terror attacks of\\n11 September 2001, and those against the United\\nNations Headquarters in Baghdad, have one thing in\\ncommon: they were targeted against civilization as a\\nwhole. United Nations leadership is needed more than\\never to prevent and combat terrorism globally. In the\\nUnited Nations system-wide division of labour, the\\nVienna-based Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\\nOffice on Drugs and Crime contributes to counter-\\nterrorism efforts and offers valuable technical\\nassistance to States with regard to signing, ratifying\\nand implementing international conventions and\\nprotocols related to terrorism.\\n36\\n \\nAnother hard threat to international security is the\\nproliferation of arms, in particular the spread of\\nweapons of mass destruction. What is needed is\\nobvious: the strengthening and universalization of\\nexisting disarmament, non-proliferation and export\\ncontrol regimes. As a practical contribution to this\\ncause, Austria has agreed to serve as an immediate\\ncentral contact for the 109 subscriber States of the\\nHague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile\\nProliferation.\\nFurthermore, the Conference on Facilitating the\\nEntry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\\nBan Treaty, which I had the honour to open on 3\\nSeptember, appealed, in its Final Declaration, to all\\nStates to sign and ratify that Treaty, in particular to\\nthose 12 countries whose ratification is required for the\\nTreaty's entry into force. Let me repeat and support\\nthat appeal.\\nIn the field of non-proliferation, the work of the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under the\\nleadership of Director General Mohamed ElBaradei is\\nessential. Last week's General Conference of IAEA\\nunanimously endorsed the necessity of strengthening\\nthe international nuclear safeguards system. Recent\\nissues of compliance concerning Iran and the\\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea have again\\nshown the central role of IAEA.\\nOne of the most important immediate tasks is the\\nstabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. We are\\nconvinced that success in the aim of restoring the\\nsovereignty of Iraq as quickly as possible will hardly\\nbe feasible without the United Nations playing its part\\non the basis of a sound, viable and coherent policy.\\nIn line with the human security approach, Austria\\nwas among the first to offer humanitarian aid. In\\nAustrian hospitals we provided urgent medical\\nassistance for children in critical condition.\\nFurthermore, Austria participates in the Adopt a\\nHospital' programme and is about to equip two\\nhospitals in Nazariyah. Together with Slovenia and\\nJordan, we are preparing the establishment, south of\\nBaghdad, of a centre for war-traumatized children.\\nThese are efforts aimed at providing relief for the\\nweakest and most vulnerable members of Iraqi society.\\nIn spite of renewed efforts by the international\\ncommunity to revive the Middle East peace process,\\nthe conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has\\nagain tragically deteriorated. But current setbacks must\\nnot stall the implementation of the road map. Austria\\ncontinues to strongly support the role and the\\nresponsibility of the Quartet. The concept of two States\\nremains the only viable solution. The promise of land for\\npeace must be reactivated to create a basis of trust and\\nrespect on which to build. Terrorism destroys such hope.\\nI turn now to what the Secretary-General called\\nsoft threats. Here, his report coincides with the goals of\\nmy recently concluded presidency of the Human\\nSecurity Network to strengthen the universal system by\\nforging interregional consensus on issues pertaining to\\nhuman security. That places the individual human\\nbeing and his or her protection at the centre of our\\npolicies. As a concrete result of my presidency, the\\nministers of the Network adopted a manual on human\\nrights education. That unique training tool, based on\\nthe universality of human rights, is designed for global\\nuse and adaptable to target groups. The Network also\\nadopted a strategy for supporting children affected by\\narmed conflict, along with a training curriculum for\\nchild rights experts and a compendium of the relevant\\ninternational child protection standards   an effort in\\nwhich we cooperated closely with the Special\\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Olara Otunnu.\\nThe Millennium Development Goals have\\nbecome fundamental benchmarks in our efforts to\\nachieve more inclusive and equitable globalization, and\\nwe   both developing and developed countries  \\nneed to strive for their implementation at the global,\\nregional and national levels. In that context, as part of\\nthe partnership effort agreed to in Monterrey, I am\\nhappy to announce that Austrian official development\\nassistance will be increased by 35 per cent in 2004.\\nThe Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\\nDevelopment recognized the importance of energy for\\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\\nAustria welcomes the additional impetus created by the\\nRenewables 2004 Conference. I am also glad that the\\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership\\nwill establish its secretariat in Vienna. Meanwhile,\\nAustria will use the synergies created by these\\nactivities to continue its endeavours to build up the\\ncapacity of the Global Forum on Sustainable Energy,\\nwhich I launched in 1999.\\nAt this point, let me express Austria's\\ndisappointment that the Ministerial Meeting in Cancun\\ncould not sustain the momentum towards achieving\\nacceptable solutions for fair trade. Such a setback must\\n37\\n \\nnot repeat itself, not least because trade is an engine for\\ndevelopment. I support the notion that we also need to\\nbegin a reform of the decision-making process within\\nthe World Trade Organization. We must avoid a\\ntendency towards ending multilateralism and towards\\nrelying exclusively on bilateralism or regionalism in\\ntrade.\\nThis year, we commemorate the tenth anniversary\\nof the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human\\nRights, which confirmed the universality, indivisibility\\nand interrelatedness of human rights as well as the\\nimportant nexus among human rights, democracy and\\ndevelopment. Human rights disasters that we have\\nwitnessed since   such as those in Rwanda and\\nSrebrenica   must not be allowed to recur. One\\nessential step in that regard is the Optional Protocol to\\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,\\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,\\nwhich I signed this morning.\\nHuman rights must protect in particular the weak,\\nwomen and children. As a woman and as Foreign\\nMinister of my country, I have always spoken out in\\nfavour of the rights of women and against the\\nfrequently terrible infringements of those rights, such\\nas genital mutilation, the stoning of women and the\\nenslaving and trading of women and girls on the sex\\nmarkets. Those horrendous practices must stop. And\\nthere is reason for hope: today is a good day for\\nwomen's rights. News has reached us that Ms. Armina\\nLawal was acquitted by the Nigerian court. I am very\\nhappy about that outcome. Let us remind ourselves that\\nthe all-important fight against terrorism must not entail\\na lessening of hard-fought-for human rights standards.\\nOver the years and under the guidance of the\\nSecretary-General, Austria has placed great importance\\non a comprehensive dialogue of cultures and\\ncivilizations. This November, I will host a second\\nmedia seminar on the topic of Cultural diversity: the\\nquest for common moral ground and the public role of\\nthe media', exploring how the free media can\\ncontribute to cultural understanding and respect. A\\nseminal event in the context of that dialogue was the\\nfirst-ever conference of European Islamic leaders in\\nAustria, held in June of this year, which adopted a\\nstrongly worded declaration in support of tolerance.\\nHow can we contribute to stability in the regions\\nof the world? Europe has its own experience with\\ncreating a zone of stability and welfare. The signing of\\nthe European Union (EU) accession treaty with 10 new\\nprospective members in April of this year is an\\nimportant contribution to security on our continent.\\nThe strategy of EU is also geared towards exporting\\nthat peace dividend to new neighbours of the enlarged\\nEU further to the east and to the south-east and in the\\nMediterranean region. Let me highlight one\\nencouraging event from that region, which I was able\\nto witness from a close vantage point when I visited\\nBelgrade less than two weeks ago. I am talking about\\nthe important gesture of President Marović of Serbia\\nand Montenegro and of President Mesić of Croatia,\\napologizing on behalf of those of their countries'\\ncitizens, who had committed acts of violence against\\none another in recent history.\\nThe vision of global solidarity, collective security\\nand a global culture of human rights are rooted in the\\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\\nand of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I\\nam grateful to the Secretary-General for his courage\\nand leadership to engage us in an honest, future-\\noriented debate. The time to act is now. I can again\\nassure the Secretary-General that Austria supports him\\nin that important endeavour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\ufeffI wish to\\nbegin by congratulating the President, on his election\\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\\nsession and wish him every success with his work. I\\nalso wish to thank his predecessor, President Kavan,\\nfor the dedication with which he presided over the\\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\\nI also wish to endorse the statements made by the\\nItalian presidency on behalf of the European Union.\\nThis year is a special one for Germany’s work\\nwithin the United Nations. History is both a reminder\\nand a guide for us. Thirty years ago, on 18 September\\n1973, the United Nations welcomed Germany back into\\nthe fold of the family of nations. My predecessor,\\nFederal Chancellor Willy Brandt, paved the way for\\nthat move. His standing as an anti-fascist inspired\\nconfidence for Germany. His passionate commitment to\\ninternationalism went far beyond the policy of détente\\nin the then East-West conflict.\\nIn 1980 he made an urgent appeal to the\\ncommunity of States with a report entitled “North-\\nSouth, A Programme for Survival”. He wrote:\\n“The globalization of the dangers resulting from\\nwars, chaos and self-destruction calls for a\\ndomestic policy that goes far beyond national\\nborders.”\\nWe are strongly committed to this task, and I\\nthink that we Germans are not the only ones who are\\ncommitted to it, because, as I said, history is our guide.\\nIt guides us towards intensive international\\ncooperation, of course under the auspices of the United\\nNations, that we must strengthen through courageous\\nreforms. It guides us towards a universal order based\\non the rule of law and human dignity, on good,\\nresponsible governance and prosperity that is truly\\nshared by all people. It also guides us towards security\\nand peace through comprehensive prevention. We must\\nact resolutely by pursuing an effective multilateral\\nstrategy wherever peace is threatened and human rights\\nare violated. But we must act just as resolutely to\\nprevent conflict and create stable structures so that\\npeople can lead their lives in freedom and tolerance\\nwith one another.\\nThirty years ago, Germany was a country with\\nlimited sovereignty, divided by the Iron Curtain. Today,\\nGermany is a sovereign nation, a civil Power in the\\nheart of a united Europe. We live in a common area of\\nfreedom, the rule of law, prosperity and social\\nresponsibility. This goes to show that development\\ntowards justice and peace is indeed possible and we\\nshall not cease to support endeavours to that end\\nanywhere in the world, be it in the Middle East, in\\nAfrica or in any other crisis area. Bearing in mind our\\nown history, we are indeed assuming responsibility for\\na cooperative policy of peace. This we do by\\nemploying economic, political and humanitarian\\nmeans.\\nBut we are also assuming military responsibility,\\nshoulder to shoulder with our partners in NATO and\\nthe European Union, where there is absolutely no other\\nway to secure peace and protect human beings. Today,\\nmore than 9,000 members of the German armed forces\\nand police are deployed on international peace\\nmissions. Our top priority is our commitment to peace\\nin Afghanistan. Germany is willing to maintain its\\ncommitment there in the long term and we are ready to\\nincrease it beyond its present scope. The basis for such\\ncommitment is the Charter of the United Nations.\\nIn the Unification Treaty, Germany vowed that it\\nwould only deploy its armed forces within the\\nframework of this Charter. The Charter provides us\\nwith “the necessary building blocks to ensure that our\\ncommon humanity is an inclusive one, built on values\\nsuch as tolerance and dignity”. These were the words\\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello, who on 19 August 2003 fell\\nvictim to an underhanded criminal attack in Baghdad.\\nHe was killed along with 22 others, including many\\nmembers of the United Nations staff working for the\\npeople of Iraq and their hopes of a better future.\\nWe are deeply affected by their deaths and must\\nhonour them by taking on their legacy. Our response\\nmust be to strengthen the role and commitment of the\\nUnited Nations in Iraq. Only the United Nations can\\nguarantee the legitimacy required to enable the people\\nof Iraq to speedily rebuild their country under an\\nindependent, representative Government. Germany\\nstands ready to support such a process. We are ready to\\n24\\n\\nprovide humanitarian, technical and economic\\nassistance and could also train Iraqi security personnel.\\nInternational terrorism, failing States and the\\ndangers posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction all threaten our joint security. The obvious\\nquestion is: What must be done to truly enhance\\nsecurity? We must capture the terrorists and their\\nmasters and destroy their infrastructure. There can be\\nno doubt that we must prevent any further proliferation\\nof nuclear weapons. We must strengthen the\\ninspections regimes and pursue a policy of controlled\\ndisarmament.\\nBut as we know from history, as well as our own\\nexperience, to follow any strategy focused narrowly on\\nthe military and the police would be a recipe for\\nfailure. Rather, what is needed is to address the root\\ncauses of terrorism and insecurity. To combat\\nfanaticism, we must ensure social and material as well\\nas cultural security. That can only be achieved on the\\nbasis of a broad concept of security. If we want to\\noutlaw infamy we must put an end to lawlessness. That\\nis the core task, indeed, of the international courts of\\njustice and especially the International Criminal Court.\\nIn order to win hearts and minds for freedom,\\npeace and an open society, we must help people to\\nacquire a greater stake in society, build better lives for\\nthem and provide them with a secure environment.\\nAfghanistan is a good example of this. There, the\\ninternational community succeeded in liberating the\\nAfghan people from the scourge of the Taliban and\\nal Qaeda.\\nAt the same time, the Petersberg Conference on\\nAfghanistan, held in Bonn under the auspices of the\\nUnited Nations, created a political framework for\\nrebuilding the country. This process needs our\\ncontinued support. There must also be sustained\\ninternational commitment to the task of strengthening\\nsecurity. In the long run, the fight against terrorism can\\nbe won only if people see that it produces tangible\\nbenefits in their everyday lives. They need to\\nexperience at first hand that being once again part of\\nthe international community means not only greater\\nfreedom and more security, but also entails better\\ndevelopment opportunities and a greater stake in\\nsociety.\\nThere is no doubt that we have already made\\nmajor strides towards realizing our common goals\\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. More\\ncountries than ever before now have democratic\\nGovernments. Our concerted efforts have enabled more\\npeople than ever before to put poverty behind them.\\nBut we must note that the gap between the world’s rich\\nand poor has still not been closed and the fight against\\nhunger, injustice and oppression is still far from won.\\nFor this reason, eradicating poverty remains an\\nimperative of our policy for peace and stability.\\nThere has been a drastic reduction in the number\\nof wars fought between States. In the Balkans, for\\nexample, resolute action by NATO and the United\\nNations enabled us to put an end to certain wars and\\nprevent others from breaking out in the first place.\\nNevertheless, our world has become — and not just\\nsince the barbaric terrorist attacks in New York and\\nWashington or indeed Bali, Casablanca, Moscow or\\nDjerba — a dramatically more insecure place. New\\nthreats that no country in the world can tackle\\neffectively on its own, make international cooperation\\nmore vital than ever before. Such threats also require\\nnew strategies and that is why we are all called upon to\\nreview whether the instruments available to the United\\nNations are still appropriate for tackling these new\\nchallenges. We all have a responsibility to ensure that\\npeople and their rights are also protected in situations\\nother than inter-State wars. They must be protected\\nfrom genocide and the consequences of random\\nviolence as well. A political commitment to\\ncomprehensive prevention must further strengthen the\\nUnited Nations monopoly on the use of force as well as\\nthe institutions of international law.\\nWithin the United Nations we need to muster the\\nstrength to launch overdue institutional reforms. My\\nGovernment fully and wholeheartedly supports the\\nproposals made by the Secretary-General. We must\\nagree how to ensure in the future an even better\\nallocation of abilities, skills and scarce resources. I\\nalso share the view of the Secretary-General that the\\nlegitimacy of the Security Council depends on how\\nwell it represents all nations and all regions. It is true\\nthat the Council must be reformed and enlarged. First\\nand foremost, it must also include more representatives\\nof the developing countries. Let me reiterate that in the\\ncontext of such reform Germany is ready to assume\\ngreater responsibility.\\nThe world of the twenty-first century offers us, its\\ninhabitants, ample scope for change, for better or\\nworse. Given the wealth of opportunities and the\\nimmense dangers ahead, we have no choice but to\\n25\\n\\nstrive for greater international partnership and expand\\nand strengthen multilateralism. We will only be able to\\nmake our world a more secure place if we can also\\nmake it more fair and equitable. It was for that very\\npurpose, after all, that the international community\\ncreated the United Nations. That is its mandate. Let us\\njoin together to make the United Nations even stronger.\\nLet us make sure that it can fulfil its mandate to\\nmaintain international peace and security and that it\\ncan achieve greater justice for all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\ufeffIn 2000, at the dawn of\\nthe new millennium, the heads of State and\\nGovernment of the Member States met here to reaffirm\\ntheir shared goals. Three years later, that international\\nconsensus has eroded. Member States perceive threats\\ndifferently, and they do not share the same priorities.\\nSome States emphasize the fight against terrorism and\\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In\\nother regions in the world, civil wars, small arms,\\npoverty, hunger and AIDS are the main dangers.\\n21\\n\\nCan the international community reach a\\nconsensus on the objectives to be attained and the way\\nto achieve them? What importance should we give to\\nmultilateral cooperation? Has the time not come to\\nreview the system of collective security inherited from\\nthe Second World War? Could it be that the United\\nNations is due for far-reaching reform?\\nThe fact that so many heads of State and\\nGovernment have responded to the Secretary-General's\\ninvitation is a preliminary answer. It is an encouraging\\nsign. The Member States look to the United Nations to\\nseek solutions. We must seize the opportunity of this\\ndebate to reaffirm our commitment to multilateral\\ncooperation and the goals of the United Nations.\\nLife in society demands a minimum of order,\\nrules and solidarity. That also applies to international\\nrelations. Switzerland attaches great importance to\\nrespect for international law, which explains its\\ncommitment to humanitarian law or to the International\\nCriminal Court. Without international law, many\\ncountries would feel themselves at the mercy of the law\\nof the mightiest. The great powers, like the smaller\\nones, need a multilateral framework to resolve their\\ndifferences.\\nThe time has come to rethink the role of the\\nUnited Nations. Almost 60 years after the foundation\\nof the Organization, the threats have changed, as have\\nthe geopolitical realities. Terrorism and the\\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction have\\ntaken on more threatening dimensions. Civil wars have\\nmultiplied. AIDS has become the most deadly\\nepidemic in the history of humankind. Poverty is far\\nfrom being eradicated.\\nSecurity can no longer be addressed in purely\\nmilitary terms. We need to review our vision of\\nsecurity by focusing greater attention on individuals.\\nBy broadening our approach to security and by placing\\nfresh emphasis on human security, we can overcome\\nsome of the current differences between the North and\\nthe South.\\nTogether with other countries, Switzerland is\\nendeavouring to promote the idea of human security.\\nThis year it will commit itself to the issues of the\\nproliferation of light weapons and anti-personnel\\nmines. We hope the General Assembly will establish a\\nworking group to develop an instrument for marking\\nand tracing small arms. If the Members of the\\nOrganization concur, Switzerland is ready to take the\\nchair.\\nThe Swiss Government also takes an active\\ninterest in the issue of migration. We are working with\\nother countries to establish a global commission on\\ninternational migration, which will be asked to make\\nrecommendations.\\nIn order to promote human security, we must also\\nkeep the promises made in the field of development. In\\nthe Millennium Declaration we have undertaken to\\nensure that globalization becomes a positive force for\\nall humankind. To that end, we have adopted a series of\\nclear objectives, and deadlines to meet them have been\\nset. But merely proclaiming goals is not enough; we\\nmust now fulfil them. If the rich countries   and my\\ncountry is among them   do not keep their promises,\\nthey will end up causing poor countries to lose hope.\\nIn Cancun, the members of the World Trade\\nOrganization (WTO) tried to revive trade liberalization.\\nAlthough positions converged somewhat,\\ndisagreements persist and there is a risk of lasting\\nfailure. That would result in weakened growth at the\\nglobal level, to the detriment of all countries. We need\\nto give negotiations another chance and, above all,\\navoid the lure of protectionism.\\nTo affirm a belief in the multilateral system\\nshould not blind us to its weak points. The United\\nNations needs more thorough reform.\\nSwitzerland considers that the role of the United\\nNations in the economic and social fields must be\\ndefined. We must better take account of the links\\nbetween international security and economic\\ndevelopment. Relations between the United Nations,\\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and WTO should also be\\nreconsidered by a group of independent eminent\\npersons.\\nWe must also focus our attention on the\\nfunctioning of the Organization itself. In the General\\nAssembly, resolutions that are adopted are too often\\nreduced to the lowest common denominator or to a\\nlong, vague wish list, with no real impact. The\\nAssembly must be revitalized. There is a need to\\nreduce the number of agenda items, limit the length of\\ntexts and avoid the proliferation of resolutions on\\nissues that overlap.\\nWith regard to the Security Council, a consensus\\nalready exists on the fact that its composition no longer\\n22\\n\\nsufficiently reflects contemporary geopolitical realities.\\nSwitzerland supports the idea of enlarging the Council.\\nThat could be done without harming its effectiveness as\\nlong as the increase in the number of members remains\\nwithin reasonable bounds and takes into account the\\nvarious regional sensibilities.\\nIn the last few years, countries not members of\\nthe Council have been given more opportunities to\\nparticipate in the Council's work. Switzerland\\nwelcomes those efforts. However, the crucial decisions\\ntoo often remain confined to the restricted circle of the\\nfive permanent members. All members of the Security\\nCouncil should be permanently involved in the\\ndecision-making process. It is also important to\\ninstitutionalize the modalities of participation for the\\nother Member States. For example, consultation\\nmechanisms with those States most directly affected by\\nconflict areas should be strengthened. It should be\\nnecessary for non-permanent members of the Council\\nto feel a greater responsibility to represent the views of\\nthose who elected them.\\nThe right of veto is a privilege involving special\\nresponsibilities. It should be used only in exceptional\\ncircumstances. When a permanent member exercises its\\nright of veto, would it not be desirable for it then to\\nexplain its action to the General Assembly? That way,\\nthat member could make its position better understood\\nby the international community.\\nAnother goal is to open the United Nations to\\ncivil society. Switzerland welcomes the decision of the\\nSecretary-General to set up a panel of experts to\\nconsider the possible ways to achieve that.\\nIt is in this spirit of openness towards civil\\nsociety that preparations are being carried out for the\\nWorld Summit on the Information Society, due to take\\nplace in Geneva in December. More than half of the\\nworld's population does not have access to a telephone.\\nThe use of Internet is even more limited. The goal of\\nthe Summit, a part of the larger framework of the\\nMillennium Goals, is to discuss ways to narrow the\\ndigital divide between the rich and poor countries. New\\ntechnologies must be placed at the service of\\ndevelopment, human rights and democracy.\\nI invite all Member States to participate actively\\nin the Summit. Many heads of State and Government\\nhave announced their intention to attend, which gives\\nme great pleasure. I must address, above all, my\\ncolleagues of the industrialized countries: we must\\nshoulder our responsibilities. I appeal to them not to\\nmiss that important appointment. We need a North-\\nSouth dialogue at the highest level. As I have already\\nsaid, we must keep our promises.\\nIn recent months, Iraq has made visible some\\ninternational tensions. We must now search together to\\nfind solutions for the future. We all face the same\\ndanger: that of Iraq falling prey to disorder and\\ninstability. The United Nations must be given its place\\nin Iraq and must receive a clearer mandate from the\\nSecurity Council. At the same time, determined\\nprogress must be made towards restoring Iraqi\\nsovereignty.\\nIn its national history, Switzerland has a long\\ntradition of harmonious coexistence among its different\\ncommunities. We well understand that no single\\npolitical model fits all situations. Nevertheless,\\nSwitzerland is ready to share its experience and to\\nprovide support for the process of drawing up a new\\nconstitution in Iraq.\\nSwitzerland joined the United Nations as a\\nneutral country. That does not prevent it from\\ndefending the universal values to which it is attached.\\nIn this, Switzerland wishes to collaborate with the\\nother Member States, drawing on the strength of the\\nOrganization. At this point, I would like to pay tribute\\nto the United Nations and all its staff, who have just\\nsuffered a deadly attack in Baghdad. Every day,\\nthroughout the world, the United Nations and its\\nspecialized agencies do irreplaceable work.\\nThe Secretary-General has spoken of peace as a\\ndream in suspense. I believe that this also applies to the\\nother ideals for which the United Nations stands:\\njustice, solidarity and respect for human dignity.\\nDreams are an essential part of the vision of the United\\nNations, but so are action, realism, courage and\\nperseverance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\ufeffThe deaths\\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues leave a\\nterrible void. The loss of so many dedicated servants of\\nthe United Nations at its headquarters in Baghdad fills\\nus with shock, grief and concern. This atrocity and the\\nother murderous attacks we have seen in the past two\\nyears are chilling evidence that terrorists are ruthlessly\\ntargeting the civilized world. Terrorism is a direct\\nthreat to us all, to humanity as a whole.\\nWeapons of mass destruction are the other direct\\nthreat, an even worse threat if such weapons were to\\nfall into the hands of terrorists.\\nIn addition to these direct threats to peace and\\nsecurity, we are faced with, in the words of Secretary-\\nGeneral Kofi Annan, “soft threats”: poverty and hunger,\\nenvironmental degradation and diseases of mass\\ndestruction like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\\nWhat all these threats have in common is that\\nthey do not stop at national borders. Their often lethal\\nconsequences affect groups of countries, whole\\ncontinents or even the entire planet. The only way to\\ntackle them is by collective action. Enforcement and\\nimplementation are the key.\\nBut do we have the capacity to take such action?\\nIs the existing multilateral system with its institutions\\nand rules capable of responding to the hard threats and\\nsoft threats we are facing? I doubt it. Take the growing\\ndanger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Can we\\nallow a few countries to reject the rules agreed to by\\n187 other countries? Can we run the risk of countries\\nturning into suppliers of nuclear arms to terrorist\\norganizations? No, we cannot. And if today’s rules\\ncannot avert States putting humanity at risk, we must\\ntighten those rules and we must be ready to collectively\\nenforce them.\\nI therefore welcome President Bush’s proposal\\nfor a binding Security Council resolution, tightening up\\nthe non-proliferation rules. I suggest that we build on\\nexisting export control regimes and make them\\nuniversal and legally binding. This approach would be\\nin line with the successful example of Security Council\\nresolution 1373 (2001), containing binding obligations\\nfor States to take action against terrorism. Other\\nelements in a more forceful multilateral system are\\n15\\n\\ngreater attention to conflict prevention, better use of\\nsanctions or “smart sanctions”, an upgrading of the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency’s inspections\\nregime and, as suggested by President Chirac, a\\npermanent instrument for inspections at the disposal of\\nthe Security Council.\\nMore robust multilateral action is also needed in\\nour dealings with failed States. I am encouraged by the\\nincreased willingness of the international community to\\ntake more determined action. Liberia is a test case. The\\nBrahimi report has shown us the right direction.\\nPeacekeeping operations can only be effective if they\\nare based on a strong mandate, fully implemented on\\nthe ground and fully backed by the key players in the\\nSecurity Council. The five permanent members bear a\\nspecial responsibility for global peace and security\\nNoblesse oblige.\\nThe United Nations is now also at the centre of\\nthe debate about Iraq. Let us put our past differences\\non Iraq behind us. It is crucial now that the\\ninternational community support the Iraqi people in\\ntheir reconstruction efforts. I trust that the Security\\nCouncil will reach agreement, as soon as possible, on\\nwhat we all want, in other words, stabilization, security\\nand transfer of sovereignty to a legitimate Iraqi\\ngovernment. This will also allow the United Nations\\nand the other multilateral institutions to make their\\nindispensable contributions to a better future for the\\nIraqi people.\\nA stronger United Nations is also needed for the\\neffective promotion and protection of human rights. I\\nregret that we do not live up to the expectations of the\\noppressed. The great dependence of the United Nations\\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights on voluntary\\ncontributions is a major concern. His office should\\ninstead receive a larger allocation from the regular\\nUnited Nations budget. The promotion and protection\\nof human rights is United Nations core business.\\nSpeaking of human rights, there is no doubt that\\nterrorism itself ranks as one of the most serious threats\\nto democracy and the enjoyment of human rights.\\nTerrorists seek to destroy democracy, freedom and\\ntolerance. If we sacrifice those universal values in the\\nstruggle against terrorists, we play into their hands.\\nIf I may speak for a moment as Chairman-in-\\nOffice of the Organization for Security and\\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), I can assure you that\\nour experience shows that policies aimed at promoting\\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance can\\nreinforce each other as parts of a more comprehensive\\nsecurity strategy. The International Criminal Court is\\nanother example of how to ensure that international\\nnorms are upheld in cases where national Governments\\nfail to do so.\\nOn the trafficking of human beings, women and\\nchildren in particular, I share the concerns expressed by\\nPresident Bush. He was right to draw a comparison\\nwith slavery. For the OSCE, the threat posed by the\\ninternational trafficking of drugs, of small arms and of\\nwomen and children is a top priority. We have already\\ntaken concrete action, adopting the OSCE Action Plan\\nto combat trafficking in human beings as an instrument\\nfor protecting our people. This Action Plan could serve\\nas a model for worldwide action.\\nYet another reason why we need a robust\\nmultilateral system is that we must break the cycles of\\npoverty and violence we witness in many parts of\\nAfrica. This implies restoring stability and order as a\\nprecondition for reconstruction and development. It\\nalso requires an integrated approach. To this end my\\nGovernment will set up a stability fund to tackle the\\ntwin challenges of development and security. Because\\ndevelopment and security are closely linked, the\\nMillennium Development Goals should remain at the\\ncentre of our policies. The Netherlands remains\\ncommitted to allocating 0.8 per cent of our gross domestic\\nproduct to development cooperation and I call on all\\ncountries to implement their Monterrey commitments.\\nBut development is not just a matter of aid, it will also\\ndepend on liberalizing trade. I am disappointed that the\\nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in\\nCancún failed to produce results.\\nThe legitimacy of the decisions of the Security\\nCouncil is questioned because the composition of the\\nCouncil no longer reflects today’s geopolitical realities.\\nHowever, expansion is not a solution in itself.\\nEffectiveness can easily fall victim to the quest for\\nlegitimacy. Crucial to restored legitimacy is better\\ninteraction between the members of the Council and\\nthe United Nations membership at large. Members of\\nthe Council should represent relevant and broad\\nsections of world opinion.\\nI agree with the Secretary-General that we need\\nto take a hard look at the existing architecture of\\ninternational institutions. Many other organizations I\\nknow well, such as the OSCE, the European Union\\n16\\n\\n(EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\n(NATO) (and I hope to get to know the last\\norganization even better in the near future), are in the\\nprocess of redefining their roles in drastically changed\\ncircumstances. The United Nations cannot be left\\nbehind. Interaction between the United Nations on the\\none hand, and regional organizations such as the\\nOSCE, the EU and NATO on the other, is growing.\\nThere is considerable scope for intensifying that\\ninteraction, as is indeed foreseen in the Charter.\\nAs the Italian Presidency of the European Union\\nillustrated in its intervention here some days ago, the\\nUnited Nations can count on the EU in the quest for\\nrobust multilateralism. As a member State of the EU, the\\nNetherlands fully endorses the Presidency’s statement.\\nThe EU’s new emphasis on countering the proliferation of\\nweapons of mass destruction in its common foreign and\\nsecurity policy is an example of how we want our\\ncommon efforts to be in the vanguard.\\nLet me now focus on the General Assembly. Take\\nthe example of how we deal with the Israeli-Palestinian\\nconflict. Let us connect the General Assembly to\\nreality. Instead of dealing with 23 resolutions, should\\nwe not try to find our strength in a more focused\\ncentral message, supported by all, a message that calls\\nupon both Israel and the Palestinians to put an end to\\nthe bloodshed and violence and to immediately\\nimplement the road map as the only viable way to long-\\nlasting peace? The EU will continue to do all it can,\\ntogether with its partners in the Quartet, to help\\nPalestinians and Israelis reach that destination. I hope\\nthat this Assembly can contribute.\\nThe Assembly should be made more effective. I\\nneed not repeat what you all know about overlapping\\nor hardly relevant agenda items, repetitive debates and\\nresolutions and the prevalence of the lowest common\\ndenominator. As a contribution to improvement, my\\ncountry tabled the Greentree report, the result of a\\nseminar involving representatives from a wide circle of\\ncountries. The Greentree report aims at restoring the\\nGeneral Assembly to its rightful place as the centre\\nstage for worldwide deliberations on our common\\nproblems. We are certain that in that endeavour, we\\nwill be able to count on the leadership and wisdom of\\nthe President of the General Assembly.\\nMy Government wholeheartedly supports the\\ndecision of the Secretary-General to establish a panel\\nof eminent persons. We look forward to his\\nrecommendations for next year’s session of the\\nAssembly. Meanwhile, we should not sit back and wait.\\nIt is upon us Member States to engage now in the\\ndebate on the pertinent reform questions the Secretary-\\nGeneral has put to us.\\nIn order to defuse the threats we face and to leave\\na better world for future generations, we need to do\\nmore than talk. We must act and we must act together.\\nWe need clear rules and strong institutions —\\ninstitutions that ensure that the rules of the multilateral\\ngame are respected, strengthened and enforced. We\\nneed a multilateral system with teeth; we need a\\nmultilateral system that works.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'It is a special honour for me, as a member of the new\\nGovernment of Luxembourg and its Minister for\\nForeign Affairs and Immigration, to take the floor for\\nthe first time before this gathering of the nations of the\\nworld.\\nYou, sir, have acceded to the presidency of the\\nGeneral Assembly at a time when decisions fraught\\nwith consequences for the future of our Organization\\nmust be prepared and discussed. Our Secretary-General\\nhas reminded us that the United Nations is at a\\ncrossroads. I have no doubt that, under your skilled and\\nwise leadership, our General Assembly will be able\\neffectively and decisively to provide constructive and\\nconsensual responses to the great issues of our time.\\nThe session ahead, leading us to the\\ncommemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the\\nestablishment of the United Nations, must be one of\\nrenewal for multilateralism. I can assure you, Sir, that\\nmy country — a founding Member of the United\\nNations — intends to contribute actively to that crucial\\nwork, in particular within the presidency of the Council\\nof the European Union, to which Luxembourg will\\naccede on 1 January 2005, following the current\\npresidency of the Netherlands. It goes without saying\\nthat I fully subscribe to the statement made by my\\ncolleague, Mr. Bernard Bot, Minister for Foreign\\nAffairs of the Netherlands, before this Assembly.\\nFrom this moment until the sixtieth session of the\\nGeneral Assembly, three themes will be the focus of\\nour attention: issues linked to the maintenance of peace\\nand security; the complex question of development and\\nits financing; and United Nations reform.\\nWe must begin this genuine relaunching of\\nmultilateral cooperation first of all in the area of the\\nmaintenance of peace and security, basing our action\\non the United Nations Charter. While regional crises\\nand civil wars have multiplied in various areas of the\\nglobe, in particular on the African continent over the\\npast year, history has taught us, often tragically and\\npainfully, that peace and stability can only be\\nmaintained and guaranteed within the framework of an\\ninternational order based on the rule of law and shared\\nstrong and effective institutions based on fundamental\\nshared values. This has been stated in our superb\\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the\\nsubsequent normative instruments that supplemented it.\\nThis is also the lesson learned from the fratricidal\\nhorrors and conflicts of the past century between\\nmember States of the European Union, which now we\\nare gratified to see expanded to 25 members.\\nIn that context, we look with concern toward the\\nMiddle and Near East, where situations of tension and\\nof open conflict seem to be worsening. Regarding the\\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, we must emphatically\\nrecall here, given a situation characterized by\\nnumerous impasses on all sides, that the path of\\nnegotiation and compromise remains the only\\nreasonable path and that the road map remains the only\\nway to achieve a negotiated solution between the\\nparties, based on the coexistence of two States, namely,\\nan independent and viable Palestinian State, living in\\npeace next to Israel, within secure and recognized\\nborders. This was also vigorously reaffirmed by the\\nQuartet the day before yesterday. In the same way, any\\nwithdrawal by Israel from the Gaza Strip must take\\nplace within the context of the political process\\ndescribed by the road map.\\nThe unanimous adoption of Security Council\\nresolution 1546 (2004) on the situation in Iraq and the\\nsubsequent restoration of Iraqi sovereignty constitute\\nan important stage in the process of political, social\\nand economic reconstruction of this battered country.\\nThe European Union, for its part, adopted in early\\nSeptember a set of measures designed to further\\nstrengthen the European commitment to Iraq. We hope\\nthat conditions will soon be such that the United\\nNations will be able to fully play its proper role, in\\nparticular regarding the political process, the\\npreparation for elections, humanitarian assistance and\\nreconstruction.\\nLuxembourg has also been following with the\\ngreatest attention developments in the situation in the\\nGreat Lakes region, the Western Balkans, and, in\\nparticular, in Kosovo, as well as in Darfur in Sudan.\\nMy country fully associates itself with the positions\\npresented here by my Dutch colleague on behalf of the\\nEuropean Union.\\n15\\n\\nThe preservation of peace, crisis prevention and\\nmanagement and peacekeeping are among the noblest\\ntasks of our Organization. The Security Council has an\\nimportant role to play here. We should not hesitate to\\nconsider innovative solutions in defining new\\napproaches and institutional processes to strengthen\\nour collective capacity for prevention and action on the\\nbasis of the Charter.\\nHere I would like to welcome the measures taken\\nby the Secretary-General regarding the prevention of\\ngenocide. I would venture to hope that the High-level\\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change will be able\\nto put before us proposals to both improve our capacity\\nfor shared action and cope with the new threats to\\npeace and security, among which, first and foremost,\\nare terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction. United Nations instruments in fighting\\nterrorism were recently enhanced by the adoption of\\nSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) and the\\nimplementation measures which flow from it.\\nHowever, the recent report of the Analytical Support\\nand Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security\\nCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution\\n1267 (1999) concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and\\nAssociated Individuals and Entities reminded us that a\\ngreat deal still remains to be done to put an end to\\nthese despicable and unacceptable practices which\\nleave so many families throughout the world in\\nmourning.\\nThe fight against terrorism cannot be won solely\\nthrough the use of military and police means. We must\\nstrike at its roots, which spawn hate, brutality and the\\nsenseless destruction of human lives. The core of any\\nmultilateral system is the right of all peoples and every\\nhuman being to live in peace and dignity.\\nThe threat of weapons of mass destruction also\\nremains a concern of highest priority. While significant\\nprogress has been made, disturbing news has reached\\nus over the last few months from other regions of the\\nglobe, in particular from Iran and from the Democratic\\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. In each of these cases, the\\nnecessary clarifications and full guarantees must be\\nprovided, particularly within the framework of strict\\nrespect for the International Atomic Energy Agency\\n(IAEA) regimes. Here, I would like to emphasize that\\nthe 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons must provide an\\nopportunity for reaffirming the validity and relevance\\nof the shared quest for solutions to the complex issues\\nof non-proliferation.\\nRegarding all of these cases linked to the\\nmaintenance of peace and international security, the\\nUnited Nations will find a reliable and committed\\npartner in the European Union, which has made the\\nemergence of effective multilateralism one of its\\npriorities for the security strategy it adopted in\\nDecember 2003. It is, indeed, with pride that I add that\\nLuxembourg has also been shouldering its\\npeacekeeping responsibilities by contributing military\\ncontingents to the Kosovo Force and to the\\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan,\\nwhich are now under the command of the European\\nCorps.\\nThe issue of development is and must remain the\\nfocus of the international community’s attention. This\\nis the most important point in this context. While\\nmillions of human beings continue to live in\\nunacceptable conditions, our rallying around the\\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\\nmust be constant and indeed stepped up, given the fact\\nthat many States, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,\\nstill experience extreme difficulty in making progress\\nto meet the 2015 deadline.\\nFor its part, Luxembourg is ready to shoulder its\\nduties in the indispensable joint international efforts. In\\n2003, our official development assistance (ODA) in\\nLuxembourg reached 0.81 per cent of our gross\\nnational product and the goal of having this figure\\nreach one per cent in the years to come is part of the\\nprogramme of the new Government that was formed in\\nJuly of this year. The struggle against poverty and the\\ncommitment to sustainable development on the global\\nlevel are also major objectives of the policy of\\ncooperation in Luxembourg, the policy that we are\\nimplementing together with our partners in a spirit of\\npartnership and participation. In our actions to ensure\\ncooperation, particular emphasis must be placed on the\\ncontinuation of international efforts targeting\\nreproductive health, in particular, combating the\\nhorrendous scourge of HIV/AIDS.\\nIn addition to an increase in ODA on the global\\nscale, other sources of financing can be used, and the\\ninitiative of Presidents Lula and Chirac has charted the\\nway for a number of interesting ideas in this respect.\\nWe believe that it is critical to maintain the Monterrey\\nConsensus as a whole. Any effective development\\n16\\n\\nstrategy in the medium- and long-term must be based\\non a proper combination of elements such as ODA,\\ninternational trade, direct foreign investment and the\\ndomestic efforts of the countries involved, particularly\\nregarding capacity reinforcement, strengthening of\\ngovernance and the rule of law. In this regard, I am\\nconvinced that all efforts must be further developed to\\nachieve a positive conclusion to the Doha development\\nround.\\nAs Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration,\\nI must mention an innovation in our national political\\ncontext, as did our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\\non 29 January 2004, in an inciteful speech to the\\nEuropean Parliament in Brussels regarding the growing\\nimportance of the problem of migration, particularly\\nfor Europe. This issue must be addressed through a\\ncareful management of migration flows by focusing on\\nintegration and international cooperation. Decisive\\naction against organized crime, in particular crime\\nlinked to any kind of trafficking in human beings, is an\\nindispensable corollary to this.\\nWe are called upon to step up our efforts during\\nthe year to come to prepare for a significant event,\\nnamely, the September 2005 summit, and which, in\\nUnited Nations jargon, is being called the “major\\nevent”. Five years after the Millennium Summit, this\\nmeeting of the highest political leaders on the planet\\nshould provide an opportunity to define a new\\nsynthesis — a new global agenda — at the dawn of the\\ntwenty-first century.\\nIndeed, we face many significant challenges.\\nTogether, we must review all of the commitments\\nundertaken in the Millennium Declaration and at the\\nmajor conferences of the 1990s, assess their\\nimplementation and, within the Organization, make\\nany adjustments and adaptations that a changing global\\ncontext requires — all without compromising the level\\nof the shared ambitions that inspire us. We must see to\\nit that the new global agenda expresses the hopes and\\naspirations of the entire international community. In\\nparticular, development must continue to be a focus of\\nthe attention it deserves. There is also a need to open\\nour Organization up to the new debates and the new\\nissues that are emerging in the area of the maintenance\\nof peace and security.\\nNone of the foregoing issues are fiefdoms of a\\nparticular State or group of States. Rather, they are\\nconcerns shared by all Member States and, as such,\\nmust be managed jointly within the multilateral\\ninstitutions that form our common heritage. The\\nvitality and relevance of our Organization is the key to\\nthe effort to redefine the terms of the international\\nagenda by giving priority to the concepts of\\ninterdependence and solidarity. While the goals are\\nvital, the risks are significant, and, together, we must\\nchart a coordinated, inclusive and balanced path that\\nwill allow each and every one of us to participate fully\\nand to express our aspirations and expectations.\\nTo achieve those lofty goals we need, first of all,\\nto promote the development of a new mindset in our\\ndeliberations. After the divisions and controversies of\\nrecent years, the international community must once\\nagain come together and close ranks around shared,\\njoint objectives. In that way the United Nations will\\nremain the pre-eminent seat of international legitimacy\\nand a vital centre for multilateral action, as the\\nSecretary-General recently said. It is that new mindset\\nthat must inspire our shared activities as we move\\ntowards next year’s major event.\\nWe also need to agree on a procedure that will\\nensure the participation of all, guarantee the necessary\\nbalance among the various aspects of the process and\\nguide us towards greater coordination on the substance\\nof the political messages to be formulated. In all\\nevents, rest assured that my country and its partners in\\nthe European Union are ready to participate fully in\\nthat debate.\\nIn the context of a renewal of multilateralism, as I\\nhave tried to outline it here, reform of the United\\nNations has pride of place. Our institutions must be\\nbetter adapted to meet new challenges, as well as to\\nfulfil their present mandates. The genuine renewal of\\nthe United Nations system must be reflected in a\\npalpable strengthening of the tools for analysis,\\ndecision and action available to us. Effective\\nmultilateralism must be expressed through the\\nstrengthening of the United Nations system as a whole.\\nBy adopting a more global approach, we see\\nreform not as a zero-sum game, but as a positive-sum\\ngame, in which each player and each institution\\nbenefits from the new impetus thus provided.\\nSignificant progress was already made in the\\nrevitalization of the General Assembly during the fifty-\\neighth session, under the leadership of the former\\nPresident, Mr. Julian Hunte. Those efforts now remain\\n17\\n\\nto be translated into action as well as continued and\\nintensified.\\nSecurity Council reform, which has been in\\ndiscussion for more than a decade, must be carried out,\\nso that that vital body can better reflect the realities of\\ntoday’s world; indeed, it is both a prerequisite for the\\nCouncil’s legitimacy and a guarantee for the\\neffectiveness of its action. More active interaction\\nbetween the Security Council and the General\\nAssembly and a better coordination of their roles, as\\nwell as enhanced transparency regarding States not\\nmembers of the Security Council, should form the\\nframework of any future enlargement of the Council.\\nThe restructuring of the work of the Economic\\nand Social Council and the Main Committees of the\\nGeneral Assembly should be conducted with\\ndetermination and courage so that more focused and\\nbetter organized activities can gain greater relevance\\nand have greater political impact on the substantive\\nproblems being addressed.\\nThe strengthening of the rule of law on a global\\nscale, as called for by the Secretary-General, and, in\\nparticular, the consolidation and ultimate\\nuniversalization of the International Criminal Court,\\nshould be among our highest priorities, along with the\\nprotection of human rights — the vital importance of\\nwhich I would like to emphasize once again.\\nFinally, I would be remiss were I to fail to\\nmention the Secretariat staff and other United Nations\\npersonnel, who are carrying out an extraordinarily\\ndifficult mission with courage and dedication, and\\nindeed sometimes, as we know, risking their very lives.\\nIt is crucial that we be able, within the framework of\\nthis year’s budgetary discussions for the year, to\\nprovide the Organization with the resources,\\nparticularly the financial resources to fulfil the\\nmandates that we have conferred upon it, especially in\\nregard to peacekeeping operations. It is also vital that\\nthe Organization adopt a rigorous policy regarding the\\nprotection of United Nations personnel, who are acting\\non our behalf in often dangerous conditions in all\\ncorners of the globe.\\nIt seems that to put a curse on someone, one has\\nonly to wish for them to live in interesting times. I do\\nnot know if we are living under a curse, but I do know\\nthat we are living in an interesting time: a time of\\ndebate, a time of restructuring, a time of choice and of\\nthe relaunching of international cooperation. Let us\\nseize this opportunity and breathe new life into the\\nUnited Nations, which has been proven itself to be\\nindispensable. But let us also admit that the choice of\\nmultilateralism is a demanding one, and one that\\nrequires of us all an increased readiness to call into\\nquestion our old certainties and to accept new\\napproaches within a renewed institutional framework.\\nOn the path towards that renewal, let us draw\\ninspiration from the magnificent lines of the Spanish\\npoet, Antonio Machado, and I quote:\\n“Traveller, your footsteps\\nAre the road, and nothing else;\\nTraveller, there is no road.\\nThe road is made by walking;\\nWalking makes the road”.\\nI am confident that together we will have the\\nvision and the courage to take that first step, and the\\nsteps that follow, on that ambitious path.', 'I would\\nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\\nelection. We are pleased that a man of your ability, a\\nFrancophone representative of a friendly country, is\\ndirecting our proceedings.\\nI also wish to warmly applaud our Secretary-\\nGeneral. We have heard his message on respect for the\\nrule of law. And through the Secretary-General, I wish to\\ncommend the entire staff of this institution, here and\\neverywhere in the world: their courage and commitment\\nare a credit to our ideals and to the organizations they\\nserve — sadly, sometimes at the cost of their own\\nlives.\\nHow are we to meet the challenges facing the\\nworld? That is the question we all keep asking\\nourselves, one after another, from this rostrum. And\\nhow are we to meet the world’s expectations unless we\\nall mobilize? More than ever, the United Nations\\nremains the one irreplaceable, legitimate framework\\nfor harnessing that mobilization and translating it into\\ncollective action.\\nWe have much to do: conflicts remain unresolved,\\nwhile others are breaking out; poverty is declining all too\\nslowly; people are destroyed by wars; refugees are torn\\nfrom their land; and the threat of terrorism is not\\nfading. Yes, we have much to do. Yes, we have a duty\\nto act, and an obligation never to give up.\\nThe United Nations is acting — on all fronts, on\\nthe front line. To resolve conflicts and prevent them\\nfrom flaring up again, it is present everywhere, on all\\ncontinents, in Haiti, Kosovo, the Democratic Republic\\nof the Congo, in Côte d’Ivoire, Afghanistan and many\\nother fronts, deploying over 50,000 Blue Helmets. It\\nprovides assistance to 17 million people protected by\\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees. Through the\\nWorld Food Programme, it feeds more than 100 million\\nindividuals. And it helps, especially through the United\\nNations Development Programme, 170 States or\\nterritories to develop.\\nUnited Nations activities — our activities —\\ncontinue to expand. Thus, the Organization is called\\nupon to be at the centre of the counter-terrorism\\nmeasures that the international community is putting in\\nplace. The threat of terrorism, now a global one,\\ncalling for a global response. That is why France\\ncommitted itself here to the fight, and did so again\\nrecently by supporting the strengthening of the\\nCounter-Terrorism Committee.\\nThe tragedy of 11 September, which I refer to\\nwith feeling here in New York City, was an attack on\\nus all. Since then, terrorism has continued to strike: in\\nEurope, in Madrid, six months ago; and in Asia, in Bali\\nand Jakarta. Cowardly attacks are mounted against the\\nweakest. How can we not be appalled at the tragedy of\\nthe school in Beslan where children — the symbol of\\ninnocence — were violently massacred?\\nWe are waging a merciless fight against\\nterrorism. Let us at the same time address its roots.\\nThat means putting an end to situations that terrorists\\nexploit; giving the world’s excluded hope again;\\nrestoring dignity to those peoples deprived of it; and\\nensuring that dialogue and cooperation among\\ncivilizations, cultures and religions prevail, rather than\\nconflict and intolerance.\\nGlobal threats require a strong, and always\\ncollective, response. The threat of proliferation, which\\n29\\n\\ncould merge with that of terrorism, calls for resolute\\nand sustained action. The non-proliferation regime has\\nbeen seriously undermined by the combined action of\\ncertain States and non-State actors. That is why\\nstrengthening existing instruments is today essential.\\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons (NPT) Review Conference in 2005 will be an\\nopportunity to do so.\\nA safer and freer world is, first, a more just\\nworld. That is why we must act relentlessly to resolve\\nconflicts. I am, of course, thinking, first and foremost,\\nof the Middle East, where — in the wake of the hopes\\nraised by Madrid, Oslo, Camp David and Taba — the\\nabsence of any prospect is today breeding despair,\\nextremism and violence of every kind. This central\\ncrisis can be resolved only through a negotiated\\nsettlement based on international law, enabling all the\\npeoples — I repeat, all the peoples — of the region to\\nlive in dignity and security.\\nThe road map, which the parties have accepted\\nand which the Security Council has endorsed, must be\\nimplemented in full and in good faith. France hopes\\nthat the withdrawal from Gaza is a first step in that\\ndirection. It will make every effort to get the peace\\nprocess under way again. It will continue to act vis-à-\\nvis all the leaders — the elected and legitimate\\nleaders — of that region.\\nLet us make no mistake: building peace in the\\nMiddle East is a historic responsibility for our\\ngeneration. Europe — the European Union — in\\npartnership with the United States, Russia and the\\nUnited Nations, is determined to play a political role in\\norder to stimulate this process.\\nIn Iraq, violence is exploding. It seems to us that\\nonly when the Iraqis themselves take control of their\\nfuture, and when the political process provided for by\\nthe Security Council is pursued, will the country be\\nable to escape the chaos that is destabilizing the entire\\nregion. France, as everyone knows, did not approve of\\nthe conditions in which the conflict was unleashed.\\nNeither today nor tomorrow will it commit itself\\nmilitarily in Iraq. However, it reaffirms its willingness,\\nwith its European partners, to assist the Iraqi people in\\nrebuilding their country and in restoring their\\ninstitutions.\\nWho can fail to see that, in the Middle East,\\neverything is fragile and everything is interconnected?\\nWho can fail to understand that the only path —\\neverywhere — is sovereignty and justice for peoples?\\nOnly then will they make progress towards peace and\\nthe economic and political modernization to which\\nthey are entitled.\\nAfrica, too, is where we will win or lose the battle\\nfor justice. Without justice, there will be no peace.\\nWithout peace, there will be no lasting development. The\\nfuture of the African continent, and its stability and\\ndevelopment, are a vital objective for us all.\\nToday, with the impetus of the United Nations,\\nlongstanding crises have been, or will be, settled —\\nMozambique, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Others,\\nhowever, have broken out, and together we must\\nprevent them from worsening or spreading: in Côte\\nd’Ivoire, the Central African Republic, and Darfur. The\\nGreat Lakes region is slow to find the path to peace,\\njust as the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is\\nslow to die, and the Somali question remains to be\\nresolved.\\nOn that great continent, which is undergoing\\nprofound change, facing real threats but also\\nconsiderable potential, political leaders are today\\ndemonstrating a genuine determination to commit to\\nworking to resolve conflicts and crises. That can be\\nseen from the implementation of the New Partnership\\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD); the resolute\\ncommitment of the African Union on the political front\\nand in the field; and the growing role of regional\\norganizations. We resolutely support that commitment.\\nFor development, but also for peace-building, we wish\\nto bring about the conditions for an effective and\\ncoherent partnership between North and South.\\nGiven the magnitude of the goals and needs of\\nthe continent, I firmly believe in the importance of\\npooling the efforts of the Europeans with those of our\\nAfrican partners, under United Nations auspices,\\nwhenever necessary. I am convinced that our\\nexperience of European integration — without\\nattempting to teach any lessons — can simply be useful\\nto that continent, and that is the sense of the statement\\nmade on our behalf by the representative of the\\npresidency of the European Union, Bernard Bot, before\\nthe Assembly the day before yesterday.\\nFrance has long been involved in strengthening\\nAfrican peacekeeping capacities. Today, the European\\nUnion intends to make a commitment immediately and\\nwith determination. Operation Artemis, in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, is proof of that\\n30\\n\\ncommitment. The creation of the European Peace\\nFacility now provides major support to African\\norganizations. We are willing, if the African Union so\\nwishes, to assist it in its action for peace, as in the\\nSudan.\\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti), Vice-President, took the\\nChair.\\nJustice and conflict prevention cannot be\\ndissociated from collective action to promote\\ndevelopment. The Millennium Goals — to which the\\ndeveloping countries, donor States and multilateral\\ninstitutions are committed — are an overriding obligation\\nfor us all, especially the wealthiest countries.\\nMore than $50 billion a year is still needed to\\nachieve those objectives — a fact of which we all are\\naware. On Monday, 100-odd countries endorsed the\\nNew York Declaration on Action Against Hunger and\\nPoverty. Together they ask that additional resources be\\nprovided for development, including through\\ninnovative mechanisms. This is a powerful movement,\\nlaunched in this very forum of the United Nations,\\naimed at generating the necessary resources for justice\\nand for development. It is an important milestone. My\\ncountry is proud to have contributed to it, through the\\nvoice of the President of the Republic, and it will\\ncontinue to do so.\\nBut France is also fighting for a more controlled,\\nand therefore most just, globalization that would give\\neveryone a chance. We advocate the establishment of a\\npolitical body, in which the United Nations must have\\nits due place — to improve coordination of multilateral\\naction in the economic, social and environmental fields\\nand to provide the necessary impetus. This is one of the\\nmajor issues that we must consider in coming months,\\nespecially on the basis of the proposals that the Panel\\non reform is expected to make.\\nAgain, a more just world is a world that respects\\nhuman dignity and freedom. Fundamental human rights\\nare universal. Each man, woman and child has these\\ninherent rights, and it is up to us to see that they thrive\\nand are respected.\\nIt is also up to us to fight firmly and\\nuncompromisingly against all manifestations of violence\\nand discrimination based on race, origin, gender or\\nreligion. Our resolve in the area of human rights, as\\nelsewhere, must remain absolute and constant. I mean\\nthat we need a genuine dialogue with the civil society\\nand with all non-governmental organizations. The time\\nhas come, it seems to us, to conclude the negotiation of\\na conventional instrument on forced disappearances, to\\nrecognize the rights of indigenous peoples and to\\nmobilize against all forms of modern slavery.\\nLet us not rule out the use of force, in certain\\ncases and on the appeal of victims, to prevent massive\\nhuman rights violations and acts of violence against\\ncivilians. The Security Council has the honour of\\nassuming this responsibility, in accordance with the\\nUnited Nations Charter.\\nLet us also continue putting in place mechanisms\\nto combat impunity, often the prerequisite for durable\\npeace and lasting reconciliation. The establishment of\\nthe International Criminal Court specifically meets this\\nobjective. We welcome the major milestone reached\\nwith the entry into force of the Rome Statute.\\nThe dignity of humankind and peoples also\\nrequires due respect for cultures in their diversity. The\\nsense of loss of identity contributes to the frustrations\\nthat breed a good many conflicts. The unity of the\\ninternational community, it goes without saying, cannot\\nbe synonymous with uniformity.\\nThe negotiation of a convention on cultural\\ndiversity, which has just started at the United Nations\\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is,\\ntherefore, in our view, a key objective. It must produce\\na concrete result, as planned, before the 2005 general\\nconference.\\nOur planet is dangerous; it is also in danger. The\\nearth is showing signs of strain; we are not maintaining\\nit; in fact, we are plundering it; the climate is\\ndeteriorating. And yet, we should remember, scarcity\\nof resources has at all times been a factor in conflict.\\nFor the future of our children, we must act while there\\nis still time.\\nIs there among us, for that matter, one single issue\\nthat more obviously ignores borders than ecology and\\necological security and requires coordinated action —\\nthat is, multilateral action? International governance in\\nenvironmental matters is, it seems to us, inadequate\\ntoday. We must simplify and strengthen the existing\\ninternational regime on environmental issues, develop\\nmonitoring, and early warning expertise, and increase\\nfinancing, especially for developing countries.\\nLet us be clear-sighted. For the environment, as\\nfor so many other issues, prevention costs less than\\n31\\n\\ncure. In this regard, we hope the establishment of a\\nUnited Nations organization for the environment will\\nbe considered, based on the achievements of the United\\nNations Environment Programme. We propose that this\\ngreat undertaking, which is one of the Millennium Goals,\\nbe on the agenda of the September 2005 summit.\\nIn a world — our world — where 800 million\\npeople do not have enough to eat, where more financial\\nresources are devoted to weapons than to development,\\nwhere millions of men, women and children are forced\\nto leave their land to escape destitution or massacres, the\\ninternational community has a duty to act and to show\\nimagination. It is here at the United Nations where we\\ncan meet to take initiatives, to fight misfortune and to\\napportion the tasks, all of them urgent.\\nThe United Nations system, which is unique and\\nmore indispensable than ever, also has an obligation to\\nreform itself to meet new needs and new threats, and to\\nmake the most of new technologies merely in order to\\nlive in our times. The Secretary-General got down to\\nthis problem at the start of his first mandate.\\nConsiderable work has already been done. The\\nproposals of the high-level panel will be the basis for\\nthe next, still more ambitious, stages. France has made\\nproposals on many issues, such as peacekeeping\\noperations, human rights and development financing.\\nWe have also indicated, with Germany, how the\\nrepresentativity and legitimacy of Security Council\\naction might be improved. We advocate enlargement in\\nboth categories of members, permanent and non-\\npermanent; and we have expressed support for the\\naspirations of Germany, Japan, Brazil and India, which\\nshould be accompanied by a country from Africa.\\nIn a complex and unpredictable world, it is our\\njoint responsibility to maintain and strengthen the one\\ninstitution where all nations can work together, where\\nthey can unite to shape and control their common\\ndestiny. Through its legitimacy and ever-increasing\\neffectiveness, the United Nations must be the\\ninstrument of universal conscience for which it remains\\nthe crucible.', 'Belgium’s international commitment is rooted in the\\nconviction that initiatives taken at the global level can\\nmove forward only through dialogue and cooperation.\\nThe careful European building process taught us that.\\nThat is why Belgium firmly believes in the virtues of\\nmultilateralism. We are stronger standing together than\\nalone. By standing together, we benefit from greater\\nlegitimacy and therefore have better opportunities to\\nmake our voices heard.\\nThe challenges facing the United Nations have\\nthe virtue of being clear. As the Secretary-General has\\nsaid, the options that become available to the world\\nwill depend on the answers that we provide. The\\nOrganization’s credibility will continue to be judged by\\nits effectiveness and its results on the ground. We must\\nimprove and strengthen the United Nations apparatus.\\nWe fully support the Secretary-General’s efforts in this\\ndifficult task. At the same time, we believe that the\\nUnited Nations system should better reflect the new\\ninternational realities.\\nThe sustained commitment of the United Nations\\nis required if we are to find a definitive solution to the\\n42\\n\\ncrisis in the Great Lakes region. The conflict there has\\nalready cost millions of lives. We must not fail to\\nrespond; inaction would constitute negligence. While I\\ndo not underestimate the difficulties in this regard, I\\nam convinced that a solution can be found. I refuse to\\nbelieve, therefore, that the stabilization process is\\ndoomed to deadlock or failure. In order to find a\\nsolution, however, the international community must\\nshow that it can make a difference. In that regard, it is\\nencouraging to note how dedicated the Secretary-\\nGeneral is to his mission. For its part, Belgium will\\ncontinue to appeal to its European Union partners for a\\ncollective and committed involvement in the region.\\nIt is essential that stability and security be fully\\nestablished and guaranteed in the Democratic Republic\\nof the Congo. It is clear that the transition process must\\nbe successful. We in the international community\\ncannot emphasize enough that political leaders have\\nthe duty to make it succeed. Indeed, there is no\\nalternative to that process as a means of achieving\\npeace and development in the region.\\nNation-building is impossible as long as impunity\\nand insecurity exist. In that respect, the restructuring\\nand the integration of the army are essential, as is the\\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants.\\nBelgium is currently training almost 300 Congolese\\nsoldiers under its Train the Trainers programme.\\nIt is also essential that the International\\nCommittee to Accompany the Transition fully shoulder\\nits responsibilities. For its part, Belgium is committed\\nto taking an active part in the implementation of the\\ndeclaration adopted by the countries members of that\\nCommittee.\\nThe United Nations Organization Mission in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) is\\nplaying a crucial role, and Belgium attaches great\\nimportance to that. It is not only the credibility of the\\nUnited Nations that is at stake here, but — more\\nimportant — the future of an entire region. Belgium\\ntherefore supports a better targeted mandate for\\nMONUC, as well as a strengthening of its means.\\nWith our European partners, we are also\\nconsidering the best way of making a joint contribution\\nto that Mission. It goes without saying that the\\nelections scheduled for 2005 will be crucial. They will\\nrequire substantial human and financial means, to\\nwhich Belgium has already decided it will contribute.\\nWith regard to the situation in Rwanda, we offer\\nour full support to the praiseworthy efforts made to\\nachieve reconciliation. Normalized relations between\\nRwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\\nabsolutely indispensable and must be based on\\ncollaboration and good-neighbourly relations. This\\nimplies a mutual respect of the borders.\\nIn many regards, the latest developments in\\nBurundi are encouraging. A constitution has been\\nadopted, a referendum has been announced and an\\nelectoral commission is in place. Elections are\\nessential, of course, which is why Belgium has\\nprovided significant financial backing to their\\norganization. I urge the international community to\\nspecify without delay what resources it is ready to\\nmobilize for this purpose.\\nBelgium shares the concerns about the\\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur. There is no excuse for\\nthe persecution and systematic massacre of thousands\\nof human beings. Given the scale of the suffering, the\\nefforts and the progress made thus far remain\\ninsufficient. Belgium therefore insists on the swift\\nestablishment of an international commission of\\ninquiry.\\nThe situation in Iraq will continue to present a\\nconsiderable challenge over the coming months and\\neven years. I congratulate the United Nations for its\\ncontinued support to the Iraqi transition process,\\nespecially given the country’s climate of insecurity.\\nThe population of Iraq, which has already faced so\\nmany ordeals, must finally be able to live in peace. It\\nis, of course, the Iraqi people who must shoulder the\\nresponsibility of guiding the political process, a\\nprocess that must lead to the creation of a new\\nparliament, a new constitution and a sovereign\\nGovernment. This Government must be capable of\\nensuring the well-being of its citizens, as well as the\\ncountry’s security, with no external assistance. To date,\\nBelgium has allocated approximately €17 million to\\nthe reconstruction process and we will provide air\\ntransportation for the United Nations Assistance\\nMission for Iraq (UNAMI) personnel between Amman\\nand Baghdad.\\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nposes a serious threat to world security. The regime of\\nnon-proliferation is jeopardized by an alarming\\nsituation; the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\\nmust regain its place within this regime without delay.\\n43\\n\\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is located in a region full\\nof tensions, and its security concerns are legitimate.\\nThe international community should therefore take this\\ninto account in its approach to the problem. And the\\nIranian authorities must cooperate entirely with the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and cease all\\nactivities linked to the enrichment of uranium. By so\\ndoing, Iran will contribute significantly to the\\nstabilization and prosperity of the region.\\nThe tragedy in Beslan has proved once again that\\nterrorism attacks blindly. It goes without saying that no\\nform of terrorism is justifiable. The indignation and\\nanalysis that such acts may provoke can in no way vary\\naccording to the victim, the location, the aggressor or\\nthe circumstances. Appropriate military means and\\nsecurity measures will remain necessary in order to\\nfight terrorism, but means other than strictly military\\nones are also required. Indeed, the environment in\\nwhich terrorism thrives is comprised of ideological,\\nsocio-economic, political and other variables.\\nThis is why I plead for a dialogue between the\\nWest and the Arab and Muslim world, involving not\\nonly political leaders but also spiritual leaders, and not\\nas a mere exchange of ideas or points of view, but in\\norder to identify the instruments that could deny such\\nbarbarous acts all legitimacy and raison d’être, with a\\nview to finally bringing this appalling logic of death to\\na halt.', \"I should like to\\nbegin by congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on his election\\nas President of the fifty-ninth session of the General\\nAssembly. He may be sure that Austria will fully\\nsupport him in carrying out his important task.\\nI fully subscribe to the statement made by the\\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on\\nbehalf of the European Union, which expressed the\\nposition of the European Union regarding the various\\nglobal and regional challenges we face today. I would\\nlike to emphasize a few additional points from our own\\nperspective.\\nOver the past few years we have had to reassess\\nkey concepts of our national and international security\\nenvironment. With the emergence of new and complex\\nthreats, in particular terrorism in combination with the\\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the\\ninternational community faces unprecedented\\nchallenges for which it has to find legitimate\\nresponses. Just recently, we witnessed the horrifying\\nterrorist attack against innocent school children in\\nBeslan. This was only the last of a whole series of\\nheinous attacks in all regions of the world targeted\\nagainst innocents.\\nAustria is committed to full cooperation with\\nother States and United Nations bodies involved in\\ncounter-terrorism and is working to promote the whole\\nrange of United Nations action against terrorism. In\\nVienna, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\\nand its Terrorism Prevention Branch make an important\\ncontribution by rendering assistance to Member States\\nin implementing national legislation required by\\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and in\\nbuilding their national capacity to do so.\\nAustria is convinced that only effective\\nmultilateralism based on the rule of law can address the\\nnew and complex challenges that the international\\ncommunity faces today. We support the efforts of the\\nQuartet in the Middle East peace process, and we urge\\nIsrael and the Palestinians to implement their\\nrespective obligations. The road map remains the only\\nway forward towards a just, comprehensive and lasting\\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict leading to two\\nStates living side by side in peace and security.\\nThe United Nations continues to play a key role\\nin South-Eastern Europe, especially in Kosovo. We\\nwelcome the recent appointment of Mr. Soren Jessen-\\nPetersen as Special Representative for Kosovo. In that\\nregard, within the European Union, the countries of the\\nregional partnership ó the Czech Republic, Hungary,\\nPoland, Slovakia, Slovenia and my country, Austria ó\\npresented concrete proposals with regard to security,\\neconomic development, decentralization and the\\nprotection of minorities and of religious sites. We are\\nconfident that they can contribute to progress in\\nKosovo.\\nInternational and regional efforts are essential if\\nwe are to contain and resolve the various conflicts in\\n28\\n\\nother regions of the world. The dramatic situation in\\nDarfur highlights the need for better harmonization of the\\ninternational efforts of the United Nations, the African\\nUnion, the EU, the League of Arab States, the United\\nStates and other actors. We will have to examine\\ncarefully the results of the current mission to Darfur of\\nthe new Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide\\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\\nSuch missions and mechanisms are indeed the\\ntools that the United Nations needs if it is to effectively\\naddress emerging crisis situations. Strengthening the\\nrule of law, human rights, democratic participation and\\neconomic development will reduce the chance of\\nconflicts within societies and among States turning\\nviolent. In order to be a credible player, the United\\nNations must be given the necessary institutional\\nframework to enact effective strategies at all stages of\\na conflict.\\nAustria therefore welcomed the Secretary-\\nGeneralís call for reform, in particular his initiative to\\nestablish a High-Level Panel of eminent persons to\\npropose specific measures for institutional innovation\\nby the end of the year. I was happy to meet with the\\nmembers of the Panel when it held its meeting in\\nAustria earlier this year.\\nOne item on the Panel's agenda is Security\\nCouncil reform. Austria, like many other countries, is\\nconcerned about the growing gap between the\\nCouncilís current composition on the one hand, and the\\nchanging political, economic and social reality of the\\ncommunity of nations on the other.\\nIt is essential to enlarge and balance the\\nmembership of the Security Council, as well as to\\nincrease its transparency. In order for all peoples to\\nidentify with its decisions, we must ensure that the\\nSecurity Council is a body that truly reflects the\\ndiversity of the world's cultures and regions by an\\nimproved representation of regions such as Africa,\\nAsia and Latin America.\\nAs you know, Sir, it is my personal vision that, in\\nthe longer term, the European Union should also be\\nrepresented in the Security Council. I pointed out\\nduring the general debate last year that that would be\\nthe logical consequence of further European integration\\nin the field of common foreign and security policy.\\nThe United Nations has been at the centre of\\nAustriaís foreign policy since we became a Member\\nafter regaining our full independence in 1955. We have\\nalways strongly supported the principles and purposes\\nof the United Nations, and we remain committed to the\\ngoals of the Charter.\\nAustria feels honoured and privileged to host one\\nof the headquarters of the United Nations. This year,\\nwe celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening\\nof the Vienna International Centre, home to many United\\nNations institutions. The work of the International\\nAtomic Energy Agency and the Preparatory Committee\\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\\nOrganization with respect to nuclear non-proliferation;\\nthe work of the United Nations Industrial Development\\nOrganization on development cooperation; and the\\nfight against the so-called uncivil society by the United\\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, contribute\\nsubstantially to the international communityís efforts to\\nconfront the worldís new security threats.\\nIn this spirit of full and honest commitment to the\\nUnited Nations, I would like to recall that Austria is a\\ncandidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security\\nCouncil for the term 2009-2010. Our candidature,\\nannounced over five years ago - in 1999 - is based\\non our willingness to contribute actively and\\nconstructively to the maintenance of international\\npeace and security. We fully recognize the heavy\\nresponsibility which Security Council membership\\nentails and we are ready to assume it.\\nOver the past 50 years, Austria has sought to\\ncontribute effectively to the work of the United Nations,\\nin particular in the fields of peace and security, human\\nrights, development, disarmament and international\\nlaw. We are a significant contributor to United Nations\\npeacekeeping operations and have traditionally been\\namong the largest European troop contributors. Since\\n1963, over 50,000 Austrians have served in more than\\n50 United Nations missions worldwide.\\nSecurity, as we see it, means human security. It is\\nthe kind of security that all human beings are looking\\nfor, among them millions of civilians in all parts of the\\nworld affected by armed conflict ó the majority of\\nthem women and children ó and 40 million people\\nliving with the HIV virus. Human security transcends\\nthe concept of hard threats and soft threats. If we see\\nthose threats through the prism of the human beings\\nconcerned, it becomes clear that for the afflicted\\nindividual, all such threats - war, hunger, terrorism or\\ndeadly disease - deprive them of their security.\\n29\\n\\nAustria is honoured to chair the first Review\\nConference of States Parties to the Anti-personnel\\nMine-Ban Convention in Nairobi later this year, where\\nthe international community will chart a course for the\\nsolution of the landmine problem in the coming years.\\nThe Mine-Ban Convention has become a true example\\nof a successful and effective multilateral approach to\\naddress a global problem. I encourage all States to\\nparticipate at the Nairobi Summit at the highest\\npossible level.\\nAs a member of the Human Security Network, we\\ncooperate with others to promote human security in the\\nworld. To provide one concrete example, Austria -\\ntogether with Slovenia and Jordan ó initiated and\\nfunded an aid project for traumatized children in Iraq. I\\nam convinced that applying a human security\\nperspective to international problems has the potential\\nof preventing or resolving conflict and promoting\\npeace and development.\\nWe also need to reflect further on how best to\\nensure respect for human rights during conflict, how to\\nincorporate human rights into preventive policies and\\nhow to formulate post-conflict strategies likely to\\nachieve lasting reconciliation and build a firm basis for\\nthe rule of law and good governance. In that respect,\\nhuman rights education is an important element in\\ngetting to the root of conflict and breaking the vicious\\ncircle of human rights violations.\\nViolence between ethnic groups and religious\\ncommunities has shaken countries across the globe. In\\nparticular, the disregard for the needs and the rights of\\nminorities tends to fuel violent conflict. Our\\nendeavours for the protection of the rights of minorities\\nare still highly needed, not the least to ensure that\\nethnic cleansing or genocide will never happen again.\\nWe know that the Secretary-General feels very strongly\\nabout the need for speed of action to prevent the most\\nheinous crimes. I share his concerns.\\nThe Austrian Government is convinced that it is\\nan essential responsibility of the United Nations and its\\nMember States to address the root causes of conflict.\\nGlobal poverty, inequality, competition for scarce\\nresources, environmental degradation and the spread of\\ninfectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, are among the\\ningredients that fuel the outbreak of conflicts both\\nwithin countries and among States.\\nThe Austrian Development Policy has placed a\\nparticular focus on poverty reduction, maintenance of\\npeace and the protection of the environment. I am\\npleased to inform the Assembly that Austria has\\nincreased its development aid by 35 per cent this year.\\nIn the area of environment and sustainable energy, we\\nhave initiated and promoted the Global Forum for\\nSustainable Energy, which aims at providing access to\\nenergy for people in developing countries. We consider\\nissues such as climate change, the decline of\\nbiodiversity and other forms of environmental\\ndegradation as essential aspects of our comprehensive\\nsecurity agenda.\\nLet me finally highlight an issue which the\\nSecretary-General made a central theme of his address\\nto the General Assembly. The key guarantee for\\ncreating and maintaining peace and security in the\\nworld has been and will continue to be an international\\nsystem based on the rule of law. This was the very idea\\nof the founders of the United Nations.\\nI particularly welcome the Secretary-General's\\npledge two days ago that he will make the United\\nNations work to strengthen the rule of law and\\ntransitional justice in conflict and post-conflict\\nsocieties a priority for the remainder of his tenure.\\nParticularly for smaller and medium sized countries, an\\ninternational order based on the rule of law is of\\nparamount importance.\\nWith this in mind, I would like to announce today\\nthat I have launched a discourse on the role and\\nfunction of the Security Council in strengthening a\\nrules-based international system. As a first step, we\\nwill organize in November a panel of international\\nlegal experts during International Law Week at\\nHeadquarters, which will analyse the increasing law-\\nmaking tendency of the Security Council.\\nThis is my last speech as Austrian Foreign\\nMinister. As you may know, I have been nominated\\nCommissioner of the European Union for External\\nRelations and European Neighbourhood Policy. This\\nfunction will, of course, keep me in close contact with\\nmany Assembly delegates and with the United Nations.\\nI would therefore like to use this opportunity today to\\nthank all colleagues, members of delegations and, in\\nparticular, the Secretariat, in which I myself had the\\nhonour to work, for the support that has been extended\\nto me and my staff here in New York over the past\\nyears. A special and warm expression of gratitude and\\nrespect goes to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. To the\\nPresident of the Assembly, I would like to extend my\\n30\\n\\nbest wishes for a successful and constructive fifty-\\nninth session of the General Assembly.\", 'It is an honour for me to\\naddress the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly\\nof the United Nations on behalf of the European Union\\n(EU).\\nWith its 25 member States, the European Union\\nrepresents 13 per cent of the United Nations\\nmembership and accounts for almost 30 percent of the\\nworld’s economy. Our contributions to the United\\nNations go further; EU member States pay more than\\n36 per cent of the United Nations regular budget and\\nabout half of all voluntary contributions to the United\\nNations Funds and Programmes. They contribute more\\nthan 50,000 troops to United Nations-led and United\\nNations-authorized international peace missions.\\nWe in the EU are proud of our contribution to the\\nUnited Nations and to international cooperation. But\\nwe are not complacent. We understand that our security\\nand prosperity are inextricably linked to the fate of\\nothers, and we know that we cannot isolate ourselves\\nfrom cross-border threats and challenges. We realize\\nthat climate change does not respect nationality,\\nethnicity or religion, that HIV/AIDS knows no borders\\nand that terrorists kill indiscriminately. No nation can\\nrespond to these threats in isolation; the only way\\nforward is through collective action.\\nIn a world of global threats, global markets and\\nglobal media, our security and prosperity depend more\\n28\\n\\nand more on an effective multilateral system. The\\nsearch for a strong, rule-based international society is\\nmore imperative than ever.\\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s call to work\\nharder to strengthen the rule of law for all. His agenda\\nis our agenda. That is why reform of the United\\nNations, with a view to making it stronger, more\\neffective and more efficient, is a high priority for the\\nEuropean Union. The Union remains committed to\\nmultilateralism and a rule-based international order,\\nwith the United Nations at its core. What gives great\\nstrength to the United Nations is its legitimacy. It has\\nno substitute in the international community. It is\\nunique. But the Organization must adapt to changing\\ncircumstances. The reform efforts that have already\\nbeen set in motion by the Secretary-General must be\\nintensified and deepened with a view to making the\\nUnited Nations stronger, more effective and more\\nefficient.\\nThe EU looks forward to the report of the High-\\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and to\\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendations that will be\\nsubmitted to the General Assembly. Next year, the\\nGeneral Assembly will meet at the highest level to\\nreview progress in honouring all of the commitments\\nof the United Nations Millennium Declaration. The\\nreview must be comprehensive, balanced and effective.\\nThe summit must deal with the major, interlinked,\\nconcerns of peace, security, poverty and sustainable\\ndevelopment. The recommendations in the report of the\\nWorld Commission on the Social Dimension of\\nGlobalization are an important contribution to the\\nreview.\\nWe have committed ourselves to combating\\npoverty and promoting sustainable development. The\\nMillennium Development Goals must be achieved.\\nUrgent action is called for. Both developing and\\ndeveloped countries must put in place a range of\\nmeasures, as agreed at the Monterrey Conference on\\nFinancing for Development including: good\\ngovernance; expansion of trade opportunities, in\\nparticular for developing countries; and an increase in\\nofficial development assistance. The European Union\\nis committed to those objectives. It is very much on\\ntrack for increasing its official development assistance\\n(ODA) to 0.39 per cent of gross national product\\n(GNP) in 2006 as part of a longer-term effort to raise\\nits ODA contributions to 0.7 per cent of GNP.\\nCombating HIV/AIDS must be an integral part of\\nour global campaign against poverty. As one of the\\nmost devastating pandemics in human history,\\nHIV/AIDS is literally a disease of mass destruction: a\\ndisease which strikes 10 people every minute. In Africa\\nespecially, AIDS is tearing the fabric of society apart.\\nFighting that disaster is a priority for us all.\\nPrevention of HIV/AIDS is inextricably linked to\\nsexual and reproductive health and rights. We wish to\\nreaffirm our commitment to the agenda of the\\nInternational Conference on Population and\\nDevelopment and will do so again at the tenth\\nanniversary commemoration on 14 October.\\nReproductive health and rights are an essential part of\\ndevelopment.\\nOne of the greatest threats to international peace\\nand security today is the proliferation of weapons of\\nmass destruction and their means of delivery. The\\ninternational community must address that challenge\\neffectively. The EU adopted a comprehensive and\\ncoherent strategy against the proliferation of those\\nweapons last December, covering a wide spectrum of\\nmeasures. The EU is guided by the conviction that a\\nmultilateral approach to security is the best way to\\nmaintain international order. That is why we are firmly\\ncommitted to uphold, implement and strengthen\\nmultilateral disarmament and non-proliferation treaties\\nand agreements. The multilateral treaty system\\nprovides the legal and normative basis for all non-\\nproliferation efforts.\\nInternational treaty regimes and export control\\narrangements are in place to prevent the spread of\\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery\\nsystems. Those instruments, however, have not\\nsucceeded in putting a complete stop to proliferation.\\nAdditional measures are necessary, in particular to\\ncombat the risk of terrorist organizations gaining\\naccess to those weapons and delivery systems. In that\\nregard, the EU welcomes the adoption of Security\\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004), which is fully in line\\nwith the EU strategy.\\nWith others, the European Union will also\\nexplore the possibility of establishing a close\\nrelationship between the United Nations and the Hague\\nInternational Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile\\nProliferation.\\nTerrorism is another threat that can be dealt with\\nonly by effective multilateralism and close\\n29\\n\\ninternational cooperation. Terrorists’ capacity to strike\\nis still very substantial, as shown by the heinous\\nattacks in several countries over the past year. I wish to\\nreiterate that the European Union utterly condemns all\\nterrorist acts, irrespective of their alleged motivations,\\nand to express our profound solidarity with the victims\\nof such acts.\\nThe European Union welcomes the development\\nof the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, which\\nwill strengthen the ability of the United Nations to\\noversee implementation of anti-terrorism resolutions\\nand conventions. Obviously, the United Nations can do\\nits work well only if Member States honour their\\ncommitments and assume their responsibilities.\\nEquipping the United Nations to deal with terrorism\\nalso demands readiness to act in situations in which\\nStates cannot or do not wish to implement their\\ninternational obligations in the fight against terrorism.\\nThis brings me to the issue of human rights —\\nanother common concern. Human rights lie at the core\\nof the work of the United Nations. The European\\nUnion fully agrees with Secretary-General Annan’s\\nstatement that terrorism must not be used as an excuse\\nto trample on human rights. States must ensure that any\\nmeasures taken to combat terrorism comply with their\\nobligations under international law, in particular\\ninternational human rights, refugee and humanitarian\\nlaw. We must protect the universal values and\\nfundamental freedoms whose enjoyment is seriously\\nimpaired by acts of terrorism.\\nThe European Union is a committed supporter of\\ninitiatives to improve the implementation of human\\nrights obligations worldwide and at country level. The\\nEuropean Union recognizes the responsibility of the\\ninternational community to protect mankind from\\ngenocide, war crimes and grave and massive violations\\nof human rights. The European Union welcomes the\\nintroduction of a human rights-based approach in the\\nwork of all United Nations agencies and programmes.\\nThat will ensure that United Nations assistance\\nactivities contribute to achieving such rights for\\neveryone everywhere. Our own initiatives in that area\\noften complement and strengthen those initiated within\\nthe United Nations framework. We especially welcome\\nthe close cooperation between the European Union and\\nthe United Nations special mechanism in respect of\\nchildren in armed conflict and human rights defenders.\\nThe valuable work being done by the United\\nNations, particularly by the Special Rapporteur on\\ntorture, in pursuit of the prevention and eradication of\\nall forms of torture, is strongly recommended and\\nsupported by the EU. The European Union would also\\nlike to take this opportunity to reaffirm its opposition\\nto the death penalty.\\nThe European Union stresses the importance of\\nthe International Criminal Court in putting an end to\\nimpunity and strengthening the rule of law throughout\\nthe world. It will pursue its efforts to ensure the widest\\npossible ratification of, and accession to, the Rome\\nStatute of the International Criminal Court.\\nThe world needs a United Nations that can\\nintervene decisively to prevent, limit and put an end to\\nmilitary conflicts. An estimated 40 per cent of\\ncountries emerging from civil wars relapse into conflict\\nwithin five years. The lesson — familiar but often\\nforgotten — is that the United Nations system must be\\nbetter attuned to how such conflicts can be prevented\\nand peace preserved. No matter how difficult,\\npreventing conflict and preserving a precarious peace\\nis less costly than intervening in a full-blown conflict.\\nThe European Union is aware of its responsibility\\nin that area and is increasing its capabilities to maintain\\nits already significant contribution to conflict\\nprevention, international crisis management and\\npeacekeeping operations. It will also continue to assist\\nother regional organizations to enhance their own crisis\\nmanagement capabilities. The United Nations must\\nintensify its cooperation with those organizations, in\\npart with a view to enhancing their capacity for crisis\\nmanagement, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the\\nCharter. To that end, the European Union is working\\nwith the United Nations Secretariat to implement the\\nJoint Declaration on United Nations-EU Cooperation\\nin Crisis Management of September 2003.\\nSeveral regional issues warrant special attention.\\nThe Middle East peace process must be put back on\\ntrack. That means that the entire international\\ncommunity must back the road map — the only road to\\nan agreed negotiated two-State solution. The European\\nUnion and its Quartet partners will remain engaged in\\nthe search for a settlement. The European Union thinks\\nthat the Assembly can make an important contribution\\nto that objective by focusing on substantive issues in\\nthe peace process and adopting a pragmatic and\\nconstructive approach towards this problem.\\n30\\n\\nThe Security Council’s unanimous adoption of\\nresolution 1546 (2004) marks the restoration of\\nsovereignty to Iraq. The European Union\\nwholeheartedly supports the political process and the\\nnew Iraqi Interim Government and calls on all Member\\nStates to do the same. It gives its full backing to the\\nholding of democratic elections in January 2005. It is\\ncommitted to unwavering support of the pivotal United\\nNations role in that country. The Iraqi people have\\nsuffered so much and deserve the chance to have a\\nbetter life. Let us offer them that chance.\\nIn a similar vein, the process of securing stability,\\nreconstruction and democratization in Afghanistan\\nmust remain an international priority. The Afghans are\\ndesperate for peace. They demand a say in their\\ncountry’s future. Over 10 million Afghans, more than\\n40 per cent of them women, have registered to vote in\\nthe presidential elections on 9 October. There can be\\nno better sign of their enthusiasm for democracy. The\\nEuropean Union will continue its political and financial\\nassistance to Afghanistan and its people.\\nDevelopments in Africa are cause for both\\noptimism and concern. Increasingly, Africans are\\ntaking responsibility for solving the problems of their\\ncontinent. The progress of the African Union in\\nestablishing its architecture for peace and security is a\\ncase in point. The European Union will use its African\\nPeace Facility to help the African Union build capacity\\nto engage in peace support and peacekeeping\\noperations.\\nThe European Union will closely cooperate with\\nthe African Union, the United Nations, the Arab\\nLeague and the United States with a view to\\nharmonizing international efforts to contain and\\nresolve the conflict in Darfur. It will continue to\\nsupport the efforts of the United Nations, in particular\\nby the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.\\nThe European Union expresses its concern over\\nthe recent increase in tensions in the Great Lakes\\nregion and calls on all countries in the region to adhere\\nto the Declaration of Principles on Good-Neighbourly\\nRelations and Cooperation. It remains our conviction\\nthat the resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakes\\nregion requires a regional approach. In the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo, the European Union supports a\\nmore focused and robust mandate of the United\\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC) and related\\nincreased capabilities. It is actively examining different\\noptions for continued support to United Nations efforts\\nto strengthen MONUC.\\nAlso, the European Union remains deeply\\nconcerned about the situation in Zimbabwe and urges\\nthat the Government of Zimbabwe establish the\\nconditions for and hold free and fair elections in line\\nwith the Southern African Development Community’s\\n(SADC) August 2004 electoral guidelines.\\nMany courageous men and women are trying to\\nmake a difference under the blue flag of the United\\nNations. Last year’s bombing in Baghdad was a tragic\\ndemonstration of the fact that the work of the United\\nNations is often dangerous. The European Union\\nsupports the Secretary-General’s efforts to improve the\\nsafety and security of United Nations staff. We are\\nkeen to discuss his proposals. Through our policies,\\nactions, and resources, we, the Member States, bear the\\nresponsibility of making it possible for the United\\nNations to go where it should.\\nThe European Union itself is an example of\\nmultilateralism at work. Conflicting interests and\\ndiverging views still exist within the European Union,\\nas they do everywhere. But conflicts are resolved\\nwithin the framework of common institutions and\\nbinding rules. Multilateralism works. A rule-based\\ninternational order is possible. And necessary. The\\nEuropean Union will strive to achieve that goal\\neverywhere.', 'Let me first\\nof all congratulate you, President Ping, on your\\nelection and wish you every success in your\\nresponsible post, and express my sincere thanks to the\\noutgoing President for his dedicated work.\\nI endorse the statement of the Netherlands\\nEuropean Union presidency.\\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the world\\nis changing at dramatic speed. In just a few decades,\\nhumanity will have reached the 8 billion mark. With\\nthe networking of world trade and with global\\ncommunication technologies, we are growing ever closer.\\nWe are going to become increasingly interdependent in\\neconomic, technical and ecological terms.\\nAt the same time, we all face a host of new\\nchallenges and new dangers which threaten us all —\\nthe South and the North, the developing and the\\ndeveloped world alike.\\nOn the one hand, there are threats to national and\\nglobal security such as the proliferation of weapons of\\nmass destruction, the nuclear threat, the danger posed\\nby failed States or, as we all painfully remember in this\\ncity, by terrorism, which does not respect humankind\\nor human dignity.\\nOn the other hand, there are also so-called soft\\nthreats, such as far-reaching environmental and\\nclimatic changes, poverty, major shortfalls in education\\nand training and the negative aspects of globalization,\\nrefugee flows, and diseases and epidemics such as\\nHIV/AIDS and malaria. They are a threat to security\\nand stability and take a heavy toll.\\nThe two — hard and soft threats — are closely\\nconnected. After all, we know that the causes of war\\nand violence, poverty, need and oppression are\\nmultifaceted and deep-rooted. We also know that crises\\nare the fruit of poverty and a sense of hopelessness,\\nand vice-versa. We will have no peace without\\ndevelopment, nor indeed development without peace,\\nso we have comprehensively to secure peace and\\nstability — above all through economic and social\\ndevelopment.\\nThe States of the world have to work together to\\nshape economic, technological and ecological\\nglobalization and rise to the resulting challenges. They\\nwill not be able to do so without close cooperation.\\nIndeed, that is now beyond the tools of traditional\\ndiplomacy alone. Their ability to secure and stabilize\\nthe international system on their own will in future\\nprove less and less adequate.\\nWhat we need is a far-reaching reform of the\\ninternational system and its institutions that takes due\\naccount of these changes. That is a reform we need\\nurgently, because we have to create an effective\\nmultilateral system which enables us to work together\\nto prevent crises and, where that does not work, find\\nlong-term solutions.\\nThere have already been promising developments\\nat the regional level. With their sometimes painful history\\nvery much in mind, the States of Europe have joined\\ntogether in the European Union and thus have reached\\na new level of multilateralism. This political and\\neconomic community, now embracing 25 States, has\\nbecome an anchor of stability for Europe and beyond.\\nSince its foundation the African Union has been\\nimpressively shouldering its shared responsibility for\\npreventing humanitarian disasters and resolving major\\nregional conflicts. This is a courageous and key step\\nforward. This breakthrough of multilateralism on the\\nAfrican continent will develop an ever more\\npronounced dynamism.\\nGiven global interdependencies and connections,\\nwe need a world organization that has close links to\\nthese regional structures and can thus boost the\\nefficiency of joint action. The United Nations is the\\nmost important forum for setting global rules. Its might\\nis the might of the right, as the Secretary-General\\nhighlighted in his impressive speech at the opening of\\nthis General Assembly session. With its legitimacy we\\nhave a unique and universal competence for solving\\nproblems together. Since the breaking of the internal\\nblockade caused by the cold war, the United Nations\\nhas been playing an increasingly significant role. The\\ninternational community is making more and more use\\nof it as a forum for tackling the major challenges\\nfacing humanity.\\nFor millions of people today the Blue Flag means\\nquite tangible help, often on essential issues, and hope\\nfor a better future. For this, we are all very much\\nindebted to the Organization and its staff. They are on\\nthe ground in many crisis regions in Latin America,\\nEurope, Africa and Asia.\\nIt is becoming ever clearer that different\\napproaches must be found to prevent or resolve each\\n17\\n\\nindividual crisis. The commitment of the United\\nNations in all crisis areas is the proof. In Afghanistan\\nand in the Balkans, in Haiti and in the Great Lakes\\nregion the United Nations is already making a\\nconsiderable contribution. But we must realize that\\nthere will not be fewer conflicts in the future, and the\\ndemands made of the Organization will grow.\\nAgainst this backdrop the question arises whether\\nthe structures given to the United Nations at its\\nfoundation almost sixty years ago are still suited to this\\nmandate, whether its work enjoys the international\\nacceptance it needs. In particular, the disputes\\nconcerning the Iraq crisis highlighted this problem\\nonce again.\\nWe are convinced there is no alternative to a\\nworld acting multilaterally. To make this multilateral\\ncooperation sustainable and capable, we need a\\ncourageous and comprehensive reform of the United\\nNations that faces up to the challenges we are facing.\\nIt was the Secretary-General himself who took\\nthe initiative, and for this we extend our thanks. To that\\nend, he appointed a panel of high-level international\\nexperts who are to present him with reform proposals\\nat the end of the year. We look forward to that report\\nand the ensuing debate with great interest.\\nWhat is at stake is a new, shared understanding of\\nthe Charter system. How can we shape prevention to\\nmake it more effective, and peace-building to make it\\nmore sustainable? How can we further implement the\\nproposals on the reform of peacekeeping? What exactly\\ndo we understand by the right of self-defence? How do\\nwe define terrorism? The answer to this question in\\nparticular seems clear, yet real agreement would take us,\\nthe international community of States, a step forward.\\nA number of very concrete proposals on the\\nreform of the United Nations institutions have already\\nbeen presented. Let me therefore outline some thoughts\\non this matter.\\nI want to start with the General Assembly. It is\\nthe central organ of the United Nations, the only one\\nwith universal membership. For this very reason, the\\nAssembly has to be more than an annual forum where\\nwe just go through the motions. What we need to do\\nfirst is focus our topics more carefully. We have to\\ndiscuss the truly crucial issues — otherwise, essential\\nquestions will be dealt with in other forums. Secondly,\\nwe need more efficient working methods.\\nThe Economic and Social Council has to finally\\nbecome the central organ in the United Nations system\\nfor consultation and decision-making on economic and\\nsocial issues. We believe that the Council has at two\\nlevels vast potential that has yet to be fully tapped. On\\nthe one hand, that body maintains a network of\\nexpertise unequalled in the world. We have to make\\nbetter and more targeted use of it. On the other hand,\\nwe see the Economic and Social Council as a partner\\nfor the Security Council for peacekeeping, as laid\\ndown in Article 65 of the Charter. When it comes to\\nfighting the causes of conflicts and to post-crisis\\nrehabilitation, the Economic and Social Council has an\\nimportant role to play that can support Security\\nCouncil efforts for conflict prevention and peace-\\nbuilding. We should grant the Economic and Social\\nCouncil more competences in the operative sphere.\\nAfter all, the efforts we make in peace missions\\nwill be successful only if the military commitment is\\nfollowed by a longer phase of stabilization, and very\\noften that phase turns out to be the most difficult one.\\nThe Economic and Social Council advisory groups on\\npost-crisis rehabilitation in Africa are a step in the\\nright direction. That is what the decisive link between\\nconflict management and development cooperation\\ncould indeed look like.\\nSuch an all-embracing approach needs\\nappropriate financial resources. The instrument of\\nvoluntary contributions has proven insufficient in\\neveryday life, and therefore I propose earmarking a\\ncertain share of the United Nations peacekeeping budget\\nfor post-crisis rehabilitation. This means we could\\nachieve what we have long been trying, a “prevention\\nshare”, which — let us remember Haiti — could help\\nus save the costs of conflicts flaring up again.\\nMany criticize the proliferation of subsidiary and\\nsubordinate organizations of the United Nations. Of\\ncourse, a reduction cannot be an end in itself. But we\\nought to exercise enough self-criticism to ask ourselves\\nwhether it would not be better to pool competences in\\nsome cases.\\nHowever, there are also spheres that need to be\\nbetter equipped. I am thinking here, for example, of the\\nhandling of environmental issues in the United Nations\\nsystem. We thus support the proposal made by French\\nPresident Jacques Chirac last year to upgrade the\\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to a\\nspecialized agency with universal membership. That\\n18\\n\\ncould considerably strengthen UNFP’s contribution to\\nsustainable development.\\nAt the heart of the reform of the United Nations\\nis the organ shouldering the central responsibility for\\ninternational peace: the Security Council. Conflicts are\\non the increase. They stretch across all continents, and\\nthey are growing in complexity. In turn, the\\nresponsibility and competences of the Council have\\nexpanded constantly. Crisis prevention will play an\\nincreasingly important role. And for peace-building,\\never more comprehensive strategies, closer cooperation\\nand additional resources will be needed. This will\\nmean more and more decisions that entail long-term\\nobligations, create new international law and make\\nmajor inroads into State sovereignty.\\nIf we really want Security Council decisions to be\\naccepted as legitimate and implemented effectively, we\\nhave to reform the Council. It has to more broadly\\nrepresent a world organization that today embraces\\nmore than 191 countries. That is inconceivable without\\nincreasing the number of seats — for permanent and\\nnon-permanent members alike. The reasons behind\\nsuch a move speak for themselves.\\nA Council with more members would enjoy\\ngreater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater\\nauthority. The more balanced and comprehensive\\nrepresentation of all continents — also among the\\npermanent members — would lead to a better sense of\\nownership of the Security Council for all States.\\nSimilarly, an enlargement would considerably bolster\\nthe motivation of the new Council members to make a\\nlong-term contribution to realizing the goals of the\\nUnited Nations.\\nThe enlargement must adequately reflect sea\\nchanges such as decolonization, the end of the cold war\\nand globalization. The composition of the Council\\nmust ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality.\\nThat means that all major regions of the South must be\\nrepresented by permanent members in the Security\\nCouncil. At the same time, account has to be taken of\\nMembers that can and want to make a particularly\\nmeaningful and sustainable contribution to maintaining\\nworld peace and international security and to realizing\\nthe purposes of the Organization. That twofold\\napproach would increase the Council’s efficiency and\\nits ability to act and to assert itself.\\nFor 40 years, the composition of the Security\\nCouncil has remained unchanged. I believe it is high\\ntime to adapt it to the new global reality. Half-baked or\\ninterim solutions are neither necessary nor helpful.\\nLike Brazil, India and Japan, Germany too is ready to\\ntake on the responsibility associated with a permanent\\nseat in the security Council. But it is especially\\nimportant to us that the African continent be\\nrepresented among the new permanent members.\\nA second aspect also has to be taken into account\\nin Security Council reform. All in all, a greater number\\nof Member States that are engaging themselves in the\\nwork of the United Nations should be able to get more\\ninvolved in the work of the Security Council. For that\\nto happen, additional non-permanent seats also have to\\nbe created. That would mean that the balance between\\npermanent and non-permanent members could be\\nretained.\\nAs I said before, United Nations reform will be\\nthe central and defining theme of this General\\nAssembly session. I thus call upon Member States: let\\nus use the fifty-ninth session, right up until the next\\nsession in 2005, to launch the overdue reforms and\\nachieve tangible results. We, the Member States, have\\nto muster the political insight, the will and the\\ncreativity to adapt the Organization to the global\\nreality. Germany is ready to make a committed\\ncontribution.', 'Two years\\nago I had the great satisfaction of personally\\nwitnessing, in this very Hall, Switzerland’s entry into\\nthe United Nations. I will never forget the whole-\\nhearted welcome that Switzerland received on that\\noccasion.\\nSwitzerland’s accession to the United Nations\\ntook place at a time when the fight against terrorism\\ndominated international debate and divergences in\\nopinion on how to proceed with respect to Iraq were\\nwidening. Dissension arose once again within the\\nSecurity Council. That experience showed that any\\naction taken in the absence of a mandate that is clearly\\ndefined in a Security Council resolution is doomed to\\nfailure. Such actions can only result in differences of\\nopinion that reduce the effectiveness of the\\ninternational community’s efforts and jeopardize\\ninternational security.\\nWhen all is said and done, however, the Iraq\\ncrisis has made clear that the international community\\nremains committed to a multilateral system for\\nmaintaining international peace and security, but that\\nthe structures currently in place are no longer\\nappropriate.\\nThere is now, therefore, a clear need for reform\\nand for strengthening the means of joint action. The\\nHigh-Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General\\nto make recommendations for ensuring effective joint\\naction is a first step on the road to reform. Switzerland\\nactively supports that initiative.\\nThus, this past spring, we invited a group of\\nexperts to discuss the subject of the right of self-\\ndefence, and in that context, the role of the Security\\nCouncil. Their conclusion was that it is neither\\nnecessary nor desirable to extend or reinterpret the\\nright of individual self-defence set out in the Charter.\\nWhat we must do is strengthen joint action; that is the\\nissue on which we must focus.\\nIn this context, prevention is essential. On the one\\nhand, we must ensure improved living conditions\\nthroughout the world; on the other, multilateral\\ninstitutions must respond more rapidly to nascent\\ncrises.\\n17\\n\\nA more rapid response does not necessarily mean\\nmilitary intervention. Switzerland has always held the\\nview that force must remain an instrument of last\\nresort. Apart from situations of self-defence, force may\\nbe used only with the approval of the Security Council\\nand when other methods of persuasion or pressure have\\nbeen exhausted.\\nA more rapid response also means that the\\nSecurity Council must fully exercise its primary\\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\\nsecurity, which is conferred upon it by the Charter.\\nThis raises the issue of the legitimacy of action of the\\nSecurity Council and, in particular, the question of its\\ncomposition. After more than 10 years of deliberation\\non that issue, it is time we found a solution. The\\ncomposition of the Security Council must better reflect\\nthe changes that have taken place in the international\\ncontext since its creation, and developing countries\\nmust have a greater role to play. Greater account must\\nbe taken of the financial and material contributions of\\nspecific Member States.\\nOn the other hand, Switzerland is opposed to the\\ncreation of new seats with the right of veto, because\\nthe right of veto in its current form is undemocratic and\\nhampers the capacity of the Security Council to act. In\\nthe interests of greater legitimacy, those countries that\\nare not members of the Security Council should have\\nmore opportunity to participate in the decision-making\\nprocess. In particular, it is important to strengthen\\nmechanisms for consultation with countries directly\\ninvolved in situations of tension.\\nReforming institutions may be an arduous and\\nunrewarding task, but it is indispensable for increasing\\nthe efficiency of the United Nations and for promoting\\npeace. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for\\nthe work that he has already done and encourage him\\nto continue along the same path.\\nOver and above institutional aspects, the\\ncommitment of Member States is critical if the United\\nNations is to be effective. First of all, if it is to remain\\ncredible, the United Nations and its Member States\\nmust be the unassailable guarantors of international\\nlaw and, in particular, international humanitarian law. I\\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\\nAnnan, for having emphasized today the absolute\\nprimacy of the rule of law — a source a strength for\\nthe weak. Switzerland will continue to insist that\\nrespect for the rule of law is the only practical way\\nforward. In the absence of a political solution to the\\nconflict in Darfur, for example, civilians have become\\nthe victims of attacks that constitute a serious violation\\nof international humanitarian law — a violation which\\nmust be punished by the appropriate national and, if\\nnecessary, international, bodies.\\nFor that reason, too, following the adoption of\\nresolution ES-10/15 on the advisory opinion of the\\nInternational Court of Justice — which found that the\\nconstruction of the separation barrier in the occupied\\nPalestinian territory by Israel is contrary to\\ninternational law — Switzerland accepts, in its\\ncapacity as depositary of the Geneva Conventions, the\\nmandate to conduct consultations on ways and means\\nfor the parties concerned to achieve greater respect for\\ninternational humanitarian law.\\nIf it is to be strong, the United Nations must be\\nable to rely on those States with the necessary\\nresources to help it carry out its tasks. All of those\\ncountries, including my own, are called upon to\\nprovide the personnel and materials needed by\\npeacekeeping missions. The appalling attack on the\\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad underscores\\nthe need to give special consideration to the security of\\nthe United Nations and its staff. Fortunately, additional\\nsecurity measures are now in place. Other measures\\nmust follow. It is our shared duty to ensure that the\\nSecretary-General has the necessary financial resources\\nat his disposal.\\nAs I said earlier, prevention will depend on the\\nfight against poverty. In autumn next year, we plan to\\ngather together to undertake the first assessment of the\\nstate of progress on the Millennium Development\\nGoals. We must already admit that our efforts have\\nbeen inadequate. Of course, every country has its\\nbudgetary constraints. But we also have a duty to keep\\nthe promises we made at the dawn of the millennium.\\nPresident Lula da Silva made this point earlier,\\nforcefully and with commitment. He recalled our\\nresponsibility to history — which we endorse — to\\neliminate poverty while we have the means to do so.\\nIn that context, I welcome the fact that trade\\nliberalization within the framework of the Doha Round\\nregained some momentum this summer in Geneva.\\nDifficult negotiations still lie ahead of us —\\nnegotiations that must seek to meet expectations that\\nare sometimes contradictory. Switzerland intends to\\nplay a constructive role, and I call on all our partners to\\n18\\n\\ncommit themselves to ensure the early success of the\\ndevelopment round.\\nPrevention will require us to both detect and\\ndefuse today the problems of tomorrow. I believe that\\nour efforts to promote peace must be rapidly fleshed\\nout in two areas. The first of these is conflict that is\\nborne of religion. Killing is unacceptable, and it is\\nespecially so if it is carried out for religious reasons.\\nYet increasingly frequently, religion is becoming the\\nonly frame of reference for analysing political and\\nsocial problems. Such an extreme simplification of\\nreality runs the risk of heightening tension. The\\ninternational community must find a solution, and the\\nUnited Nations is the ideal forum in which to do so.\\nThe second area is environmental preservation.\\nThe increasing scarcity of resources is sowing the\\nseeds of conflict over appropriation and distribution.\\nSustainable development must not be allowed to\\nbecome an empty concept. Our actions to date within\\nthe context of the United Nations have not been\\nsufficient to enable us to fulfil our responsibilities\\ntowards future generations. Devoting more time to\\nseeking agreement on the Kyoto Protocol than the\\nfounding fathers took to draft the Charter of the United\\nNations is beneath our dignity.\\nThe United Nations will be judged by its success\\nin meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\\nThe institutional reforms now under way are a step in\\nthe right direction. It is up to us, the Member States,\\nresolutely to commit ourselves to promote peace and to\\nmake the United Nations the instrument for carrying\\nout that essential task.', 'We Austrians unfailingly\\nkeep the United Nations in high esteem. Let me try to\\nexplain why.\\nAustria became a Member of the United Nations\\nin December 1955. That was only half a year after our\\nfull sovereignty had been restored through a treaty\\nconcluded with the United States, the Soviet Union, the\\nUnited Kingdom and France, called the Austrian State\\nTreaty.\\nFifty years ago, becoming part of the family of\\nnations was a powerful motive for us. We could build\\non your trust. We could rely on your help. We later\\nsolved complex problems such as the question of\\nSüdtirol with you, our partners in the United Nations.\\nAnd we have since been eager to return to others in\\nneed the help extended to us.\\nMore than anything else, it is our own experience\\nthat nurtures our confidence in the potential of the\\nUnited Nations as a promoter of peace and a beacon of\\nhope for so many who face the dire challenges and\\nthreats to our societies — be they armed conflict or\\nhunger, terrorism or environmental disaster. We need\\nthe United Nations to be relevant, responsive and\\nreliable — today and in the years to come.\\nThe reform process initiated by Secretary-\\nGeneral Kofi Annan and reflected in the World Summit\\nOutcome document will further enhance that potential.\\nWe may not have achieved all we were striving for, but\\nlet us not disregard the progress made, for it will — if\\nacted upon — make a difference to people in need of\\nour support, in need of our protection.\\nPromoting peace is the United Nations very\\nraison d’être. Since Austria joined the United Nations,\\nsome 54,000 Austrian peacekeepers have participated\\nin more than 50 missions all over the world. Currently,\\n1,200 of them are deployed in missions from Kosovo\\nto the Golan Heights and from Afghanistan to Aceh\\nand the Sudan.\\nIt is also in the light of their practical experience\\nthat we welcome the new peacebuilding commission. It\\nwill provide specific support to people having to cope\\nwith the manifold challenges along the path from war\\nto real peace. I wish to say one word on women in that\\ncontext. Creating confidence in post-conflict societies\\nrequires the active participation and deliberate\\ninvolvement of women. They must become key\\npartners in our peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts.\\n2\\n\\nThe European Union, as the major donor to post-conflict\\nreconstruction and development, will substantially\\ncontribute to the peacebuilding commission’s work. It\\nshould therefore have a place in the commission.\\nFor us and many people all over the world, the\\nmost serious failure of the present reform effort was\\nthe lack of agreement on effective and verifiable\\nmeasures against nuclear proliferation and for\\ndisarmament. We must strengthen the multilateral\\nverification mechanisms and enable the International\\nAtomic Energy Agency to make best use of its\\ncapacity. We must not abandon our efforts to find\\ncommon ground on those most challenging tasks.\\nIn this vulnerable world, we need to foster trust\\nbetween communities and peoples and help to identify\\nshared values. Austria thus strongly supports every\\nform of dialogue among civilizations, religions and\\ncultures. In particular, we need to reach out to the\\nIslamic world, both internationally and inside our\\nsocieties. As a concrete contribution, Austria will host\\nan international conference in November on Islam in a\\npluralistic world.\\nAnywhere in the world, individuals will be able\\nto live and unfold in larger freedom only when their\\nfundamental needs of development, security and\\nhuman rights are met. We need to address those\\nrequirements in a comprehensive and integrated manner.\\nWe are grateful to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\\nso remarkably raised awareness on that matter.\\nThe Millennium Development Goals contain\\nspecific promises of solidarity. Austria therefore\\nwelcomes our continued common commitments, in\\nparticular to poverty eradication and the global\\npartnership for sustainable development. In\\ncontributing to the funding effort, we will raise our\\nofficial development assistance to 0.51 per cent of our\\ngross national income by 2010.\\nPromoting human security is an ever more\\ndemanding task. Our decisions on the “responsibility to\\nprotect” are a courageous step forward in international\\nrelations, but more importantly, they are an offer of\\nhope to those most vulnerable to genocide, war crimes,\\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We must\\nnot let them down. In the words of Simon Wiesenthal,\\nwho sadly passed away last night in Vienna, what\\nconnects 2,000 years of genocide is “too much power\\nin too few hands”. Ten years ago, at this Assembly,\\nSimon Wiesenthal proposed to organize a worldwide\\nconference aimed at reducing hate. He said that\\n“technology without hatred can be so beneficial for\\nmankind, but in conjunction with hatred it leads to\\ndisaster” (A/50/PV.66, p. 9). Reality has since\\nillustrated the profound relevance of that proposal.\\nIn our globalized world, the concept of\\nneighbourhood has taken on a new meaning. In the eye\\nof disaster, we are all neighbours, no matter how far or\\nclose. As the tsunami and recent hurricanes have taught\\nus, there is an emerging sense of shared destiny and\\nresponsibility no longer limited to geographical\\nvicinity. Let me on this occasion express our gratitude\\nto all those private donors who set a mark of living\\nsolidarity.\\nAustria’s clear commitment to effective\\nmultilateralism is at the very heart of our work in the\\nEuropean Union and the United Nations. It is in that\\nspirit that we are a candidate for Security Council\\nmembership in 2009-2010.\\nPromoting the rule of law is the key to an\\nenvironment of trust within our societies. It enables\\nindividuals to enjoy a self-determined life. For many,\\nthe rule of law is synonymous with normality and\\npredictability in their private and professional lives.\\nWe therefore welcome the proposed establishment of a\\nrule of law assistance unit in the Secretariat to advise\\nStates in their efforts towards the rule of law.\\nOne of the main achievements of the summit was\\nthe decision to establish a human rights council, even if\\nthe concrete set-up remains to be defined. In our view,\\nwe need a standing body with the ability to address\\nurgent human rights issues swiftly and efficiently. That\\nis no mere management question. What is at stake is\\nthe new Council’s capacity to make a difference for\\nthose in need. It is now crucial that negotiations start\\nwithout delay in order to seize the momentum of the\\nreform.\\nHuman rights are also a matter of education. In\\nthe framework of the Human Security Network,\\nAustria has therefore developed a human rights manual\\nthat has been translated into all United Nations\\nlanguages. It is used in training programmes in Austria\\nand abroad and we encourage our partners to make use\\nof that instrument.\\nStrengthening human rights and the rule of law\\nwill increase security. That is true for societies at large,\\nbut it is also true for the smallest communities and\\n3\\n\\nindividual households. Full respect for the rights of\\nwomen and children is therefore indispensable in the\\nworld of increased justice and equality we strive for.\\nToo many women are victims of violence. We therefore\\nwelcome the study currently being prepared by the\\nSecretary-General on all forms of violence against\\nwomen.\\nMuch remains to be done. The Doha Development\\nRound has to promote improved market access. In our\\nefforts to protect the environment, we have to enhance\\nthe use of renewable energy and reduce the emission of\\ngreenhouse gases. We also need to finalize the\\ncomprehensive anti-terrorism convention, as agreed at the\\nworld summit, and adopt and implement the counter-\\nterrorism strategy proposed by the Secretary-General.\\nReal freedom is within reach if we, through the\\nUnited Nations, join our forces to promote peace,\\nsecurity and justice — not only freedom from want and\\nfreedom from fear, but eventually freedom to live in\\ndignity for both women and men across the globe.', 'Speaking for the first time from this rostrum, I wish to\\nreaffirm here the importance France attaches to the\\nmultilateral system. Our common future cannot be\\nenvisaged without strengthening it.\\nThe declaration adopted the day before yesterday\\nis a milestone in that direction, even if it does not meet\\nall our expectations. Indeed, the text makes some\\nsignificant advances. I am thinking in particular of\\ninnovative financing for development. I am also\\nthinking of the decision to establish a peacebuilding\\ncommission within the Security Council. Finally, I am\\nthinking of the establishment of a Human Rights\\nCouncil and the endorsement of the principle of the\\nresponsibility to protect. Now it is up to us to put those\\nnew concepts into practice.\\nIn that connection, I wish to pay tribute here to\\nthe remarkable work that has been done under the\\nstewardship of Mr. Jean Ping.\\nBut let us not underestimate the extent of the task\\nthat still remains to be accomplished, be it in the areas\\nof counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, Security\\nCouncil reform or development assistance.\\nThe United Nations is founded on the rule of law\\nand the promotion of universal standards. Those reflect\\nour common values and our conviction that there can\\nbe no security and development without scrupulous\\nrespect for human rights. This is not a moral question\\nbut one of respect for the identity of every individual.\\nIt is not a matter of passing judgement but of enabling\\nall people to live in greater freedom and in dignity.\\nLet us reject the impressment of children in\\narmed conflicts, the systematic use of sexual violence\\nagainst women and girls as a weapon of war, the\\nrecourse to threats, arbitrary detention and torture of\\nopponents, journalists, labour leaders and defenders of\\nhuman rights. And, let us conclude the negotiations on\\na convention against forced disappearances. To that\\nend, let us strengthen the Office of the United Nations\\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and promptly\\nestablish the Human Rights Council.\\nFrance particularly welcomes the fact that the\\ninternational community now has the necessary\\nlegitimacy to exercise effectively its responsibility to\\nprotect populations threatened by ethnic cleansing,\\ncrimes against humanity and genocide. France also\\nwelcomes the progress of the international criminal\\njustice system, in particular through the action of the\\nSecurity Council. Those who believe they can count on\\nthe international community not to act when they\\ncommit their crimes should make no mistake: they will\\nbe held accountable.\\nSixty years after the founding of the United\\nNations, terrorism is now at the top of the list of human\\nrights violations. Nothing — no cause, religion or\\nmoral order — can justify attacks on the lives of\\ninnocents, the lives of civilians. We must define acts of\\nterrorism once and for all so that we can better combat\\nthat barbaric practice which sets humankind back.\\n17\\n\\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nconstitutes another major threat for the planet, against\\nwhich we must remain united and determined.\\nFrance, together with its British and German\\npartners, has proposed to Iran a constructive approach\\npaving the way for a new relationship between that\\ngreat country and the international community. That\\nrelationship is currently compromised by concerns over\\nIran’s nuclear programme. We ask Iran to build trust by\\nproviding objective guarantees on the exclusively\\npeaceful nature of its programme. Iran’s statements\\nfrom this rostrum compel the international community\\nto meet its responsibilities, as referral of the matter to\\nthe Security Council is on the agenda in order to\\nstrengthen the authority of the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency. The very integrity of the non-\\nproliferation regime is at stake.\\nBut let us also work to reduce the proliferation of\\nsmall arms and light weapons, which fuel so many very\\ndeadly conflicts.\\nTo better serve peace and ensure the security of\\npopulations, the Security Council has expanded its\\nfield of action to the trafficking that finances conflicts\\nand the impunity that protects traffickers, using, in\\nparticular, sanctions and embargoes. The United\\nNations is resolutely engaged on the ground, at the\\nvery heart of conflicts. More than 70,000 blue\\nhelmeted soldiers and police officers are now serving\\nin 18 peacekeeping operations, and thousands of others\\nare operating under Security Council mandates.\\nThe results can be seen, for example, in Timor-\\nLeste, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi,\\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. But as countries emerge from\\ncrisis, it is essential that they continue to benefit from\\nour full attention and support. The United Nations has\\nthe duty to take a central role in the transition phase\\nthrough the Peacebuilding Commission.\\nOther situations demand great vigilance and a\\nhigh level of mobilization. Thus, in Haiti, the presence\\nof strong contingents of United Nations soldiers and\\npolice must lead to the strengthening of the political\\nprocess by involving all peaceful forces without\\nexception. Preparations for elections must be\\naccelerated. Like all peoples, the Haitian people, who\\nhave suffered for too long, are entitled to respect and\\nfreedom.\\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, the presence of the United\\nNations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire and the\\nappointment of a High Representative of the Secretary-\\nGeneral for the elections should also help strengthen\\nimplementation of the process set out at Marcoussis\\nand Pretoria.\\nBut in Côte d’Ivoire, as in Haiti, the determined\\naction of the united international community will not\\nproduce results unless all parties cooperate in good\\nfaith and demonstrate their sense of responsibility. In\\nAbidjan as in Bouaké, all must respect their pledged\\ncommitments so that free and transparent elections can\\nbe held throughout the country. No other solution is\\npossible. That is why it is essential to resolutely\\nsupport the electoral process that has begun, as well as\\nthe demobilization, disarmament and reintegration\\nprogrammes. All Ivorian parties must understand that\\nthey will not block the peace efforts with impunity if\\nthey take an obstructive stance, make hate speeches or\\nchallenge democratic rules. The Security Council will\\nmeet its responsibilities.\\nThe situation in Lebanon demonstrates what can\\nbe accomplished by a determined international\\nmobilization, supported by the courageous will of the\\npeople. Most Syrian forces have now left Lebanon.\\nElections have been held. A representative Government\\nhas been formed. Our Organization must continue to\\nsupport the Lebanese Government’s efforts to recover\\nfull sovereignty and exercise its authority over the\\nwhole of its territory. At the same time, we must\\ncontinue to support the work of the commission of\\ninquiry into the assassination of Rafik Hariri. We are\\ndetermined to see justice done.\\nAlso with respect to the Middle East, a dynamic\\nof hope, which could touch all States of the region, is\\nemerging following Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza.\\nFrance, together with its European partners, stands\\nwith the Palestinians to rebuild and develop that\\nterritory so that its inhabitants can move around freely\\nand have access to jobs and, quite simply, to decent\\nliving conditions.\\nBut we must not stop there. It is important to\\nrestore political prospects for relaunching\\nimplementation of the road map by, on the one hand,\\nencouraging the Palestinians to redouble their efforts\\non security and, on the other, encouraging the Israelis\\nto take the measures necessary to stop settlement\\nactivity and to comply with international law in their\\n18\\n\\nstruggle for security. Peace can come only with the\\nexistence of two peaceful and democratic States living\\nside by side in peace and security.\\nFinally, with respect to Iraq, France remains\\nengaged so that, with the assistance of the United\\nNations in particular, the Iraqi people can acquire\\ndemocratic institutions with which all Iraqis can feel\\nidentified. It is clear that a policy focused exclusively\\non security leads to the retrenchment of a community,\\nthus jeopardizing the cohesion of Iraqi society and the\\ncountry’s unity. In Iraq, too, the political process must\\nnot exclude any representative, peaceful force, and the\\npolitical process must offer Iraq the prospect of the\\nrestoration of its complete sovereignty.\\nIn all those crises, the Security Council has\\ngradually imposed the authority of the United Nations\\nin the service of international peace and security. Its\\naction is legitimate, and its authority will be further\\nstrengthened when we reach agreement on an\\nenlargement of the Council that reflects the emergence\\nof new Powers and which gives an equitable place to\\nall continents.\\nAt the same time, it is important to carry out the\\nthorough management reforms that our Organization\\nrequires. In his report entitled “In larger freedom”\\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General proposed elements\\nof an action plan and initiated the first reforms. I pay\\ntribute to his resoluteness and reaffirm France’s\\ndetermination to support him in his approach.\\nWe all know that security and development\\ncannot be separated. Five years after the Millennium\\nSummit, heads of State or Government have just issued\\na troubling assessment of the implementation of the\\nMillennium Development Goals.\\nThe outcome document they adopted (resolution\\n60/1) clearly sets out the priorities on which we must\\ntake action. The first of those sadly remains food\\nsecurity, because, as underlined by the Declaration on\\nAction Against Hunger and Poverty, adopted in 2004\\non the initiative of President Lula and President\\nChirac, hunger remains the worst weapon of mass\\ndestruction. It continues to kill several hundred million\\nmen, women and children around the planet. We can\\nsee it happening right now in the Sahel and southern\\nAfrica. That scourge belonging to another age can and\\nmust be fought.\\nOf course, emergency humanitarian aid must be\\nprovided to people in distress. That implies\\nstrengthening the coordination of United Nations\\ninterventions and, in particular, the establishment of an\\ninternational humanitarian force, as proposed on\\nseveral occasions by France.\\nBut beyond that, it is important to provide all\\nareas at risk with the technical resources for prevention\\nand early warning. Above all, it is essential to create\\nthe conditions for sustainable development to the\\nbenefit of all. That is the aim of the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals, whose attainment requires\\nsubstantial long-term financing. Official development\\nassistance will continue to be primary for much time to\\ncome. The summit’s outcome document recalls the\\ninternational commitments made in that regard, which\\nFrance and the European Union will respect. It is\\nurgent that the other developed countries make the\\nsame commitments. But we know well that this will\\nnot be sufficient. Additional long-term resources have\\nto be found through innovative financing mechanisms.\\nFrance endorses the establishment of\\ninternational solidarity contributions. Over 66\\ncountries have given their support to the pilot project\\nto levy a tax on airline tickets, and we welcome this. In\\nFebruary, France will host a ministerial conference on\\nthis initiative so that it can be implemented specifically\\nand promptly.\\nBy devoting three of the eight Goals to health, the\\nMillennium Declaration has put public health back at\\nthe centre of sustainable development. In terms of its\\nscope and socio-economic impact, the HIV/AIDS\\npandemic is of concern to us all. Only by working\\ntogether will we be able to deal with it, through an\\napproach that integrates prevention, treatment, care and\\nthe medical and social vulnerability of infected\\npersons. France wants to carry out this integrated\\napproach with its European partners and with the\\nWorld Health Organization, the Joint United Nations\\nProgram on HIV/AIDS and the Global Fund to Fight\\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We must do\\neverything possible to achieve universal access to\\ntreatment by 2010, if need be promoting greater\\nflexibility of intellectual property rights as provided for\\nin the Doha international trade agreements.\\nThe fight against AIDS requires us all to mobilize\\nour efforts. For its part, France has pledged to double\\nits contribution to the Global Fund, increasing the\\n19\\n\\namount to 300 million euros by 2007. At the same\\ntime, international cooperation must take into account\\nthe particular challenges faced by certain categories of\\nindividuals: victims of abject poverty who are\\nexcluded, young women denied the right to sexual and\\nreproductive health, those with disabilities\\nmarginalized by society.\\nFrom the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico,\\nfrom Japan to Antarctica, man is confronted today with\\nan unprecedented rise in environmental threats that he\\nhimself has caused. Scientific proof of the reality of\\nclimate change and its human origins are irrefutable.\\nAll initiatives must be compatible with the Kyoto\\nProtocol; prospects must be charted for the future of\\nthe multilateral climate regime after 2012. France\\nwould hope to see more robust commitments,\\nespecially regarding the transfer of technologies to\\nemerging countries. To respond to the threat and more\\neffectively mobilize energies and resources, France and\\nEurope have proposed the establishment of a\\nspecialized agency, based on the United Nations\\nEnvironment Programme, for the purpose of\\ncoordinating international action. This idea is\\nmentioned in the summit’s outcome document; it must\\nnow be translated into reality.\\nThe United Nations is commemorating its sixtieth\\nanniversary this year. The world has changed\\nprofoundly since 1945. Millions of men and women\\nhave gained freedom and have emerged from\\nunderdevelopment. Technological progress has been\\nstaggering and has radically changed the life of society\\nand relations among States. Challenges and threats\\nhave changed; they are now worldwide and jeopardize\\nhumanity itself.\\nYet, we must remain optimistic. It is not too late,\\ngiven that we understand what is at stake and that we\\nmobilize collectively. The United Nations is\\nrediscovering the way charted for it by the founding\\nfathers: helping in the peaceful settlement of disputes,\\nbuilding international cooperation for development and\\npromoting human rights.\\nWe need the United Nations more than ever; it is\\nthe sole framework for universal comprehensive action\\nwhich is legitimate and recognized as such by all\\nStates. Let us give it our full support. France for its\\npart makes this commitment.', 'Allow me to congratulate you most warmly, Sir, on\\nyour election as President of the General Assembly.\\nThrough you, I would like also to thank your\\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for the manner in which he\\nconducted the preparatory work for the summit of\\nHeads of State and Government which has just taken\\nplace. We are very grateful to him for having\\nsuccessfully met that challenge.\\nEven though we had hoped for a more ambitious\\nagreement, the summit allowed us to create a much-\\nneeded new impetus and new strategic guidelines for\\nour Organization. Only a stronger and more legitimate\\nUnited Nations will be able to respond to the\\nchallenges of the twenty-first century and implement\\nthe collective security consensus that we endorsed in\\nthe summit\\'s outcome document.\\nBelgium is a strong advocate of efficient\\nmultilateralism. I emphasize the word \"efficient\"\\nbecause this is not just a declaration of faith. We need\\ncredible structures and strong institutions capable of\\neffectively implementing our international\\ncommitments and addressing our common concerns. It\\nis all too easy to indulge in rhetoric; we have to\\ntranslate our words into action. That is why, in that\\ncontext, I am pleased with the progress made during\\nthe summit.\\nI am particularly pleased with the consensus\\nreached whereby security, peace, development and\\nhuman rights are not only interlinked but mutually\\nreinforcing. That is a significant step forward in our\\nefforts to build a more peaceful, more prosperous and\\nmore equitable world. That idea will guide our actions\\nand form the basis of our approach. Without peace,\\nthere can be no development, and human rights can\\noften be sorely tested. In the absence of development\\nand respect for human rights, stability and security\\nbecome elusive.\\nThe link between development, stability and\\nhuman rights becomes most acutely apparent in fragile\\nor failing States. These are often States devastated by\\nconflict or by civil war - States whose leaders are no\\nlonger capable of meeting the basic needs of their\\npeople. Often, their economic situation has deteriorated\\ndramatically, and sometimes their society itself is in\\ndisarray. A large number of the people of such States\\nmay be displaced. They may have fled, may be subject\\nto abuse or exploitation and therefore cannot enjoy any\\nof the guarantees that a State should be able to provide\\nto its citizens.\\nSome States are at risk of becoming zones of\\nlawlessness, in which terrorist and criminal activities\\ncan thrive. The uncontrolled exploitation of natural\\nresources can fuel all sorts of criminal networks or\\nconflicts - often with an ethnic dimension - in which\\nlarge numbers of weapons can circulate uncontrolled.\\nSuch States must return to peace, stability and the\\nrule of law. They must take control of their own future\\nand gradually begin to consider their prospects for\\ndevelopment. This is not an easy task. The challenge is\\ntremendous. Almost simultaneously, it is necessary to\\nrebuild State institutions; disarm combatants, give\\nthem new prospects and reintegrate them into\\ncommunities that are often impoverished; reorganize\\nthe army and security forces; and give the State the\\nmeans to restore its authority, organize elections and\\ncreate conditions conducive to development.\\nWe must help them break that vicious circle and\\nregain their place in the community of nations. In that\\nrespect, the establishment of a Peacebuilding\\nCommission is crucial. The creation of such a\\nCommission not only illustrates our common resolve to\\nhelp such States on their path to recovery; it allows us,\\nfirst and foremost, better to coordinate and focus our\\nefforts. Political, humanitarian, military and financial\\nresources must be mobilized and used effectively to\\nachieve our common goals.\\nThat is particularly true in the case of sub-\\nSaharan African countries that are ravaged by deadly\\nand prolonged conflicts, with the primary victims\\nbeing the civilian population.\\nThe establishment of such a Commission would\\ngenerate great hope. It is our common responsibility to\\nmake it a success. Belgium wants to contribute\\nactively, including by sharing the experience it\\nacquired in the transition processes in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi.\\nBelgium also attaches great importance to\\npromoting the protection of human rights. My country\\nwelcomes the strengthening of the Office of the High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the decision to\\nestablish a Human Rights Council. But we regret that\\nthe summit was not able to finalize the Councilís\\nmodalities.\\n11\\n\\nBelgium has fully supported the reform and will\\ncontinue to focus on it. Democracy and respect for\\nhuman rights are some of our common values and\\nunderpin our efforts to promote peace and stability.\\nFrom now on, those values will be part of our\\ncollective security consensus and must be incorporated\\ninto our global approach throughout the entire United\\nNations system. They are our common responsibility.\\nAmong the summit\\'s other achievements, I\\nshould like also to highlight the \"responsibility to\\nprotect\". This represents a step forward in the quest for\\nsolutions to the most glaring injustices. In the\\naftermath of the genocides that marked our last\\ncentury, we solemnly pledged that such atrocities\\nwould never happen again.\\nLet me now turn to good governance, which is\\nessential if our efforts to create a more stable and\\nprosperous world are to be successful. The summit\\noutcome document repeatedly underlines its\\nimportance, and rightly so.\\nGood governance is not a moralistic concept\\nimposed from the outside. It is not about giving good\\nor bad grades, and even less about good and bad\\nstudents. It is not for others to say what are good\\npolicies and what are bad policies. No ó good\\ngovernance is synonymous with effective governance\\nand goes hand in hand with sovereignty. It is about\\ngovernance that can produce results, make a difference\\nfor citizens and create fertile ground for development.\\nWithout it, the support of the international community\\ncannot produce the desired results. Without it, the aid\\nof the international community will not find the fertile\\nground essential to create the conditions for greater\\nprosperity and stability.\\nWe have pledged to attain the objective of\\nallocating 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to\\nofficial development assistance. We will keep our\\npromise. But we are aware that development is not\\nonly a question of money; first and foremost, it is a\\nquestion of the effective use of resources. The\\nnecessary conditions must be established. What matters\\nis the outcome on the ground. Poverty is not inevitable;\\nall peoples have a future that belongs to them. They\\nmust take charge of it.\\nWe accordingly have stated, in paragraph 11 of\\nthe summit outcome document (resolution 60/1), \"good\\ngovernance and the rule of law ... are essential for\\nsustained economic growth, sustainable development\\nand the eradication of poverty and hunger\". In the same\\noutcome document, we also clearly reaffirmed our\\ncommitment to good governance and the rule of law,\\nand reaffirmed that each country must take\\nresponsibility for its own development. Those are the\\nterms of our global partnership for development, as set\\nout in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey\\nConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\\nImplementation.\\nAll components of the international community\\nhave demonstrated generosity. That is particularly true\\nof the European Union. But the international\\ncommunity can hardly be held responsible for the\\nfailure of States to protect or assist all or part of their\\npopulations. It is difficult to understand why today we\\nmust launch donor appeals to deal with the large-scale\\ndestruction of houses by a Government that\\ndeliberately leaves some 500,000 of its citizens\\nhomeless.\\nThat reasoning with regard to the subject of good\\ngovernance also applies to the similar concepts of\\ndemocracy and the rule of law. Those are extremely\\nimportant objectives, both for the development of our\\nsocieties and for the security of States. But, neither\\ndemocracy nor the rule of law can be artificially\\nimposed from outside. This is not about dictating\\nexogenous models; we must take a bottom-up approach\\nin creating suitable conditions for the emergence of\\nmechanisms that ensure people\\'s equitable\\nparticipation in their own governance, in a spirit of\\ninclusivity. In that regard, our first priorities should be\\nthe modernization of societies and States and the\\nemancipation of women and children and their\\ninclusion in the global dynamic. Past experience shows\\nthat the shortest path to democracy and the rule of law\\nis the modernization of society. The role - indeed, the\\nresponsibility - of the international community is to\\ngalvanize that modernization process.\\nWe have a great responsibility. Before the end of\\nthe year, the Peacebuilding Commission must be\\nestablished. We also have the task of making the\\nHuman Rights Council operational. I sincerely hope\\nthat the spirit that prevailed during the summit will\\nalso guide the work of the sixtieth session of the\\nGeneral Assembly. We must continue to show\\ndetermination, perseverance and vision in carrying out\\nour work. Only through constant commitment will we\\nmake the United Nations the primary instrument for\\ninternational relations.\\n12\\n\\nThat is the important task ahead of us. Our own\\ncredibility is at stake. We must once again make the\\nUnited Nations the instrument par excellence of our\\nstrategy to build a more stable and more prosperous\\nworld for all. Our peoples demand that. Belgium is\\nwilling to rise to that challenge and to shoulder its\\nresponsibilities.', 'Just a few days\\nago, in this same Hall, the follow-up High-level\\nMeeting was held on the Millennium, bringing together\\nan unprecedented number of high political leaders from\\nall over the world. After a process of discussion and\\nnegotiation, both lengthy and thorough, we adopted\\nwhat should serve as our road map for the period to\\ncome. The final document should not only inspire but\\nalso give specific direction to, the actions of the\\ninternational community in the United Nations.\\nWhile not all our expectations or ambitions were\\nrealized in that document and considerable gaps cry\\nout to be filled — I am thinking particularly of the\\ncrucial areas of disarmament and non-proliferation —\\nwe must, nevertheless, welcome the fact that around\\nthe central pillars of the United Nations, namely,\\ndevelopment, peace and human rights, broad agreement\\nhas crystallized and a new international agenda has in\\nfact emerged.\\nIt is particularly appropriate and propitious that\\nthe current regular session of the General Assembly\\nhas opened immediately following on the important\\nHigh-level Meeting. While we may feel that the\\nfoundation was laid during that important event, what\\n14\\n\\nwe have to do now is to complete what has been\\nundertaken, consolidate the sections of walls that have\\nbeen erected and build those parts that have only been\\nsketched out — and here I am thinking particularly of\\nthe Human Rights Council — and provide our project\\nwith a sound roof.\\nRenewal of multilateralism in the context of the\\nspecial conditions at the beginning of this century and\\nthe reform of the United Nations must be conducted\\nwith determination, driven by a real sense of urgency\\nin the light of the significance of the task that awaits us\\nand the crucial matters at stake for billions of men and\\nwomen.\\nKnowing as I do, Sir, your personal commitment,\\nyour dynamism and your numerous qualities, I am\\nconvinced that you will direct the work of the sixtieth\\nregular session of the General Assembly in such a way\\nso as to ensure that we can, all together, carry out the\\nurgent mandate entrusted to us by the High-level\\nMeeting and, more particularly, by our peoples, who\\nhave placed their hopes on a revamped and\\nstrengthened United Nations system. It is in this spirit\\nthat my country is prepared to subscribe with\\nconviction to the accountability pact proposed by our\\nSecretary-General, whom I would, once again, like to\\ncongratulate for what he has been doing at the head of\\nour Organization.\\nI would note with satisfaction your intention, Sir,\\nto present a detailed and operational workplan in order\\nto organize our work as effectively as possible so that\\nwe can complete the tasks awaiting us according to a\\nfixed timetable. We have to provide concrete evidence\\nthat our Assembly will not go back to business as usual\\nonce the spotlights have been switched off.\\nFor all those — and I am one of them — who\\nbelieve that our Assembly, a veritable parliament of the\\nnations of the world, has a paramount role to play in\\nthe emergence of a strong political consensus at the\\nworld level, the quick adoption of specific operational\\ndecisions should deal a sound rebuff to all those\\nCassandras, all those cynics and all those who uphold\\nthe status quo that opposes change.\\nIn his opening statement at the sixtieth regular\\nsession of the General Assembly, our Secretary-\\nGeneral clearly defined the mission that awaits us in\\nthe coming months. Among the subjects that claim our\\nattention, I would focus on the following: human\\nrights, in order to strengthen the impact of this\\nessential dimension in all the activities of the United\\nNations, particularly through the immediate creation of\\na Human Rights Council on the basis of the positive\\ngroundwork laid in the preparatory work of the High-\\nlevel Meeting; the establishment of the Peacebuilding\\nCommission, an innovative body; the reform of the\\nmain bodies of our Organization, including the urgent\\nneed to enlarge the Security Council in both categories\\nof membership in order to make the Council more\\nrepresentative of the realities at the beginning of the\\ntwenty-first century and to make it more transparent\\nand more effective; giving concrete form to the idea of\\n“the responsibility to protect”, whose confirmation in\\nthe final document is one of the main breakthroughs of\\nthe recent High-level Meeting; and finally, the reform\\nof the administrative and financial management of the\\nUnited Nations in order to consolidate the effectiveness\\nand integrity of the Organization.\\nLet me also devote a few minutes to the question\\nof development. Development remains the main\\npolitical and moral issue of our time. It must be noted\\nthat progress towards the Millennium Development\\nGoals has been uneven and some backward movement\\nmust be acknowledged, particularly in sub-Saharan\\nAfrica. The recently published Human Development\\nReport notes that\\n“In the midst of an increasingly prosperous\\nglobal economy, 10.7 million children every year\\ndo not live to see their fifth birthday, and more\\nthan 1 billion people survive in abject poverty on\\nless than $1 per day. The HIV/AIDS pandemic\\nhas inflicted the single greatest reversal in human\\ndevelopment. In 2003, the pandemic claimed 3\\nmillion lives and left another five million people\\ninfected.” (Human Development Report 2005, p. 1)\\nIn view of these alarming facts, setting up and\\ncreating a genuine partnership for development, based\\non the groundwork of the Monterrey Conference and\\non the basis of shared responsibility borne by both the\\ndonor countries and the recipient countries, remains a\\nmatter of priority. The countries of the South must take\\ntheir own development in hand by defining detailed\\nnational strategies that are effective and directed\\ntowards good governance and combating corruption.\\nThe countries of the North must fulfil their\\ncommitments in matters of trade, debt reduction and\\nenhancing the quality of aid and good practices.\\nParticular emphasis should be laid on increasing\\n15\\n\\nfinancial flows for development. In this connection,\\nwhen Luxembourg occupied the presidency of the\\nEuropean Union during the first half of this year, the\\nmember States of the European Union took the historic\\ndecision to commit themselves on a precise timetable\\nto make a considerable increase of their official\\ndevelopment aid (ODA) in order to achieve the target\\nof 0.7 per cent of their gross national products by 2015\\nat the latest. Four of the five countries, including my\\nown, that have achieved or gone beyond 0.7 per\\ncent — a target reconfirmed by the High-level\\nMeeting — are member States of the European Union.\\nThe Government of Luxembourg has confirmed its\\nintention to increase its ODA contribution in the years\\nto come to one per cent of its gross national income.\\nUnfortunately, too often the fruits of development\\nare erased by natural or man-made disasters. In the\\nSudan, in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere, this\\ntruth is demonstrated daily. There can be no\\ndevelopment without security. There can be no security\\nwithout development.\\nThat is why I particularly welcome the agreement\\nreached during the summit on the establishment of a\\nPeacebuilding Commission. That should make it\\npossible for us to contemplate the tremendous\\nproblems of transition confronting the countries\\nemerging from conflict from an overall viewpoint,\\nbringing together the dimensions of crisis management,\\nhumanitarian aid, reconstruction of State structures and\\nlocal and legal structures and providing essential\\npublic goods and services, while at the same time re-\\nlaunching the process of economic and social\\ndevelopment.\\nOn the basis of the mandate given by the summit,\\nLuxembourg actively supports the reform of the\\nCentral Emergency Revolving Fund, which should take\\nshape in coming months so that this renovated Fund\\ncan become fully operational by the beginning of 2006.\\nMy country has already announced, just a few days ago\\nhere in New York, that it would be making a\\ncontribution of $4 million to the capital of this Fund,\\nand other States have also confirmed large\\ncontributions.\\nIf development is, according to the well-known\\nformula, the new name of peace, we cannot fail,\\nnevertheless, to note that numerous international\\nconflicts and intra-State conflicts and hotbeds of\\ntension continue to dot the face of the world.\\nPeace and stability in the Middle East continue to\\nbe at the forefront of our concerns.\\nThe current President of the Council of the\\nEuropean Union, my friend Jack Straw, recalled two\\ndays ago from this rostrum the spirit in which the\\nnegotiations on the nuclear issue were conducted with\\nIran in recent months. Cooperation and respect for\\ninternational norms and treaties, rather than\\ndiscrimination or a desire to create dependency, were\\nwhat motivated us in this case. In the Paris Agreement\\nIran subscribed to a total suspension of all activities\\nconnected with enrichment and all reprocessing\\nactivities. It is that commitment that made it possible\\nto develop political and economic cooperation with the\\nEuropean Union. It is that commitment — which, I\\nhardly need to recall, has been ratified by the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency — that I today\\ncall upon Iran to respect.\\nIn this context, I should also like to welcome the\\nagreement that was reached just today with the\\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to abandon all\\nnuclear programmes and to rejoin the Nuclear Non-\\nProliferation Treaty (NPT). This is excellent news.\\nOn 22 June 2005, more than 80 countries and\\norganizations met in Brussels at the International\\nConference on Iraq, sponsored jointly by the European\\nUnion and the United States, with the presence of our\\nSecretary-General, and expressed their support for the\\nIraqi Transitional Government and its political,\\neconomic and security priorities. That important\\nConference made it possible, in particular, for the\\nStates members of the European Union to reaffirm\\ntheir unanimous and united support for a secure, stable,\\nunified, prosperous, democratic Iraq, respectful of\\nhuman rights, which will benefit fully from the\\nexercise of its sovereignty, cooperate constructively\\nwith its neighbours and with the international\\ncommunity, and end violence in that country. And it is\\nour Organization that, more than ever, must be a\\ndriving force, play a leading role, in that context.\\nThe Near East has only rarely been the scene of\\npositive developments. This is why I should like\\nparticularly and expressly to welcome the political\\ncourage of the leaders of the two sides regarding the\\nsuccessful withdrawal from Gaza and certain parts of\\nthe north of the West Bank. Now we should take\\nadvantage of that positive dynamic to launch a genuine\\npeace prospect based on the road map, which continues\\n16\\n\\nto be the essential framework in this matter. The\\nconditions to promote the emergence of a climate of\\npeace were recalled by the European Council on 16 and\\n17 June 2005. In particular, the fact that the Palestinian\\nAuthority is taking control of Gaza now provides it\\nwith an opportunity to demonstrate its institutional and\\nadministrative maturity, particularly as regards\\nmaintaining law and order and combating terrorism.\\nThe cessation of all acts of violence by the parties is\\nalso an essential requirement.\\nRegarding the crucial question of Israeli\\ncolonization activities in the occupied territories, the\\nEuropean Council noted that “the policy of\\ncolonization is an obstacle to peace and threatens\\nmaking virtually impossible any solution based on the\\ncoexistence of two States”. In the same context, the\\nEuropean Council expressed concern at the\\ncontinuation of the building of the separation barrier in\\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, including East\\nJerusalem and its surrounding areas, which contradicts\\nthe pertinent provisions of international law. At the\\nsame time, of course, the Council recognized the right\\nof Israel to protect its citizens against attacks.\\nLet us assume that the next meeting of the\\nQuartet, which will be held in New York tomorrow,\\nwill find political formulas that will make it possible to\\ncontinue the positive dynamic of disengagement from\\nGaza and will clear the way for a just and lasting peace\\nin this divided part of our world.\\nAs very often happens, patches of clouds and\\nglimmers of hope are mingled when we analyse the\\ninternational situation, but one thing remains constant,\\nand that is the central role of the United Nations in the\\nsearch for international peace and security. Sixty years\\nafter the signing of the San Francisco Charter, we have\\nall met together here to confirm our contract of\\nconfidence with this Organization, the United Nations,\\nwhich is our common heritage — a United Nations\\nrenovated and reformed, synchronized with the threats\\nand challenges of our times and able to respond to the\\nexpectations of the peoples of the world. As a\\nsignatory to the Charter in 1945, Luxembourg, as far as\\nit is concerned, is ready to renew this pledge of\\nconfidence with enthusiasm, confidence and\\ndetermination.', 'Please accept\\nmy congratulations, Sir, on your election to the\\npresidency of this historic sixtieth session of the\\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you every success. I would\\nalso like to express my sincere thanks to the outgoing\\nPresident for his dedicated work at the fifty-ninth\\nsession. I endorse the statement of the European Union\\n(EU) presidency.\\nThe debate at last week’s summit highlighted one\\nimportant point, namely, that peace, development,\\nsecurity and human rights are inseparably linked. One\\ncannot address human rights and security without also\\naddressing development. All of those issues are at the\\nvery heart of our policies.\\nPeople are waiting for our solutions to the\\npressing problems of development. We must achieve\\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Of that we are\\nacutely aware, both in Germany and in Europe. The EU\\nplan to reach the 0.7 per cent official development\\nassistance goal by 2015, and the Group of Eight (G-8)\\ncommitments made at Gleneagles, substantially\\nstrengthen the financial basis of our work.\\nWe are also willing to forge new paths by making\\nuse of innovative financing mechanisms.\\nAt the same time, frameworks establishing fair\\nconditions for international trade are a prerequisite if\\npoorer States are to share the benefits of globalization.\\nThe EU is leading the way with its “Everything But\\nArms” initiative, which grants the least developed\\ncountries duty-free and quota-free market access. In\\nthat context, we must do all we can to make the\\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\\nOrganization, to be held in Hong Kong in December, a\\nsuccess. Only in that way can we bring the Doha round\\nnegotiations to a successful conclusion.\\nWe also know that excessive indebtedness curbs\\ngrowth and development. The realignment of the\\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\\nInitiative after 1999 has considerably reduced the\\nindebtedness of some 27 States. Germany has to date\\nforgiven €6.5 billion of debt and has earmarked a\\nfurther €4 billion for the continuation of the HIPC\\ninitiative.\\nDebt relief is, however, dependent on all creditors\\nspreading the burden fairly among themselves. We are\\nalarmed by the fact that commercial and State creditors\\noutside the Paris Club are doing less and less to live up\\nto their responsibilities. I would like to seize this\\nopportunity to call for your support at the forthcoming\\nannual meeting of the Bretton Woods institutions, for\\nthe G-8 proposal and for an extensive cancellation of\\ndebts — including multilateral debts — for the\\ncountries concerned.\\nAll of the foregoing emphasizes the great\\nimportance we attach to the global partnership for\\n33\\n\\ndevelopment. That partnership is not, however, a one-\\nway street. It also requires a commitment by partner\\nStates to put in place the conditions for\\ndevelopment — that is, democracy, good governance,\\nrespect for human rights and anti-corruption measures.\\nClimate protection and development are also\\nclosely intertwined. Of course, everyone must have\\naccess to energy. Nevertheless, all States must do their\\npart to prevent the ominous advance of climate change.\\nIn late November the parties to the United Nations\\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\\nKyoto Protocol will meet in Montreal. There, we will\\nhave the opportunity to adopt effective mechanisms to\\nreduce emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2012.\\nThat is precisely the policy pursued by the Kyoto\\nProtocol, and it is a policy we will adhere to.\\nThis year two natural catastrophes — the tsunami\\nin the Indian Ocean and Hurricane Katrina in the\\nUnited States of America — have clearly demonstrated\\njust how vulnerable our societies are to natural\\ndisasters. We have all learned just how important\\ndisaster prevention is. As host to the Third\\nInternational Conference on Early Warning, which will\\nbe held in Bonn in March 2006, Germany hopes to\\ncontribute to making better use of and improving early\\nwarning mechanisms and thereby limiting the scale of\\nthe damage caused by such disasters. Here I would like\\nto take this opportunity to reiterate our invitation to all\\nMember States to join us in making the Bonn\\nConference a success.\\nFor years, United Nations engagement has been\\nhailed all over the world as a welcome sign of\\nprotection and assistance, of peace and reconstruction.\\nLast Sunday saw the first free parliamentary elections\\nin Afghanistan under the new Constitution. The\\nGovernment of Afghanistan, with a full complement of\\ndemocratically legitimated institutions, is now\\nprepared to assume responsibility for the further\\nreconstruction of the country. By going to the polls,\\nmillions of women and men in Afghanistan have\\nproved that they have opted for democracy. Our thanks\\ngo to the United Nations, which worked hard to make\\nthose elections possible.\\nIn his latest report on Afghanistan (A/60/224) the\\nSecretary-General announced that the United Nations\\nwill remain committed to assisting the country after the\\nelections. I heartily endorse that commitment; such\\nhelp is indispensable. For even if the Bonn process,\\nlaunched four years ago, has now been brought to a\\nsuccessful conclusion, the international community\\nwill still need to stand by Afghanistan. Germany, too,\\nwill continue to do its utmost to support the country.\\nThe President returned to the Chair.\\nTen years after the conclusion of the Dayton\\nAgreement, and six years after the end of the Kosovo\\nconflict, the situation in the Western Balkans has\\nimproved tangibly. Nonetheless, major progress is still\\nrequired in the political, legal and economic fields. The\\npeople of that region must genuinely come to terms\\nwith their past, and the parties to the conflict must be\\nreconciled. In that connection, we call for full\\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\\nfor the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.\\nThe Middle East still faces great challenges. As\\nits neighbours, we in Europe have a strategic interest in\\npeace and stability in the region. We are convinced that\\nonly through reform, the strengthening of democracy\\nand the rule of law can lasting stability be guaranteed.\\nThe free and fair parliamentary elections in Palestine\\nand Lebanon are encouraging signs of change.\\nThe Middle East peace process has also gained\\nnew momentum over past months. We emphatically\\nwelcome the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip\\nand the northern part of the West Bank. Now it is vital\\nthat Israelis, Palestinians and the international\\ncommunity do all they can to lay the foundations for\\npolitical and economic stability in the Gaza Strip.\\nEfforts should be focused on a two-State solution based\\non the road map. The objective remains a viable\\nPalestinian State, living side by side with Israel within\\nsecure and recognized borders.\\nThe international community is united in its\\ndetermination to help Iraq establish democracy and the\\nrule of law. We want all Iraqis to be able to live free\\nfrom fear and material hardship. The forces of terror\\nand violence must not and shall not be permitted to win\\nthe upper hand. The Middle East needs a stable,\\nprosperous Iraq.\\nHere, too, the United Nations is making its\\ncontribution towards the process of political transition\\nand reconstruction. That is why we have provided\\nconsiderable financial assistance for the protection\\nforce whose presence allows the United Nations to\\nwork in Iraq. It is also why Germany has, at Iraq’s\\nrequest, advised that country on constitutional issues.\\n34\\n\\nThe Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a\\nmajor cause of concern. Past violations of international\\nobligations, a lack of transparency in its actions, and\\ninsufficient cooperation with subsequent investigations\\nhave destroyed any confidence that the programme is\\nfor exclusively peaceful purposes. With support from\\nthe EU High Representative, Germany, France and the\\nUnited Kingdom have worked with Iran on finding a\\nway to restore confidence. Those efforts have received\\nbroad support from the international community.\\nTehran’s continued disregard of International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency decisions, however, is further\\nweakening that confidence and the gains made to date\\nare being put at risk for no good reason. We should\\nemphasize that our concerns do not relate to Iran’s\\nright to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\\nThis has never been and will not be put in\\nquestion. Our concerns do not relate to Iran’s right to\\nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That has\\nnever been and will not be called into question.\\nWe remain prepared to work on solutions which\\ninclude objective guarantees that the Iranian nuclear\\nprogramme can serve only peaceful ends. I appeal to\\nIran to refrain from taking unilateral measures and to\\nreturn to the negotiating table.\\nThere is general agreement that the proliferation\\nof weapons of mass destruction is now more than ever\\na life-threatening risk to us all. It is thus all the more\\nregrettable that no consensus could be reached on the\\ninclusion in the outcome document of a chapter on\\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. If we want to\\nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction, in particular of nuclear weapons, all States\\nmust fulfil their obligations. At the same time, new\\nmomentum must be brought to the process of nuclear\\ndisarmament.\\nIn that context, I welcome the latest progress made\\nby the six-party talks towards resolving the nuclear\\ncrisis on the Korean peninsula. It is a vital first step.\\nAfrica is in many ways a touchstone for and an\\nexample of an effective multilateral system. The close\\ncooperation of the United Nations with the African\\nUnion, as well as with the Economic Community of\\nWest African States (ECOWAS), has had a beneficial\\nimpact in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and,\\nrecently, in Burundi. The United Nations is also\\nplaying an equally important role in efforts to stabilize\\nthe Great Lakes region.\\nFollowing the death of John Garang, the peace\\nprocess in the Sudan requires an even greater\\ncommitment by all parties to implement the historic\\nNairobi peace agreement. The United Nations Mission\\nin the Sudan (UNMIS), to which Germany has\\ncontributed personnel, is making a major contribution.\\nHowever, we must not neglect other crisis areas, in\\nparticular Darfur. The African Union mission in Darfur\\nhas helped to stabilize the security situation in the area\\nwhere it is stationed.\\nThe variety of problems facing us — poverty, social\\npolarization, global population growth, inadequate water\\nsupplies and global climate change, to name only the\\nmost pressing — serves to highlight the need for\\nconcerted action. We must prepare the United Nations\\nfor the challenges of the twenty-first century.\\nOver the past 12 months, reform of the United\\nNations has been intensively debated. Member States,\\nthe High-level Panel and the Secretary-General himself\\nhave provided valuable input. Some of their proposals\\nare contained in the outcome document adopted at last\\nweek’s world summit.\\nHowever, only when we have managed to\\nimplement those proposals will we be able to speak of\\ntrue achievement. To be a success, the process requires\\nthe active participation of all Member States.\\nThe tasks that the summit has set the General\\nAssembly must be tackled with speed and focus. At\\nthis session, the General Assembly must make a\\nbreakthrough towards the adoption of the\\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\\nIt must also work on the creation of a Peacebuilding\\nCommission.\\nSustainable peace requires more than merely\\nrestoring security. The post-conflict peacebuilding\\nphase is particularly crucial. The sooner reconstruction\\ncan begin, and the better coordinated the peacemaking\\nand post-conflict recovery efforts are, the better the\\nchances of lasting stabilization. The summit took a\\nvital step in that direction by deciding to establish the\\nPeacebuilding Commission by the end of the year.\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report\\nentitled “In larger freedom”, states that:\\n“No security agenda and no drive for\\ndevelopment will be successful unless they are\\nbased on … respect for human dignity”.\\n(A/59/2005, para. 128)\\n35\\n\\nIf we wish to lend greater weight to the\\nprotection and promotion of human rights, we must\\nalso strengthen the relevant United Nations bodies and\\nmechanisms.\\nGermany therefore welcomes the decision taken\\nby the summit to create a Human Rights Council which\\nwill replace the Commission on Human Rights. The\\nGeneral Assembly must now move fast to define the\\nmandate and structures of the Human Rights Council.\\nIt must ensure that the new body enjoys greater\\nlegitimacy than its predecessor and that its working\\nmethods are more effective, especially when it comes\\nto responding to acute crises.\\nAllow me a last word. A glance at the trouble\\nspots around the world makes it clear that we, the\\ninternational community, face far more conflicts in the\\nSouth than we do in the North. Key decisions on\\nsettling those conflicts are taken in the Security\\nCouncil which, under the Charter of the United\\nNations, has primary responsibility for the maintenance\\nof peace. Its composition, however, still reflects the\\nworld of 1945 and not that of the twenty-first century.\\nAdjusting and expanding the membership of the\\nSecurity Council by adding both permanent and non-\\npermanent members thus remains essential. Any reform\\nof the United Nations that does not include reform of the\\nSecurity Council is not worthy of the name.\\nThe Security Council is in danger of losing its\\nauthority and legitimacy as long as entire continents\\nand major contributors are not adequately represented.\\nGermany and its partners Brazil, India and Japan\\ntherefore have submitted a proposal on reform of the\\nCouncil. It is the only proposal that includes a\\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council and its\\nworking methods. We are convinced that it is the only\\nproposal capable of obtaining the necessary two-thirds\\nmajority in the General Assembly.\\nReform of the Security Council is an\\nindispensable part of the overhaul of the United\\nNations. In last week’s summit document, we all\\npledged to swiftly advance those reforms. We do not\\nneed only progress; we need results. The time is ripe\\nfor radical reform. Let us use this session of the\\nGeneral Assembly to finally resolve this issue, which is\\nso vital to the future of the United Nations.', \"I would like to congratulate you,\\nMr. Eliasson, on your election to the presidency of the\\nGeneral Assembly and to assure you of my country's\\nfull support during this sixtieth session of the General\\nAssembly.\\nReform will be a central theme at the Assembly's\\nsixtieth session. Allow me to focus on four institutional\\nreforms, by which Switzerland sets great store. They\\nare, first of all, the creation of a Human Rights\\nCouncil; secondly, reform of the Security Council;\\nthirdly, the Peacebuilding Commission; and, fourthly,\\ninternal management of the United Nations.\\nThe creation of a Human Rights Council is\\ncrucial. The Commission on Human Rights in its\\npresent form suffers from various defects. We deplore\\nits weak capacity to respond to grave human rights\\nviolations. We also regret its overly selective character\\nand the application of double standards, which\\nundermine its authority.\\nSwitzerland welcomes the decision made by the\\nMember States at the summit to replace the\\nCommission on Human Rights with a Human Rights\\nCouncil. However, we regret that it has not been\\npossible, even at this stage, to establish some of the\\nworking methods on which there was wide agreement.\\nFor Switzerland, this Human Rights Council\\nshould be a principal organ of the United Nations or\\nshould at least be directly subordinate to the General\\nAssembly. It should convene periodically, be based in\\nGeneva and should work in close cooperation with the\\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\\nHuman Rights. It should be of a size that guarantees\\nboth its legitimacy and the capacity to work effectively.\\nFinally, to ensure real added value, it should incorporate\\nthose instruments that constitute the strength of the\\npresent Commission without reproducing its defects.\\nThe profile and working methods of the Human\\nRights Council should be established promptly. We\\nhave given ourselves until the end of the sixtieth\\nsession of the General Assembly to do this, but the\\nideal solution would be to complete the work before\\nthe next session of the Commission on Human Rights,\\nwhich starts next March.\\nWe now need a clearer picture of the process\\nwhich the President of the General Assembly intends to\\nconduct. We assure him of our strong support in this\\ntask. Switzerland hopes that the future Human Rights\\nCouncil can start its work soon, and it invites all States\\nto strive towards this goal.\\nSwitzerland has also been actively involved in the\\nreform of the Security Council, an organ that embodies\\nboth the strengths and the weaknesses of the United\\nNations. No one can deny that the composition of the\\nSecurity Council should better reflect contemporary\\ngeopolitical realities. Enlargement of the Security\\nCouncil will make it more representative and will\\nstrengthen the authority of its decisions. However,\\nenlargement of the Security Council, which has been\\nthe subject of intensive debate over the past few\\nmonths, is only one aspect of the reform that needs to\\nbe made. It should not overshadow another\\nindispensable part of the reform: the need to improve\\nthe Council’s working methods.\\nFor most countries, opportunities to sit on the\\nSecurity Council are few and limited in time. A serious\\nreform of the Council's working methods would have\\nan immediate and beneficial effect for all Member\\nStates. New and more detailed rules should be adopted\\nin a General Assembly resolution and then written into\\nthe Security Council's rules of procedure.\\nReform of the Security Council’s working\\nmethods must achieve several goals: it should increase\\nthe possibilities for participation by States that are not\\nmembers of the Council; it should ensure greater\\naccountability of the Council to all the Member States\\nof the United Nations; and, finally, it should improve\\ntransparency and find new ways for the Council to hear\\nother points of view.\\nEfficiency is a fourth criterion that needs to be\\ntaken into account. Improvements in the working methods\\nof the Security Council must be geared towards\\nstrengthening its capacity to efficiently exercise its\\nresponsibilities for international peacekeeping and\\nsecurity.\\nIn May Switzerland presented a series of specific\\nrecommendations that were well received by many\\nMember States. I would like to focus on three specific\\nproposals.\\nFirst, in accordance with the principle of the\\nresponsibility to protect, the right of veto must not be\\n18\\n\\nexercised in cases of genocide, ethnic cleansing or\\nother grave and large-scale violations of international\\nhumanitarian law or human rights. I believe that that\\nprinciple is sufficiently clear not to require further\\nelaboration.\\nSecondly, the Security Council should refrain, as\\nfar as possible, from exercising legislative functions.\\nThe task of codifying and developing international law\\nshould remain the primary responsibility of the General\\nAssembly, which includes all Member States. The\\nCouncil is authorized by the United Nations Charter to\\ntake emergency measures to maintain international\\npeace and security. However, that authorization cannot\\nbe interpreted as including the power to impose\\nlegislative obligations, that is, obligations that are\\ngeneral in scope, abstract and have no time limits.\\nThirdly, on the subject of Security Council\\nsanctions, the procedures for establishing and revising\\nthe lists of targeted individuals and entities must be\\nimproved. It is unacceptable that people who are\\nsubject to sanctions that affect their basic rights are\\ndenied all right of appeal. In particular, it is important\\nto ensure the right to be heard, which is a fundamental\\nhuman right.\\nSwitzerland, together with other countries,\\nintends to present a draft resolution on improving the\\nworking methods of the Security Council.\\nAnother important institutional reform decided at\\nthe summit is the creation of a Peacebuilding\\nCommission. Switzerland has contributed its ideas to\\nthat project over the past few months. It welcomes the\\ncreation of that body, which will address a key area of\\nUnited Nations activities and fill a clear institutional\\ngap.\\nOnce a conflict has ended, the main players -\\ninstitutions, States and civil society - must work\\ntogether to rebuild the country. The principal mission\\nof the Peacebuilding Commission will be to bring those\\nplayers from the fields of peacekeeping, humanitarian\\naid, and development together to define joint strategies\\nfor future action.\\nThe Commission will include representatives of\\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\\nCouncil, as well as representatives of the principal\\nfinancial donors and troop contributors. Switzerland\\nbelieves that the main United Nations institutions\\nconcerned should also take part in the deliberations.\\nFor instance, it would be useful to include the\\nChairman of the United Nations Development Group,\\nthe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs\\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It\\nwould also be useful to bring on board, as needed,\\nexperts from civil society, the academic world or the\\nprivate sector.\\nFurthermore, in the composition of the\\nCommission, we need to ensure gender parity.\\nPeacekeeping, humanitarian action and\\ndevelopment are parallel activities and should not be\\nrigidly divided into successive phases. In drafting its\\nmandate, we should ensure that the Commission has\\nthe ability to advise all the institutional actors\\nconcerned at any step of the peace and reconstruction\\nprocess.\\nWe cannot speak of improving the efficiency of\\nthe Security Council without discussing the\\nimprovements that have to be made in the internal\\nmanagement of the United Nations. The Summit\\nOutcome document sets out the most urgently needed\\nmeasures. They must be implemented without delay.\\nIn that context, the three following factors must\\nbe taken into account: first, the political competence\\nand responsibility to decide the budget belong to the\\nGeneral Assembly; secondly, the Secretary-General's\\nmanagement authority must be extended; and, thirdly,\\nthe internal oversight bodies must be strengthened.\\nThe scandals that have tarnished the image of the\\nUnited Nations in recent months underscore the urgent\\nneed to strengthen the means as well as the financial\\nand operational independence of the Office of Internal\\nOversight Services. Furthermore, given the increasing\\ncomplexity of their task, we must strengthen\\ncooperation between the various oversight bodies,\\nwhich are spread across the United Nations system. We\\ninvite the Member States to support the enlargement of\\nthe mandate of the Office of Internal Oversight\\nServices, so that it is able to respond to requests for\\nassistance from the specialized agencies.\\nEspecially close to my heart is the importance of\\ncombating cases of abuse and sexual exploitation\\ncommitted in the context of United Nations peace\\noperations. Such abuses are a grave violation of human\\nrights and of the values that the Organization espouses.\\nThey damage the credibility of the Organization and\\nhinder the accomplishment of its missions on the\\n19\\n\\nground. Switzerland advocates zero tolerance on this\\nquestion. We strongly support the measures that have\\nrecently been taken, in particular an increase in the\\nnumber of resident investigators deployed on the\\nground under the authority of the Office of Internal\\nOversight Services.\\nLast autumn, we embarked together on a major\\nundertaking: adapting the multilateral system so that it\\ncan address the new problems and challenges of the\\ntwenty-first century, with a strengthened and more\\nefficient United Nations at its centre. All reform\\nrequires a subtle mix of ambition, realism and patience.\\nWe have come part of the way. The basic itinerary was\\nset at the summit. We must now pursue the path of\\nreform, give shape to our early decisions, and resolve\\npersisting differences. That has to be one of the main\\nobjectives of the sixtieth session of the General\\nAssembly, which has just begun.\", 'It is my firm opinion that\\nwe achieved important results at our summit. We\\ncreated a peacebuilding commission and agreed to\\nestablish a human rights council. We have good\\nlanguage on development, including unanimous\\nagreement on the Millennium Development Goals, and\\nwe agreed on the responsibility to protect. We made\\nprogress towards consensus on the fight against\\nterrorism and agreed on some essential management\\nand reform issues.\\nSome have expressed disappointment about the\\nresults of the summit and, indeed, not all of our\\nambitions were achieved. Does that imply that it is\\nwrong to be ambitious? Of course not. In a world\\nsociety of 191 Member States, we must accept that the\\nend result of negotiations will always reflect a\\ncompromise between different ambitions, and that we\\nhave to be tolerant of each other’s diverse views and\\ninterests.\\nAs regards my own country’s expectations, it is a\\nmatter of concern that we did not agree on any\\nmeasures to counter the proliferation of weapons of\\nmass destruction — one of the greatest threats to\\nhumankind. We had also hoped for more specific\\nagreement on the modalities for the human rights\\ncouncil and would have preferred clear parameters for\\nthe use of force, as well as solid language on the\\nInternational Criminal Court. And the Netherlands\\nwould have liked to give the Secretary-General more\\nscope to carry out his management responsibilities.\\nBut all in all, we have made clear progress. So let\\nus now agree to remain ambitious, to move forward\\nwith implementing the programme we have agreed, and\\nto allow the United Nations to deliver on our promises.\\nI look forward to the outline of work the President of\\nthis Assembly has announced, and I fully support the\\naccountability pact with which the Secretary-General\\nhas challenged us.\\nWe have also achieved something else, something\\nless apparent but equally important. We have\\nreaffirmed our political and moral support for a\\nfundamental underlying principle, namely, that we\\nneed to build bridges through dialogue and cooperation\\nand that we have to promote respect and tolerance. And\\nwe all share the conviction that, in promoting respect\\nand tolerance across the globe, the United Nations has\\na central role to play.\\nAccording to a well-known saying, there is only\\none thing we cannot tolerate, and that is intolerance.\\nIndeed, the struggle to protect tolerance from\\nintolerance is one of the great challenges of our time.\\nIt is in the interest of all States to take up the\\nfight against radical ideologies that turn people into\\nterrorists. Terrorism, as we all know, is a cross-border\\nthreat. People of all persuasions and beliefs are its\\ninnocent victims. And so we must respond collectively,\\nboth to terrorism and to the radical ideologies that feed\\nand breed it. Rwanda and the wars in the former\\nYugoslavia are sharp reminders of how the political use\\nof intolerant and racist rhetoric can even lead to\\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing.\\nStill, I do not believe there is or will be a clash of\\ncivilizations. But there is a clash between the tolerant\\nand the intolerant within and across our societies,\\nwithin and across our civilizations.\\nThat is why it is now so important to take on the\\nradical ideologies that foster violent extremism.\\nSecurity Council resolution 1624 (2005), calling on all\\nStates to prohibit, by law, incitement to commit a\\nterrorist act or acts, sends an important message to the\\nhate-mongers.\\nTo fight an effective battle against violent\\nextremism and terrorism, we must strike a careful\\nbalance between judicial and police measures, on the\\none hand, and meaningful dialogue on the other. Let us\\nlearn from each other in that respect. I believe that peer\\nreview in the human rights council could, in future,\\nhelp us all to maintain that careful balance.\\nLet us invest in a global culture of tolerance and\\nmutual respect. We must not look at cultural, religious\\nand ideological differences as unbridgeable divides\\nseparating adversaries. Instead, we should join forces\\nfor a global society in which the quest for greater unity\\ngoes hand in hand with respect for diversity.\\n22\\n\\nThe best way for societies to protect tolerance is\\nfor them to treasure their identity and, at the same\\ntime, dare to reassess the validity of their prevailing\\nnorms and standards. Recent events in the Netherlands,\\nfor example, have confronted our society with the\\nquestion of how to protect our centuries-old tradition\\nof tolerance from those who would abuse it to sow\\nhatred and division. That process of reflection is an\\nongoing one, but part of the answer is to constantly\\nremind ourselves that it is wrong to hold an entire\\ncommunity accountable for the deeds of individuals.\\nLet us all vow to protect tolerance from\\nintolerance. Let us invest in mutual respect and try to\\nchange the mindset of those who propagate intolerance\\nand violent extremism. That will require permanent\\ndialogue, with a central role for the United Nations, the\\nonly truly global platform we possess.\\nSerious dialogue can also help to clear up\\nmisunderstandings. One of the most striking\\nmisunderstandings concerns the nature of secularism,\\nby which I mean the separation of State and religious\\ninstitutions. That separation protects the freedom of all\\ncitizens of all religious backgrounds, as well as of\\npeople who do not practice any religion. In the\\nNetherlands, as elsewhere, politicians and political\\nparties may be inspired by religion, as long as the\\ninstitutions remain separate.\\nThat is precisely why, in my country and across\\nthe European continent, there is a place for Islam, just\\nas there is a place for other religions. There is a place\\nfor any form of Islam that allows believers to be both\\nMuslims and citizens of a democratic society.\\nCitizenship means more than just holding a\\npassport. True citizenship calls for an active\\ncontribution to the society of which one is a part. It\\nalso calls for a society that is open to the many and\\nvaried contributions of all its citizens. Radical\\nideologies that push people to isolate themselves from\\nthe rest of society and to reject or even attack the spirit\\nof democracy will run up against our determined\\nrefusal to give even one inch, in my country and, I\\nhope, everywhere. For intolerance is a global, cross-\\nborder phenomenon, which is why we so urgently need\\nthe United Nations at our side.\\nUnited Nations reform will mean making good on\\nour promises. It will require determined\\nimplementation of the plans and proposals we have\\nagreed on. If we are serious about our effort to build a\\nmore humane, dignified and just world, United Nations\\nreform must also strengthen the protection of tolerance\\nfrom intolerance.\\nIn our fast-changing world, people long for safety\\nand certainty, and that is understandable. But leaders\\nall over the world have a duty to explain that narrow\\nworldviews, with no place for differences, can offer no\\ngenuine protection. Without respect for diversity, there\\ncan be no unity.\\nIf we want to protect tolerance from intolerance,\\nwe should look critically at what we teach our children.\\nHow can we expect them to become tolerant adults if\\nthey learn in school to despise people of other faiths\\nand ethnicities? It is not enough for Governments to do\\npolite business with other Governments; they should,\\nat the same time, not allow hotbeds of intolerance to\\nexist in their societies.\\nThere is an old saying that we reap what we sow.\\nIf we wish to reap a harvest of tolerance and mutual\\nrespect, and foster a sense of common purpose, then\\nwe must set to work now. Let us begin sowing the\\nseeds of tolerance and mutual respect here at the\\nUnited Nations, the world’s main crossroads of\\ncivilizations.', '“United in diversity”: \\nthis motto of the European Union expresses what we, \\nthe 25 — and soon to be 27 — member States of the \\nEuropean Union, demand from ourselves, as well as \\nour aspirations for the United Nations. “United in \\ndiversity” is also a concrete management principle of \\nour practical, everyday work to promote justice, peace, \\nfreedom and prosperity. As the host country to the only \\nUnited Nations headquarters within the European \\nUnion, as President of the European Union during the \\nfirst six months of 2006 and as a venue for the dialogue \\nof religions and cultures, Austria has consistently \\naimed at translating this principle into practice, \\nincluding by providing peacekeepers, despite recent \\n  \\n \\n06-53005 36 \\n \\nbitter experiences such as the tragic death of Major \\nHans-Peter Lang while he was serving the United \\nNations in southern Lebanon. \\n By establishing the Human Rights Council in \\nGeneva and the Peacebuilding Commission, we have \\ngiven ourselves new instruments for carrying out an \\nimportant part of our work in this phase of United \\nNations reform. Austria thanks Jan Eliasson, President \\nof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session, for his \\nvision, tenacity and endurance. We owe it to his \\nnegotiating skills that institutional reform of the United \\nNations has been decisively set in motion. We pledge \\nto devote the necessary determination to the reform \\nmeasures that still need to be implemented, such as \\nmanagement reform, the review of United Nations \\nmandates and the establishment of a rule of law \\nassistance unit. \\n Today, after decades of division, Europe is \\ngrowing together again. That is the major achievement \\nof the European Union. We have come a long way. The \\niron curtain is a relic of the past. Today, we want the \\ncountries of South-East Europe and the Balkans to take \\ntheir rightful place in Europe and to be included in the \\nreunification process of our continent. The European \\nexperience is, profoundly, an experience of overcoming \\nold and bitter conflicts and of the power of patient and \\npeaceful transformation.  \\n Here, I wish to welcome to the General Assembly \\nthe newest European member and the 192nd Member \\nof the United Nations, the Republic of Montenegro. \\n In Europe, difficult issues need to be solved. \\nTomorrow, the Security Council will discuss the future \\nstatus of Kosovo. Austria supports the efforts of \\nPresident Martti Ahtisaari and his team in Vienna. As \\nneighbours and friends, we urge both Belgrade and \\nPristina to engage in these negotiations constructively, \\nin a results-oriented manner and with the necessary \\nsense of realism. Our goal is a democratic and multi-\\nethnic Kosovo whose citizens can all live in security \\nand dignity on the basis of mutual trust. In the same \\nspirit, a confident, peaceful and prosperous Serbia, \\nfully integrated into the family of European nations, is \\ncrucial for the stability of the whole region. \\n In the Middle East, innocent civilians still suffer \\nfrom the disastrous consequences of terror attacks and \\nthe indiscriminate use of force. Men, women and \\nchildren on all sides must be given a real chance to live \\nin peace and in an atmosphere of increasing mutual \\ntrust.  \\n The goal that Austria pursues in its relations with \\nthe Middle East is to realize the vision of Palestinians \\nand Israelis living side by side in security as \\nneighbours in two States, working towards a peaceful \\nand economically successful common future. We know \\nthat the path towards that goal is rocky, but now we \\nhave reached a turning point. In the aftermath of the \\narmed conflict in Lebanon, all parties in the region \\nhave agreed on the need for renewed engagement on \\nthe part of the international community. The European \\nUnion and its member States can and will make a \\nsubstantive contribution.  \\n However, international efforts can only \\nsupport — not serve as a substitute for — efforts by \\nIsrael and the Palestinians. That is why we welcome \\nthe efforts of President Abbas to form a Government of \\nnational unity in the Palestinian territories and the \\nrecent high-level, direct contacts. Yesterday’s statement \\nby the Middle East Quartet — in which the United \\nNations plays such a central role — is another \\nencouraging signal. We hope that those decisions will \\nhelp to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people \\nand to move the political process forward. \\n Austria is convinced that the work of the Middle \\nEast Quartet should now pave the way towards a major \\npeace initiative. We see great merit in an international \\nMiddle East conference along the lines of the 1991 \\nMadrid Conference. We believe that such a forum \\nshould be open to regional partners willing to \\nparticipate constructively in search of a comprehensive \\npeace settlement. A conference of that kind could also \\nexamine the longer-term potential for regional security \\narrangements. \\n As the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out, \\nAfrica must remain one of our main priorities. In \\nparticular, we must engage to prevent a humanitarian \\ncatastrophe in Darfur. It is simply unacceptable that not \\neven relief agencies are given access to help those most \\nin need. It is deeply disturbing that there is no clear \\nperspective for an end to fighting and suffering in the \\nregion. As many others, we urgently call upon the \\nGovernment of the Sudan to accept the deployment of \\na United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur without \\ndelay. \\n Austria is deeply aware of the need for the \\ndialogue of cultures and religions. This is because my \\n \\n \\n37 06-53005 \\n \\ncountry lies at the crossroads of many different \\ncultures, at the heart of a continent marked by centuries \\nof dividing lines. Our own difficult experience has \\ncertainly taught us that mutual tolerance and respect \\nare universal values, which we must all uphold and that \\nreligious beliefs, by their very nature, must never be \\nmisused to justify violence.  \\n In view of our own experience, we are also \\nconvinced that the dialogue of religions and cultures is \\nnot a challenge confined only to the international field; \\nthis dialogue begins at home, within our own societies. \\nHere, as well as at the global level, “United in \\ndiversity” must be our guiding principle. We have to \\nkeep our work down to earth. We have to find answers \\non how best to organize living together and provide \\norientation in a rapidly globalizing world that many \\nregard as a menace. Ultimately, it is in the work place, \\nat school, in defining the role of women in society, in \\nseeking to create opportunities for young people and in \\nthe media that we decide about the outcome of the \\ndialogue of cultures in real-life terms. \\n I am therefore convinced that we must better \\nintegrate the dialogue of religions and cultures in the \\neveryday work of the United Nations. This is a topic \\nthat we cannot leave to the street. The minefield of \\ncollective emotions is not a good place to discuss \\nquestions of belief. Complex feelings of frustration, \\nhumiliation and neglect can erupt in violence at the \\nslightest trigger. In a world where connections are \\nestablished by a single mouse click, reactions arrive \\nwithin minutes. Here, we need to counteract on the \\nbasis of our common values, in full conformity with \\nuniversal human rights and basic freedoms, as they are \\nthe very foundation of our work here at the United \\nNations. \\n In the 61 years of the United Nations, this is only \\nthe third time that a woman has presided over the \\nGeneral Assembly, and the first woman to do so \\ncoming from the Arab world. While we congratulate \\nher personally on her election to this high position, \\nAustria also regards this election as a signal to all \\nwomen in the world: the time has come for women to \\ntake their rightful place in all spheres of public life. We \\nare called upon to engage politically at all levels, from \\nthe community level to the United Nations. The voices \\nof women need to be heard more clearly in the work of \\nthe United Nations. Women know what holds families, \\ncommunities and societies together. This age-old \\nknowledge in all its modern variety and colour should \\nnot be left untapped, in particular in peace processes. \\nIn United Nations missions, at the negotiation table, in \\ndecision-making processes and not only as voices in \\nthe background. During its presidency of the European \\nUnion, Austria, in its recruitment strategy, consistently \\naimed at deploying women in European Union peace \\nmissions. In addition, we elaborated guidelines for \\nEuropean Union missions on how to best comply with \\nthe special needs of children. \\n In his address to the General Assembly at its 10th \\nmeeting, on 19 September, the Secretary-General \\nrightly said, “It is shameful that last year’s Summit \\nOutcome does not contain even one word about non-\\nproliferation and disarmament”. Austria calls for a \\nrenewed commitment of the international community \\nto these security goals. We also offer to host the next \\npreparatory meeting for the Review Conference of the \\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \\nNuclear Weapons in Vienna in the spring of 2007. \\n Development and the preservation of our \\nlivelihoods require sustainable solutions. Among the \\ngreat global challenges we are facing is climate \\nchange. Global warming is real. Austria is committed \\nto do her part in combating it. However, in Austria’s \\nview, nuclear energy is not the right answer; it bears \\ntoo many risks and uncertainties to be regarded as a \\nsafe and sustainable source of energy. \\n Solidarity is at the heart of the United Nations: \\nsolidarity with the poor, the weak and the powerless. \\nHere, the United Nations task list for the coming years \\nis rich with promise: achieving the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals in full, concluding the Doha \\nDevelopment Round, fighting against hunger, disease, \\npoverty and exclusion. \\n On Tuesday, we launched the United Nations \\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy with a clear \\nmessage: the international community is united against \\nthis scourge of humanity. We will not tolerate terrorism \\nin any form or manifestation. And we will redouble our \\nefforts to dry up the breeding grounds from which \\nterrorism feeds itself. Let me in this context point out \\nthe excellent work of the United Nations Office on \\nDrugs and Crime in Vienna, with its Global \\nProgramme against Terrorism, in delivering technical \\nassistance to Member States. \\n It is out of respect for diversity and in recognition \\nof the need for unity that Austria has presented its \\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \\n  \\n \\n06-53005 38 \\n \\nCouncil for the period 2009-2010. With this in mind, \\nwe have made the rule of law the backbone of our \\ncandidature. \\n Let me close by conveying Austria’s appreciation \\nfor the great personality who has been standing at the \\nhelm of this Organization for the past decade, for Kofi \\nAnnan, the statesman and the person. We thank the \\nSecretary-General, in particular for being a tireless \\nencourager, despite the considerable obstacles he has \\nhad to face at times. He is a role model for dignity and \\nconfidence. He is always ready to speak out, in his soft \\nbut firm voice, for those whose voices are not strong \\nenough or loud enough to be heard; to give voice to the \\nweak, the poor, the small and those who feel lost or \\nabandoned. Mr. Secretary-General, the world will \\ncontinue listening to your voice as it is the voice of \\nhope and steadfastness. ', 'Just \\none year ago, our heads of State or Government \\ngathered in this Assembly and reaffirmed that peace, \\nsecurity, development and human rights are closely \\ninterlinked. They also reaffirmed their faith in \\nmultilateralism and an international order based upon \\nthe rule of law. The mandate they entrusted to us is \\nbeing implemented progressively. We have established \\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \\nCouncil and adopted the Global Counter-Terrorism \\nStrategy. Our expectations are high and we hope that \\nthe results will meet them. \\n During the past year, we have witnessed a rebirth \\nof multilateralism, and I am happy about that. What \\nwe, the Member States of the United Nations, do \\ntogether in a multilateral way will by definition enjoy \\ngreater legitimacy. I have in mind in particular, the \\nrecent conflict between Israel and Lebanon, a conflict \\nin which the Security Council fully assumed its \\nresponsibilities — and of which the good offices of the \\nSecretary-General must eventually guarantee a lasting \\npolitical settlement.  \\n Likewise, it is worth noting that international \\ndialogue, rather than the use of force, is again in the \\nforeground of multilateral diplomacy. Here I have in \\nmind the case of Iran: we must make every effort to \\nresolve the difficult nuclear issue while fully \\nrespecting the principles of the Charter and the Treaty \\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \\n That being said, multilateralism, as I see it, is \\nneither a dogma nor a simple profession of faith. \\nMultilateralism is an instrument that should be judged \\nby its impact on world issues. In order to be effective, \\nit must deliver results. Only action can legitimize its \\nraison d’être. \\n Yesterday morning the President of Finland \\naddressed the General Assembly on behalf of the \\nEuropean Union (see ). I entirely endorse \\nher statement. I will now address a few issues which \\nare of particular importance to Belgium. \\n The Middle East has just experienced one of the \\nworst crises in recent years. A military approach has \\nled to unacceptable sacrifices by civilians, both in \\nLebanon and in Israel. In the face of such a crisis, \\nBelgium and its European partners have clearly \\ndemonstrated their willingness to act and have \\nanswered the successive appeals of the Secretary-\\nGeneral. Belgium, for its part, has contributed to the \\nemergency fund to support the Lebanese Government’s \\nreconstruction projects. But above all, Belgium has \\ndecided to participate in the reinforcement of the \\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), \\nrequested by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). \\nIn the coming weeks, 400 Belgian Blue Helmets will \\nbe deployed in southern Lebanon.  \\n But the international community’s efforts must \\nnot stop there. All elements of the Security Council \\nresolution must be urgently implemented. I salute the \\nefforts of the Secretary-General and of the States \\ninvolved, which have brought an end to the blockade. \\nThe two kidnapped Israeli soldiers must also be \\nimmediately released. Likewise, we have to work on a \\nsolution for the release of the Lebanese prisoners in \\nIsrael. And above all, the arms embargo must \\neffectively be implemented. Finally, the Lebanese \\nGovernment must fully exercise its sovereignty and its \\ncontrol throughout its territory. It has our full support \\nin that process. \\n The implementation of Council resolution 1701 \\n(2006) shows, moreover, that the European Union is \\nbecoming more involved in the quest for a lasting \\npeace in the Middle East. That is a welcome \\ndevelopment. \\n We all agree that lasting peace is predicated on a \\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Therefore \\nwe must work on all measures which could rapidly \\nopen a path towards the resumption of the dialogue, an \\nend to the hostilities, security guarantees for both \\nparties, the liberation of the abducted Israeli soldier, \\n \\n \\n47 06-52885 \\n \\nthe release of the political leaders arrested during the \\ncrisis, humanitarian access, the re-establishment of \\nbasic services, a start to reconstruction and the transfer \\nof the tax and customs income due to the Palestinian \\nauthorities. \\n We support the efforts of the President of the \\nPalestinian Authority to form a government of national \\nunity. Nevertheless, we will be attentive to the content \\nof its platform and to its response to the three \\nconditions set by the Quartet. \\n I share the assessment of the Secretary-General: \\nin the already tense environment of the Middle East, \\nthe region can absolutely not afford a new major crisis. \\nGiven the widespread and justified suspicion aroused \\nby the Iranian nuclear programme, I appeal to the sense \\nof responsibility of the Tehran authorities to respond \\npositively to the offers for negotiation made to them. \\nIran is a great country, with an ancient and esteemed \\ncivilization. That heritage, as well as its role in the \\nregion, must encourage Iran to promote peace and \\nsecurity and to rebuild confidence with its regional \\npartners, rather than isolating itself through useless \\nprovocations. Iran must again take its place in the \\ncommunity of nations and follow the rules that govern \\ninternational relations. Iran must comply with the \\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006). \\n A first round of presidential elections and \\nlegislative elections were recently held in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, thanks to the \\ncombined efforts of the Congolese authorities, civil \\nsociety and the international community. It was quite a \\nchallenge. The Congolese people voted in an orderly \\nfashion and in great numbers, and thereby \\ndemonstrated a sense of public responsibility and a \\ndesire to exercise their democratic rights.  \\n I pay tribute to the United Nations Organization \\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \\n(MONUC) for the positive role it played, assisted by \\nthe European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR), \\nin controlling the skirmishes that occurred at the end of \\nthe first round. The electoral process now has to be \\ncompleted; there is no other option. Calm must return, \\nand the protagonists must commit themselves, in good \\nfaith, to applying the rules of democracy. The \\ninternational community must continue to support the \\nprocess. \\n However, the elections are but a first step. Next, \\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has to establish \\nsolid and reliable institutions that are ready to shoulder \\ntheir responsibilities to the benefit of the people. The \\npotential resources of the Congo are enormous, and so \\nare the challenges ahead in the reconstruction of the \\ncountry. It is crucial that the new authorities \\nunambiguously demonstrate, their commitment to good \\ngovernance, both political and economic. \\n The international community has been a loyal \\npartner for the Congo during this transition. Its support \\nand collaboration, particularly through MONUC, will \\nremain paramount throughout the establishment of the \\nnew institutions. I hope that the international \\ncommunity will be able to continue a constructive \\ndialogue with the new Congolese authorities to the \\nbenefit of peace, stability and development of the \\nCongo and of the region. \\n Following the democratic elections that ended the \\ntransition period in Burundi took place, the people of \\nBurundi and the international community had high \\nhopes for the prospect of stability and development in \\nthat country. That is why we welcomed the recent \\nceasefire reached with the Forces Nationales de \\nLibération (FNL) movement. I fear, however, that \\nthose hopes might be dashed. The Government’s \\nreactions towards the press and the opposition, as well \\nas its management of public affairs, have cast a shadow \\nover the evolution of the democratic process.  \\n The Secretary-General himself expressed his \\nconcerns very clearly about the situation in Burundi. \\nThe development partners and the regional partners \\nshare those concerns. All possible means must be used \\nto consolidate the democratic process in Burundi as \\nwell as its development potential. Democracy must be \\nfully exercised, and responsible media, and a \\nresponsible civil society, are key elements in that \\nrespect. The rule of law must be strengthened, in the \\ninterest and with the participation of all. From that \\nperspective, a dialogue with national political partners \\nis indispensable. The new Government has a vital role \\nin this respect. The new Peacebuilding Commission \\nwill provide us with opportunities to hold a frank and \\nopen dialogue on all these issues. \\n As all are aware, these days our Organization is \\ndevoting greater attention to States emerging from \\nconflict that are in a period of transition. The danger of \\nnew tensions in such still-fragile States is very real. \\nFree and democratic elections are important, but they \\nare only one part of the process of rebuilding the rule \\n  \\n \\n06-52885 48 \\n \\nof law. We cannot lose sight of the way in which power \\nis really exercised. We must rebuild States so that they \\nare able to assume their responsibilities towards their \\nneighbours and their own peoples. They must be able \\nto defend their sovereignty and their borders without \\nthreatening the stability of their partners; they must \\nhave professional and loyal armies at their disposal; \\nand in such States, power must be exercised not to the \\nbenefit of the few but to respond to the aspirations of \\nthe people. Good governance should be at the centre of \\nthe process. \\n Since the beginning of this year Belgium has held \\nthe chairmanship of the Organization for Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional organization \\nunder Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United \\nNations. Its principles and values are the same as those \\nof the United Nations. Its fields of action are very \\nsimilar and complementary; they include promotion of \\nhuman rights, democratization, protection of \\nminorities, conflict prevention, crisis management and \\nprotection of the environment, not to mention dialogue \\namong civilizations, the combat against the \\nproliferation of small arms, and electoral monitoring. \\n The OSCE played a key role in maintaining the \\nrelationship between the two parts of Europe divided \\nby the cold war. Since that time, the organization has \\nelaborated a number of norms, principles and \\ncommitments that unite all its members, which \\ncontributes to reinforcing their collective security.  \\n One of the objectives of our chairmanship was to \\nstrengthen the balance between the three dimensions of \\nthe OSCE: political and military, economic, and \\nhumanitarian. We have tried, where possible, to \\nestablish in those areas synergies with the United \\nNations, on issues such as the problems of landlocked \\ncountries, combating organized crime and combating \\nterrorism. During its chairmanship, Belgium has \\nworked actively to contribute to a solution to so-called \\nfrozen conflicts. But such solutions will be possible \\nonly if can count on the genuine will of all parties \\nconcerned to move forward. \\n Some of the criticisms levelled at the United \\nNations are justified, and we must therefore pursue the \\nreform process, which must above all strengthen the \\nlegitimacy, effectiveness and credibility of the United \\nNations. Those criticisms should not minimize the \\nsuccesses the United Nations has to its credit. Here I \\nam referring to the dramatic increase in the number of \\npeacekeeping operations.  \\n On the other hand, poverty is decreasing \\nworldwide, thanks in particular to the dramatic \\nprogress made in Asia. While the trend of increasing \\npoverty has not yet been reversed in sub-Saharan \\nAfrica, the 2006 report on the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals stresses that many African \\ncountries are now showing long-term growth potential \\nthat could improve the standard of living of their \\npeoples. \\n I should like to take this opportunity to pay a very \\nsincere tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \\nAnnan. He has worked tirelessly, placing his political \\nand negotiating skills in the service of peace, \\ndevelopment and human rights. I wish to express my \\ndeep gratitude for the dedication he has shown at the \\nhelm of our Organization. ', 'Lebanon \\nhas again been set ablaze by war, a further \\nmanifestation of the interminable conflict in the Middle \\nEast whose tragedies have, for 60 years now, \\npunctuated the life of the United Nations. \\n By endlessly deferring its settlement, this \\nconfrontation has become the epicentre of international \\ninstability, the main source of incomprehension \\nbetween the different worlds and an easy alibi for all \\nforms of terrorism. \\n This situation is not a foregone conclusion. With \\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), the United \\nNations is shouldering its responsibilities. The \\nunanimous adoption of this resolution has brought the \\nfighting to an end. France, Europe and Asia have \\ncontributed to the strengthening of United Nations \\nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). \\n But the fire is still smouldering. It is now up to \\nall the parties to work towards the consolidation of \\npeace and the recovery of Lebanon. \\n It is now up to Israel to complete the withdrawal \\nof its forces. It is up to the Lebanese Government to \\naffirm its sovereignty throughout its territory. And it is \\nup to the countries in the region to cooperate fully in \\norder to ensure the success of resolution 1701 (2006), \\nto cooperate with the United Nations. \\n In this highly sensitive region where divides \\nmeet, the status quo has become unbearable. Because \\nthe conflict in the Middle East is a threat to global \\npeace and security, the world has no option but to be \\nthe guarantor of peace. Let us tread off the beaten track \\nof habit. Let us define a global strategy the key to \\nwhich is an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. \\n The parameters for that settlement are well-\\nknown, namely, the secure coexistence of two viable \\nStates, as has already been widely accepted by both \\npeoples; safe and recognized borders; and a fair \\nsolution for refugees and for Jerusalem. All that still \\nstands between Israelis and Palestinians and the peace \\nto which they aspire is the deep-seated, mutual distrust \\nof two peoples shattered by history and reeling from \\ntheir sufferings and ordeals. Let us now stop extremists \\nfrom laying down the law! Let us help peoples and \\nleaders bold enough to seek peace! Like, before them, \\nSadat and Begin, Rabin and Arafat! Before this \\nAssembly, I call on the world to commit itself to \\nrestoring the conditions for confidence. \\n The Quartet should meet shortly to start preparing \\nan international conference. I propose that the \\nconference define in advance the guarantees that we \\nare prepared to provide to the parties as soon as they \\nreach an agreement. I also propose that the conference \\npave the way for a new future in the Middle East \\nthrough a regional framework for collective security, \\neconomic integration and dialogue among cultures. \\n Building peace means fighting terrorism. It \\nmeans preventing proliferation. It means shouldering \\nthe “responsibility to protect” that we enshrined here \\nlast year. \\n International legality must prevail over the threats \\nof proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the \\ncrisis with Iran, confidence has been impaired by the \\nexistence of hidden programmes. We have extended \\nambitious offers of cooperation to that major country, \\n \\n \\n21 06-52731 \\n \\nprovided it restores confidence by suspending its \\ncontentious activities. Dialogue must prevail. Let us \\ntalk in order to enter into negotiations. \\n Given the seriousness of what is at stake, the \\ninternational community must stand firm and united. \\nWe do not aim to call regimes into question. We aim to \\nensure security in accordance with international law \\nand with due regard for the sovereignty of all \\ncountries. \\n The “responsibility to protect” — that was what \\nwe affirmed here. In Darfur, millions of people are \\nthreatened. A crime against humanity looms. \\nBloodshed and turmoil are about to convulse the very \\nheart of Africa again. \\n France entreats the international community to \\nward off a further humanitarian catastrophe. I solemnly \\ncall on Sudan to accept the United Nations peace \\nmission without delay. I call on the International \\nCriminal Court to bring to justice those responsible for \\nthese crimes. \\n The time has come for the immense continent of \\nAfrica, with its wealth of peoples and vibrant youth, \\nwhich has embarked on the road to growth and reform, \\nto find, at long last, a destiny worthy of it and of the \\ncradle of humanity it represents. Humanity must be \\nunited and there must be solidarity among its diverse \\npeoples. Humanity needs, more than ever, a strong and \\nrespected United Nations, the irreplaceable tool for \\nshared sovereignty and responsibility. \\n It is here that universal and sacred human rights \\nmust be defended and protected. With the new Human \\nRights Council and the International Criminal Court, \\nthe United Nations returns to this primary vocation. Let \\nus not disappoint the hopes of all those who love \\nfreedom and justice. \\n At a time when the world’s wealth is increasing \\nas never before, the separation between the rich and \\npoor is becoming intolerable. From its inception, the \\nUnited Nations has stood for the moral imperatives of \\nfairness and solidarity. For this reason France wishes to \\nsubmit to the United Nations the idea of innovative \\ndevelopment financing mechanisms such as the \\ninternational solidarity levy on airplane tickets, a \\nmodern, pragmatic and experimental response to the \\nneed to fight poverty and pandemics. In this spirit we \\nwill be launching the International Drug Purchase \\nFacility (UNITAID) initiative this afternoon. Let us \\novercome selfishness and dogmatism and give the \\ngenerous idea of a world united for human progress a \\nchance. \\n Finally, we all know that uncontrolled human \\nactivity is bringing about a sort of slow collective \\nsuicide. Disaster can only be averted if nations can \\ncome together to support jointly agreed commitments. \\nLet us create a United Nations for the environment, as \\nthe expression of the world’s ecological conscience and \\nthe premier forum in which we take common action for \\nfuture generations. France will host an international \\nconference next year to bring together all those who \\nwant to make progress on this project, which is crucial \\nto the future of the planet. \\n For 10 years now, a man has held high the torch \\nof the United Nations and our universal values. Today, \\nI wish to pay Kofi Annan the solemn and merited \\nhonour of our profound admiration, of our respect and \\nof our recognition. \\n In a few weeks’ time, we will appoint a new \\nSecretary-General, who will be faced with immense \\nchallenges. He will be able to count on the support of \\nFrance, on its unswerving commitment to serving \\npeace and justice, fraternity and progress. ', 'Two years ago, at this same rostrum, as the conclusion \\nof my statement (see A/59/PV.10), I quoted these \\nfamous verses of the Spanish poet Antonio Machado:  \\n “Traveller, your footsteps \\n Are the road, and nothing else; \\n Traveller, there is no road. \\n The road is made by walking; \\n Walking makes the road.” \\n What a road we have travelled since then. Indeed, \\nthe opening of the sixty-first session of the General \\nAssembly is above all the opportunity for us to look \\nback and assess the progress we have made, \\nparticularly since the September 2005 World Summit, \\nbut also to try to assess the work that still needs to be \\ndone to implement the noble ambitions we all agreed \\n  \\n \\n06-53323 10 \\n \\nupon one year ago in this Hall where we meet every \\nyear as a real parliament of nations. On that historic \\noccasion, we forcefully reaffirmed that peace and \\nsecurity, development and human rights are the pillars \\nof the United Nations system and constitute the \\nessential element of a more just and a more peaceful \\nworld order. \\n One year later, what have we accomplished, and \\nhow can that progress be assessed in the light of these \\ncriteria: the reality of the situation, and the way in \\nwhich the complex international situation and the \\nnever-ending future are evolving?  \\n When we look at the current situation, we have to \\nsee that areas of shadow coexist with reasons for hope, \\nand we have some cause for concern. More than ever, \\nthe Middle East is the centre of deep political, military, \\nsocio-economic and cultural tensions, with military \\nconfrontation on Lebanese lands and bombings in \\nnorthern Israel, to mention only the most recent \\nexamples. A month of war has left behind it a terrible \\nlegacy of death and injury, destruction and \\ncontamination by mines and unexploded ordnance, as \\nwell as major economic consequences. My country \\nimmediately joined international solidarity efforts. The \\nStockholm conference enabled us to coordinate \\ninternational support and to move towards \\nreconstruction under the aegis of the United Nations \\nand the Lebanese Government. \\n But beyond that immediate reaction, now that a \\ncessation of hostilities has been brought about — late, \\nit is true — we now have to consolidate the ceasefire \\nand lay the foundations of a sustainable political \\nprocess, the principal elements of which are defined in \\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006). As reaffirmed \\na few days ago from this podium by the current \\nPresident of the European Council, Ms. Tarja Halonen \\n(see ), the European Union is prepared to \\nfully play its role in this context. Already, European \\ncontributions — to which my country is committed to \\nparticipate — constitute what Secretary-General Kofi \\nAnnan has called the backbone of a strengthened \\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  \\n So the task of supporting the emergence of a fully \\nsovereign and independent Lebanon which can exercise \\nits sovereignty and a monopoly on armed force \\nthroughout its territory must be completed; all regional \\nplayers must make their contribution to this process. \\nBy bringing about the lifting of the blockade of \\nLebanon, and by concretely addressing the issue of \\nprisoners, the Secretary-General has laid the \\nfoundations for a lasting solution. We thank him for his \\neffective work. \\n I was in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Ramallah a few \\ndays ago, and I realized once again the extent to which \\nthe absence of true peace in this region has had a \\nnegative effect on civilian populations, particularly in \\nthe occupied territories, where the humanitarian \\nsituation is getting worse day by day. I also realized the \\nextent to which confrontation, violence and despair \\ntend to spread and become entrenched. It is this \\ngrievous machine that we have to stop. More than ever \\nbefore, it is clear that there can be no military solution \\nor unilateral solution to the continuing conflicts in the \\nregion.  \\n On 15 September, the ministers for foreign affairs \\nof the European Union reaffirmed our full support for \\nthe search for a negotiated solution. We welcomed the \\nannouncement by President Abbas with regard to an \\nagreement on the formation of a government of \\nnational unity, and we expressed the hope that such a \\ngovernment’s programme would reflect the principles \\nof the Quartet. Two days ago, as we know, the Quartet \\ntoo endorsed that position. \\n However, persistent tension in the Middle East \\nmust not divert our attention from Africa. That \\ncontinent continues to be scourged by poverty, disease \\nand armed conflict. But at the same time there is hope, \\nthanks to the continent’s extraordinary vitality and \\ncreativity. Although far too many internal conflicts and \\ninternational crises remain in many areas in Africa — \\nfor example, in Côte d’Ivoire; the Sudan, in particular \\nthe Darfur region, where a large-scale humanitarian \\ncrisis is looming; the Horn of Africa; and other areas as \\nwell — there are some signs of hope, sometimes fragile \\nto be sure, are to be seen in countries as diverse as \\nLiberia, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of \\nthe Congo, where an electoral process of \\nunprecedented scale is under way with the massive \\nsupport of the United Nations and the European Union, \\namong other partners. \\n The African Union is also playing an increasingly \\npositive role in crisis management on the African \\ncontinent, as illustrated by its action in Darfur through \\nthe African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). It is \\nessential that this crucial action be speedily taken up \\nby the deployment of an enlarged United Nations \\n \\n \\n11 06-53323 \\n \\nmission, as provided for in Security Council resolution \\n1706 (2006).  \\n With the creation and the operationalization a few \\nmonths ago of the Peacebuilding Commission, another \\nWorld Summit commitment has now been met. The \\nUnited Nations now has an innovative instrument to \\nmanage post-conflict situations in order to ensure \\noptimal transition from peacekeeping and urgent \\nhumanitarian assistance to restarting the development \\nprocess. We wish every success to this new body, \\nwhich certainly gives rise to great hope throughout the \\nworld. \\n Before leaving the issue of peace and security, I \\nmust briefly mention two subjects that have a major, \\nhorizontal impact: terrorism and the proliferation of \\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery \\nsystems.  \\n With regard to the scourge of terrorism, concerted \\nand decisive action at the international and region \\nlevels must obviously be taken. I am pleased that at the \\nend of its sixtieth session, under the energetic \\npresidency of Mr. Jan Eliasson, whom I congratulate \\nfor his work, the General Assembly adopted the United \\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \\n60/288). The Strategy must both address the conditions \\nthat encourage the spread of terrorism and seek to \\nprevent and act against terrorism, including through the \\nvarious bodies of the United Nations, while at the same \\ntime guaranteeing respect for human rights and the rule \\nof law. As European Union ministers for foreign affairs \\ndeclared a few days ago, that latter consideration \\napplies in particular to the treatment of all detainees, as \\nwell as to the problematic issue of secret detention \\ncentres.  \\n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \\nand their delivery systems continues to give rise to \\ngrave concern at the international level. The attitude \\nand the activities of North Korea in the area of nuclear \\nproliferation recently led the Security Council \\nunanimously to adopt its resolution 1695 (2006).  \\n Another subject of concern is Iran. In its \\nresolution 1696 (2006), the Security Council defined \\nthe main parameters which will guide the way in which \\nthe Iranian nuclear issue is approached by the \\ninternational community and the European Union, \\nwhich has been in discussion with Iran for more than \\ntwo years. If those demands — particularly the \\nsuspension of all enrichment activity — are met, \\nnegotiations on a comprehensive agreement can begin \\nand confidence can be restored.  \\n The Summit Outcome Document (resolution \\n60/1) highlighted in particular the importance of \\ndevelopment, which directly affects the fate of billions \\nof human beings. While 2005 was the year of great \\ndevelopment commitments, with the holding of the \\nGroup of Eight Summit at Gleneagles and the decision \\ntaken by the European Union — under the Luxembourg \\npresidency — to meet the target of 0.7 per cent of \\ngross national income in official development \\nassistance by 2015, 2006 has been the year of \\nimplementation, particularly with the adoption of \\nresolution 60/265, which reflects the international \\nconsensus in that area. \\n For its part, Luxembourg continues to be proud of \\nits participation — still too limited unfortunately — in \\nthe 0.7 per cent club, with 0.82 per cent of its gross \\nnational income devoted to official development \\nassistance in 2005. We hope to reach 1 per cent within \\nthe next few years.  \\n The meeting held earlier this week to consider the \\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \\nfor the Least Developed Countries showed once again \\nthat the establishment of a true development \\npartnership remains a priority and urgent task. \\nUnfortunately, that also remains true for international \\naction against HIV/AIDS, which was the subject of a \\nhigh-level meeting in June.  \\n Concerned about improving the quality and \\neffectiveness of aid to the most impoverished, my \\ncountry looks forward with great interest to the \\nproposals of the High-level Panel on United Nations \\nSystem-wide Coherence which will be made public in \\nthe next few months. The maxim “development is the \\nother name for peace” remains amazingly current.  \\n In September 2005, the participants in the \\nSummit formally recognized that development, peace, \\nsecurity and human rights are linked and mutually \\nreinforcing. To strengthen the international framework \\nfor the promotion and protection of human rights, the \\nGeneral Assembly decided in March 2006, as we know, \\nto replace the old Commission on Human Rights with a \\nHuman Rights Council. While the new Council’s first \\nsession enabled it to make some important progress in \\nterms of standards, we must now bolster its \\nestablishment by providing it with all the means and \\ninstruments it needs — including special procedures — \\n  \\n \\n06-53323 12 \\n \\nto promote the cause of human rights and to react \\nswiftly and effectively to specific situations of serious \\nhuman rights violations.  \\n Likewise, we welcome the recent conclusion of \\nthe negotiations on a draft international convention on \\nthe rights of persons with disabilities. We hope that \\nthat important instrument can be adopted this fall by \\nthe General Assembly. Another significant innovation, \\nadopted at last year’s Summit — the notion of the \\n“responsibility to protect” in case of genocide, war \\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity — \\nshould be applied in accordance with the criteria and \\nconditions defined in the Summit Outcome Document \\nso that it can progressively become an undisputed \\nstandard to guide the action of the international \\ncommunity as the situation requires.  \\n While peace and security, development and \\nhuman rights are the three basic pillars on which the \\nUnited Nations is based, those fundamental values can \\nbe fulfilled and fully expressed in real terms only \\nthrough an effective and credible multilateral system. \\nMultilateralism must not remain only a word. In the \\nlight of recent events in the Middle East, no nation, \\nlarge or small, can escape the conclusion that \\nmultilateralism offers the only viable framework for \\nfinding solutions to the conflicts and threats that \\nconfront us.  \\n It is our responsibility to provide the multilateral \\nsystem with adequate means to carry out its principal \\nmissions. We must also ensure that the working \\nmethods and decision-making procedures of our bodies \\nare defined and structured so that they can produce the \\nbest results and can best meet the legitimate \\nexpectations of Member States. Achieving a better \\ncost-effectiveness ratio to benefit our peoples must be \\nan objective of all Member States, large or small, of \\nthe North or the South. What is at stake is the \\ncredibility — perhaps even the survival — of \\nmultilateralism as a way to manage the major problems \\nshared by humanity. \\n Some progress was made over the past year in \\nreforming administrative and financial management, \\nbut much remains to be done. We must unite to bring \\nabout essential reform to transform the United Nations \\ninto an instrument fully capable of addressing the \\ngrave and multiple challenges at the beginning of the \\ntwenty-first century. \\n In that context, we cannot overlook the organ to \\nwhich the Charter of the United Nations entrusts a vital \\nrole in the maintenance and preservation of \\ninternational peace and security: the Security Council. \\nFor many years, ways and means to strengthen the \\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of that essential body \\nwere the subject of in-depth discussions, without any \\nsignificant progress being made. For our part, we are \\nconvinced that Security Council reform remains \\nindispensable. It must be carried out both to strengthen \\nthe Council’s representativity — by increasing the \\nnumber of its permanent and non-permanent members, \\nbut without overburdening its functioning by granting \\nthe right of veto — and to improve its rules of \\nprocedure in order to enhance the effectiveness and \\ntransparency of its work and, thus, the legitimacy of its \\naction.  \\n I should like to conclude by referring to the \\nperson who has guided us and provided us with \\nbenchmarks as he has led the Organization for the past \\n10 years. I am, of course, speaking about our \\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. Although there is \\nstill some time before the end of his mandate — and I \\nam sure that he intends to carry out a number of \\nimportant missions before then — it is important that I \\nnow pay tribute to him and thank him for the work \\naccomplished over the course of a lifetime devoted to \\nserving the Organization. \\n The country that I have the honour to represent in \\nthis Hall, Luxembourg, also intends to be an important \\npart of the life and the future of the Organization, \\nwhich, more than 60 years after its establishment, \\ncontinues to represent a noble ideal and hope for \\nmillions and millions of men and women. Luxembourg \\nwants to put itself at the service of that ideal and of the \\ninternational community and to shoulder its part of the \\nresponsibility in that regard. That is why, five years \\nago, we decided to submit our candidacy for a non-\\npermanent seat on the Security Council for the \\nbiennium 2013-2014. Luxembourg, a founding \\nMember of the United Nations that has not yet held a \\nCouncil seat, views this candidacy as a new expression \\nof its commitment to the purposes and principles of the \\nCharter, to peace and security, development and human \\nrights and to an effective multilateral system. \\n Despite difficulties and obstacles, we must \\npersevere, through dialogue and diplomacy, to fashion \\na United Nations worthy of our expectations. As we do \\nso, let us be inspired by the reflection of the great \\n \\n \\n13 06-53323 \\n \\nMichelangelo, who said, “The greatest danger is not \\nthat our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too \\nlow and we reach it”. ', 'We \\nrecently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the death \\nof Albert Einstein. He recommended the construction \\nof the atomic bomb to President Roosevelt, yet always \\ndescribed himself as a militant pacifist. He shared his \\nqualms of conscience with Sigmund Freud. In the \\ncourse of their correspondence, the two men agreed in \\nparticular that, if all peoples were to live in peace on \\nthis planet, the world needed an international \\norganization with which all people could identify. \\nEmpathy towards that organization could provide it \\nwith the authority to counter war. It was in that \\nconviction and with the same emotion that the men and \\nwomen of my country voted in favour of Switzerland’s \\naccession to the United Nations almost five years ago. \\n Today, I affirm that we are glad to have taken that \\nstep. \\n Switzerland may not have experienced war within \\nits own borders for a number of centuries, but that is \\nnot enough to satisfy us, for war is not only there \\nwhere bombs fall, killing men, women and children. \\nWe are all involved in the conflicts that ravage our \\nplanet. So long as these wars continue, no one can talk \\nconvincingly of peace. We can overcome that feeling \\nof powerlessness in the face of armed conflict by \\njoining together to work towards peace. The country \\nthat I have the honour to represent is convinced that the \\nUnited Nations is the most important means of \\npursuing that vision. The United Nations embodies our \\nhopes for peace, solidarity and justice throughout the \\nworld. \\n Only through a common alliance of all nations do \\nwe have that opportunity. No country is capable of \\nmeeting the challenges of globalization alone. War, \\nterrorism, drug trafficking, the offshoring of jobs and \\nenvironmental and climate-related disasters are all \\nglobal threats. They know no borders, not even those \\nof powerful nations. No State, not even the strongest, is \\nthe master of its own fate. Only through an inclusive \\nnetwork with universally applicable norms can might \\nand violence be replaced by justice. The United \\nNations has been the world’s most successful effort to \\nachieve that end. \\n Every nation and every community is guided by \\nits own historical and cultural experiences in dealing \\nwith conflicts. Nations behave and organize themselves \\naccordingly. In Switzerland, our values are based on \\nthe three pillars of democracy, the rule of law and \\nsocial equilibrium. That influences our view of how the \\ninternational community could address conflicts \\nworldwide by helping the victims of violence or \\ndisaster, establishing a legal system and enforcing it, \\nand examining the deeper causes of violence and \\nseeking to redress them. \\n The first reaction of a human being towards a \\nsuffering victim is to help that person. The United \\nNations has stood by victims of natural disasters with \\nhumanitarian assistance, be it after a tsunami or in a \\ndrought. It also assists people affected by war. In so \\ndoing, it has succeeded in building up positive empathy \\nand in strengthening trust in it worldwide. \\n Should the United Nations fail in its humanitarian \\ntask, however, desperation and the tendency towards \\nviolence increase and intensify conflicts. That can be \\nseen with brutal clarity in the Middle East and in \\nDarfur. \\n Why should the international community not \\nestablish norms just like a State does? I refer here to \\nthe Millennium Development Goals, human rights, the \\nclimate change Protocol and international law. States \\nhave adopted penal codes to prosecute criminals, bring \\nthem before a court, sentence them and have their \\nsentence enforced. Doing justice to victims prevents \\nacts of vengeance and a never-ending spiral of further \\nviolence. It also serves as a deterrent to potential \\ncriminals. \\n What is good for a State should also be good for \\nthe international community. It must treat war \\ncriminals according to the same rules. The \\ninternational community has to fight terrorism. There \\nis no alternative to absolute respect for the rule of law, \\nhuman rights and international law. The Geneva \\nConventions are no hindrance to that; on the contrary, \\nif the appropriate instruments are lacking, new ones \\ncan be created, such as the convention on terrorism. \\nAbove all, however, we must not betray our principles \\nand our values. Torture or any other illegal procedure \\nhas no place in our struggle and represents the radical \\nnegation of the rule of law. Recourse to such means \\nstrips the fight against terrorism of all its legitimacy. \\n  \\n \\n06-52737 14 \\n \\n The establishment of the International Criminal \\nCourt (ICC) was a key date in the history of humanity. \\nIt is in this Court that war criminals are tried, found \\nguilty and sentenced. Unfortunately, the process can \\nsometimes take a long time, as we have seen in the \\ncase of Liberia, and sometimes it can take far too much \\ntime, as in the case of the Balkans. War criminals must \\nbe extradited so that justice can be done. All war \\ncriminals, including those from the Darfur conflict, \\nmust be made aware of the consequences of their \\ncrimes and know that they will not go unpunished. \\n Respect for the law implies that all States, from \\nthe smallest to the largest, become parties to the ICC \\nStatute. Public international law, while it is of \\nfundamental importance for small countries which are \\nunable to defend themselves on their own, also serves \\nthe interests of large States, and even super-Powers, if \\nthey do not want to find themselves accused of \\narbitrary acts of imperialism. \\n We all know that no State can function purely on \\nthe basis of laws and ordinances. Laws and ordinances \\nmust have the full support of the public. The same is \\ntrue for the United Nations. That is why the Human \\nRights Council in Geneva will search for solutions \\nthrough dialogue partnerships rather than by issuing \\nthreats. That will take time, a great deal of time. The \\nexistence of the Peacebuilding Commission at the \\nUnited Nations clearly shows that the United Nations \\npeacekeepers cannot bring about or enforce peace by \\nthemselves. There need to be blueprints for peace and \\nexpert evaluations, together with a long-term “variable-\\ngeometry” commitment on the part of the international \\ncommunity, in order to prevent conflicts. \\n Critics who believed that the United Nations was \\nincapable of reform now have before them proof to the \\ncontrary. By establishing a Human Rights Council and \\na Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations has \\ndemonstrated that it wanted to give new life to values \\nsuch as the protection of human rights and that it could \\ndevelop new peacekeeping instruments. \\n Just as a democracy strives to involve all its \\ncitizens in political decisions, regardless of their \\nbackground or financial standing, the United Nations \\nmust not allow small groups of States or individual \\nStates to impose their law on others. A broad consensus \\nmust prevail. That is why we would like to see the \\nreform and enlargement of the Security Council, which \\nwould undoubtedly strengthen its legitimacy. Given \\nthat we have still a long way to go before that point is \\nreached, let us, rather, remain pragmatic and content \\nourselves with short-term improvements to the \\nCouncil’s working methods, in particular, the right of \\nveto. \\n Every State will try to find the underlying causes \\nof threats to its cohesion and endeavour to overcome \\nthem, and so it is with a community of States. \\n Environmental disasters give rise to mass \\nmigration and legions of refugees. The signatories of \\nthe Kyoto Protocol want to cut off this evil at the root. \\nBut, here again, all States, without exception, must set \\nfor themselves the same goals as were set at Kyoto \\nand, above all, take appropriate measures. \\n Every military conflict and every terrorist attack \\nstems from economic inequalities and social injustices. \\nThat is why we must do our utmost to fight poverty, \\nlack of future prospects and political impotence. \\n Religious conflicts are also born of economic and \\nsocial inequalities. In reality, the East-West divide is \\nperhaps more a North-South divide. If we want to \\npromote religious tolerance, we must pay the price, \\nwhich is greater social and economic justice. By \\nadopting the Millennium Development Goals, the \\nworld has set itself the task of reducing extreme \\npoverty by half by 2015. Let us give ourselves and the \\nUnited Nations the means for keeping that promise. \\n It is through dialogue that it is possible to address \\nthe conflict in the Middle East, the stabilization of Iraq \\nand the nuclear crisis with Iran, and all the parties \\nconcerned should do everything they can to avoid \\nfanning the flames of discord. Respect for the basic \\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations is just \\nas essential. In other words, no State is entitled to deny \\nthe right of another to exist. Lastly, we cannot \\ndisappoint those who aspire to self-determination if \\nthey have the law on their side. \\n When there is a clash of cultures, the response \\nmust be dialogue between cultures and between \\nreligions. We have no other choice. Humiliation and \\nlack of respect for other cultures undoubtedly serve as \\nbreeding grounds for terrorism. Since all States are \\nrepresented here, the United Nations is a forum unlike \\nany other. We are looking forward to the issuance of \\nthe report on the alliance of civilizations by the High-\\nlevel Group appointed by the Secretary-General. \\nSwitzerland will be very active in this endeavour. \\n \\n \\n15 06-52737 \\n \\n Switzerland is a neutral country. Our neutrality \\nhas never authorized us to look upon the world with \\nindifference or to stand on the sidelines. It has always \\nmeant that we have the obligation to work to establish \\npeace. We have never wanted to be, and have never \\nbeen, neutral towards victims of oppression and \\nviolence or the rules of the international community \\nand of international law. The only legitimate ally of a \\nneutral country is public international law. Neutrality \\nmeans refusing all forms of hegemony and \\nchampioning the peaceful coexistence of all countries, \\nwhich all enjoy equal rights. That is how Switzerland \\nunderstands neutrality and how it intends to exercise it \\nhere. \\n As I said at the outset, Albert Einstein concluded \\nthat the empathy that people would come to feel for \\ncommunity institutions could become the means to \\nprevent war. But how is such empathy brought about? \\nIt develops thanks to people who, in word and deed, \\ncommit themselves in these institutions and thereby \\ngenerate optimism about justice and peace. \\n Secretary-General Kofi Annan is one of these \\npeople. He has given the United Nations the face it has \\ntoday, thank to his commitment in all areas of United \\nNations activity, sometimes in the most delicate of \\nsituations. We are greatly indebted to him, and we ask \\nhim to accept our very sincere thanks. Switzerland is \\nparticularly grateful for his personal involvement in \\nsupport of our country’s joining the United Nations. \\nAnd yes, I confirm once again today, we are glad that \\nwe took that step. ', 'Please accept \\nmy congratulations, Madam, on your election as \\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \\nsession. I wish you every success. I should also like to \\nexpress my sincere thanks to the President of the \\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session for his \\ndedicated work and to wish him every success in his \\nfuture endeavours. \\n The world events that have taken place over the \\npast 60 years are reflected more graphically in \\nGermany than in almost any other country. Until 1989, \\nthe wall and the barbed wire across our country \\nsymbolized the division of Europe and the rest of the \\nworld into two blocs. Since then, Germany has become \\nthe embodiment of the successful overcoming of that \\ndivision. \\n Both division and the overcoming of division \\nhave influenced our view of the world. For 45 years, \\npeace in Germany was due largely to the friendship and \\nthe political and military protection of partner \\ncountries, which took their responsibility seriously. \\nThat experience shaped the political outlook of \\nGermans. That is why we, too, are now shouldering our \\nresponsibility, both in Europe and in other parts of the \\nworld. In the context of the United Nations, that means \\nthat a reunited Germany believes it has an obligation to \\ndo everything it can to support the Organization in \\ncreating a more peaceful and more equitable world. \\n German soldiers and police officers are taking \\npart in numerous peace missions that are either led or \\nmandated by the United Nations. In the Western \\nBalkans, Germany has provided the largest contingent \\nof peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and in Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina. Germany is playing a prominent role in \\nthe reconstruction of Afghanistan. Germany is leading \\nthe European operation in the Democratic Republic of \\nthe Congo and is supporting the first free elections \\nthere in 40 years. Germany is engaged in the Sudan \\nthrough its support for the African Union Mission in \\nthe Sudan and the United Nations Mission in the \\nSudan. And, at this very moment, German navy vessels \\n \\n \\n29 06-53317 \\n \\nare on their way to the Lebanese coast, where they will \\nreinforce the United Nations peacekeeping force. \\nGermany will contribute up to 2,400 troops to that \\npeace mission. \\n Germany supports a policy of dialogue and the \\npeaceful reconciliation of differing interests. We firmly \\nbelieve that political conflicts cannot be resolved \\nthrough military force or military victories. Peace is \\nbrought about by engaging in political dialogue, \\nestablishing economic ties and giving people tangible \\nhope for the future. If the parties to a conflict are \\nunable to overcome political divisions on their own, \\nthe international community, represented by the United \\nNations, has an obligation to help. That is the guiding \\nprinciple of our foreign policy. \\n As Minister for Foreign Affairs of a reunited \\nGermany, I have been profoundly influenced by \\nGerman and European history. On that basis, I have a \\nconcrete mandate for German foreign policy: we must \\ndo everything in our power to prevent the world from \\ndividing once again into hostile blocs. Politicians in \\nevery country have a responsibility in that regard. \\nEveryone can — and, I believe, everyone must — \\nmake a contribution. It is my firm conviction that \\nanyone who instigates antagonism between people of \\ndifferent cultures and religions is not living up to his or \\nher responsibility. \\n No one should interpret the involvement of \\nGermany and its partners in the Balkans, in \\nAfghanistan, in the Sudan and in Lebanon as an \\naggressive global campaign waged by the West against \\nIslam. In a world that has grown closer together than \\never before, we do not need exclusion or polarization. \\nRather, we need the courage to promote understanding \\nand to engage in dialogue. \\n In the Middle East, it is crucial, following \\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), on Lebanon, \\nthat we seize the opportunity to promote \\nunderstanding. I call on all parties to the conflict in the \\nregion to act responsibly. Those who want their \\nchildren and grandchildren to live in peace instead of \\nviolence, in safety instead of fear, in prosperity instead \\nof poverty, must have the courage to embark on new \\npaths rather than simply cultivating long-standing \\nenmities.  \\n The principles for a settlement are clear: Israel’s \\nright to exist, on the one hand, and the establishment of \\na Palestinian State, on the other. Those were the core \\nconcerns of the Road Map, to which, I am firmly \\nconvinced, we must return. However, if we are to \\nensure lasting success, we must do everything we can \\nto include everyone involved, even if that seems a \\nroundabout way to achieve our goal. Therefore, I hope \\nthat we will succeed in persuading Syria to engage in a \\nconstructive dialogue. We need stronger engagement \\non the part of the international community, particularly \\nthe Middle East Quartet. I welcome the Quartet’s \\nrecent meeting. \\n In Afghanistan, the international community is \\ndemonstrating how the principle of responsibility can \\nbe put into practice in concrete terms. After 23 years of \\ncivil war, political structures are now being developed. \\nMillions of refugees have returned to their home \\ncountry. Just as important, young people — including \\ngirls — can go to school again. However, drug \\ncultivation and the security situation pose a threat to \\nthe progress that has been made, at least in certain \\nregions of the country. We, the international \\ncommunity cannot allow the successes to date to be \\nbrought to naught. \\n In the Western Balkans, too, war is a thing of the \\npast; I am very pleased to note that that is so. The \\npolitical and military commitment of the United \\nNations, the United States of America, Russia and the \\nEuropean Union has played a key role in this. In \\nKosovo, the task now is to ensure that the two parties \\nto the conflict take their responsibility for peace and \\nstability seriously. A solution to the status of Kosovo, \\nwhich has remained unresolved for many years, is \\noverdue. Germany staunchly backs the efforts of the \\nUnited Nations Special Envoy, President Martti \\nAhtisaari. We believe that stability cannot be achieved \\nif the will of only the majority population of Kosovo is \\nexpressed. Kosovo Serbs must be guaranteed adequate \\nprotections as a minority. \\n We need only glance at a map of Africa to \\nunderstand how important the peace and stability of the \\nSudan and the Congo are for the African continent as a \\nwhole. I believe that instability and conflicts in Africa \\nalso have a direct impact on Europe. For this reason, \\ntoo, Germany is supporting the United Nations in its \\nefforts to find a solution to the conflicts in those two \\ncountries. \\n While the United Nations peace mission in \\nsouthern Sudan — the United Nations Mission in the \\nSudan (UNMIS) — has made an effective contribution \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 30 \\n \\ntowards the implementation of the Peace Agreement \\nbetween northern and southern Sudan, peace in Darfur \\nis still a long way off. Neither the Sudanese \\nGovernment nor rebel groups can be absolved of \\nresponsibility for the humanitarian disaster in the west \\nof the country. Nevertheless, I am firmly convinced \\nthat a lasting solution to the conflict will be possible \\nonly if we work with, not against, them. \\n As members are aware, over the past few years \\nGermany, together with France and Britain, supported \\nby the United States of America, Russia and China, has \\nbeen intensively seeking a solution to the conflict \\nregarding Iran’s nuclear programme. Let me state \\nclearly that no one wants to deny Iran the right to use \\nnuclear energy peacefully. Nor is isolating Iran the \\nobjective of the diplomatic effort. On the contrary, we \\nhope that Iran will become a reliable and responsible \\npartner in the crisis-stricken Middle East. That is why, \\non 6 June, we offered Iran a package aimed at far-\\nreaching cooperation. The package includes proposals \\nfor closer diplomatic, economic and security \\ncooperation, and expressly acknowledges Iran’s right \\nto use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \\n However, the international community also \\nrightly expects cooperation and transparency from Iran. \\nIf Iran were to prove that the suspicions of the \\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are \\nunfounded and if it sent a clear sign that it truly intends \\nto use its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes \\nonly, that could open the door to a development which \\nbenefits the people of Iran and the entire region. \\n It is now up to the Government in Tehran to face \\nup to its responsibility. The decision in favour of peace \\nand stability in the entire Middle East requires courage. \\nI call upon Iran to end the current phase of \\nprocrastination and give a clear sign of trust so that we \\ncan look to the future together and can finally sit down \\nat the negotiating table. \\n Resolution of the nuclear dispute with Iran is \\nurgent. However, the challenges of the proliferation of \\nnuclear weapons go far beyond that. We must act now \\nif we want to halt the erosion of the non-proliferation \\nregime. The next attempt to implement the Treaty on \\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must not \\nfail. \\n Not only Iran but also other countries are \\nthinking about developing enrichment technology. We \\nwill have to develop new instruments if we want to \\nprevent such risks from arising. \\n I am therefore strongly in favour of not merely \\nexchanging ideas on the multilateralization of the fuel \\ncycle and transferring responsibility for uranium \\nenrichment to the international community, but of \\nfurther developing such ideas into concrete options. I \\ntherefore appeal for greater efforts to find solutions, \\nworking together with the IAEA. \\n The conflicts in the Middle East, Afghanistan, the \\nWestern Balkans and the Sudan, and the dispute with \\nIran, as well as the fight against international terrorism, \\nhave one thing in common: in none of those cases is \\nthe West taking a hostile stance against Islam. Nor do \\nthey involve a clash of civilizations. Rather, they are \\nvery diverse conflicts involving diverse interests. \\n I believe that there is just one link, albeit a very \\ndifferent one: each one of those conflicts can be \\nresolved only with a willingness and ability to engage \\nin dialogue. That is because dialogue gets everyone \\nconcerned involved, engages them and does not allow \\nthem to shirk their responsibility for resolving a \\nconflict. However, a policy of cooperation and \\ndialogue does not mean talking at any cost. Those who \\nwant to engage in dialogue must meet some basic \\nprerequisites. In my view, these include a readiness to \\nbring about a peaceful reconciliation of interests — \\nthat is to say, they must be prepared to renounce \\nviolence and respect the position of the other side — \\nand their own position must be consistent and credible. \\nIf these prerequisites are not met, then no dialogue \\nwith any chance of success can get off the ground. \\n I am firmly convinced that a dialogue beyond \\ncultural borders can succeed because, despite all of our \\ndifferences, we are living in one world. The various \\ncultures of the world have more in common than \\npolitical rabble-rousers would have us believe. People \\neverywhere have the same fundamental interests: they \\nwant to live in peace and security, free from poverty. \\nThey want good health care and good schools for their \\nchildren. No responsible Government would ever want \\nto withhold these from its people — nor should they \\never be allowed to try to do so. \\n The United Nations and its agencies and \\nprogrammes embody this vision — and it is this vision \\nthat makes the United Nations so indispensable. I am \\nconvinced that we will need the United Nations more \\nthan ever in the coming decades. The number and the \\n \\n \\n31 06-53317 \\n \\nscale of crises in the world are increasing. That could \\nbring about a renaissance of the United Nations even in \\ncountries that are sometimes still sceptical about the \\nworld Organization. \\n The effectiveness of the United Nations, its \\nability to act and the confidence it inspires as the \\ninternational community’s main multilateral \\nOrganization are closely connected. Everyone can see \\nhow necessary transparent structures and effective \\ninstitutions are for the United Nations. The reform of \\nthe United Nations — the entire Organization, not just \\nthe Security Council — should not, therefore, simply \\nremain on the agenda; concrete progress must be made. \\n We see the expectations placed on the United \\nNations rising. This is especially urgent in the case of \\nthe review of mandates, as well as management and \\nfinancial reform. Germany pledges to support this \\nendeavour, because we must reform if we, as members \\nof the international community, wish to remain \\neffective. We owe that not only to the United Nations \\nbut, above all, to the people in whose name we \\nshoulder responsibility together. ', 'Five years after the \\ndestruction of the Twin Towers and just a few days \\nafter the commemoration of that terrible tragedy, I \\nwould like to extend my deepest sympathy to the \\npeople of this great city, which serves as mankind’s \\nmeeting point. \\n Last year, I stressed our collective responsibility \\nto protect tolerance from intolerance. I spoke of \\nfreedom of expression and freedom of religion. Today I \\nshould like to revisit that theme. But, in addition, I will \\ndiscuss the relationship between fighting terrorism and \\nrespecting human rights, the search for peace in the \\nMiddle East and reform of the United Nations. \\nMoreover, I will renew my call for intensified \\ndialogue. Only dialogue at all levels of society leads to \\nmore knowledge about one another — and often to \\nmore mutual understanding. \\n The threat of terrorism has not subsided. To fully \\nunderstand the nature of the challenge we face, we \\nhave to ask ourselves what terrorists are aiming for. \\nThey aspire to undermine a society based on \\ndemocracy, fundamental freedoms, human rights and \\nthe quest for progress. In their view, there is no place \\nfor the principles and tenets of our free society. \\nInstead, they try by means of terror and violence to \\nimpose their views of the world on others. \\n As to the means used by terrorists, there can be \\nno doubt that large-scale and systematic terrorist acts \\nqualify as crimes against humanity under international \\nlaw. While civilized societies uphold international legal \\nand moral standards in defending themselves, terrorists \\ncompletely reject the central principles of international \\nlaw. Our campaign against this threat must be fought \\nwith great determination by all of us. Indiscriminate \\nviolence must be countered by the collective will to \\ndefend our values, in order to protect our civilization \\nand human dignity. \\n In order for this campaign to be successful in the \\nlong run, we must also place great emphasis on \\ndevelopment, fair trade and dialogue. Unlike those who \\nhave prospects for a better life through access to \\neducation and jobs, people without prospects and \\nwithout a voice are more easily lured by the siren call \\nof hatred. To deal with that issue is one of the core \\nmissions of the United Nations. We — all nations of \\nthe United Nations — have a collective responsibility \\nto give people a future and a voice so that they can \\nimprove their lives. \\n Extremists cleverly seek to exploit the freedom of \\nopen societies with the aim of destroying that very \\nfreedom. This confronts us with a dilemma: do we \\nclose our societies in self-defence, thus becoming more \\nlike the evil we face, or do we remain open societies \\nand accept a certain degree of vulnerability? Anti-\\nterrorism measures can be effective only if adopted \\nwithin the context of the human rights commitments \\nwe have undertaken. Ultimately, our defence should \\nnot come at the expense of the very values upon which \\nour societies are founded. Our citizens must be able to \\ndistinguish between the societies in which they lead \\nproductive lives and the terrorist movements for which \\nhuman life has little value. I am happy with the \\nagreement we reached on the United Nations Global \\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). But \\nnow, we must see to its implementation. It is also in \\nour collective interest to conclude a terrorism \\nconvention as well. \\n The need for interfaith and intercultural dialogue \\nis as great as ever. During and after the so-called \\ncartoon crisis, I engaged in discussions with colleagues \\nand the media in Asia and the Middle East. We talked \\nabout freedom of expression and freedom of religion, \\nand I discovered that such personal efforts are crucial \\nin finding common ground. One of the initiatives we \\nhave taken is to host the annual Asia-Europe Meeting \\nconference on interfaith dialogue in Amsterdam in \\n2008. \\n For any interfaith dialogue to be meaningful, \\nrespect for diversity is a precondition. In our view, all \\nof the world’s nationalities, religions and beliefs \\nshould live side by side, united by a tradition of \\npluralism, democracy and the rule of law. According to \\ninternational instruments to which we all subscribe, \\nrespect for diversity means, for example, freedom of \\nreligion and belief. That includes the freedom to adhere \\nto any religion, or to no religion at all. In my country \\n— and in many others as well — an individual is free \\nto be a Christian, Muslim, Jew or Hindu or to adhere to \\nany other belief. This philosophy includes the right to \\nchange one’s belief, as the Universal Declaration of \\nHuman Rights clearly states. \\n  \\n \\n06-53005 32 \\n \\n We believe that the separation of Church and \\nState and the independence of the courts are the best \\nguarantees that nobody has the power to impose his or \\nher beliefs on others. Freedom of religion and freedom \\nof expression are two sides of the same coin. Does this \\nmean that people can say whatever they want? No. The \\nright to free speech does not entitle a person to insult \\nothers. But restrictions on the freedom of expression \\nmust never go further than what is necessary within a \\ndemocratic society. In individual cases where freedom \\nof expression conflicts with legitimate restrictions, it is \\nup to the courts, not the Government, to decide which \\nprinciple should prevail. \\n Peace in the Middle East would reinforce a global \\nspirit of dialogue. We have reason to be optimistic. \\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) ended \\nhostilities between Hizbollah and Israel, unfortunately \\nonly after many innocent civilians had lost their lives. I \\ncommend the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts \\nto promote the resolution’s effective implementation. \\n The renewed United Nations Interim Force in \\nLebanon (UNIFIL) is an important symbol of hope. \\nPeacekeepers of different religious and cultural \\nbackgrounds are working together under the sky-blue \\nbanner of the United Nations, as they have been doing \\nin the Great Lakes region in Africa and will hopefully \\nsoon be doing in Darfur, the Sudan. I am proud of the \\nfact that several States members of the European \\nUnion, together with Turkey, China and Indonesia, \\nprovide the backbone of UNIFIL. The Netherlands is \\nactively considering contributing to UNIFIL’s maritime \\ncomponent. Practical implementation will depend on \\nthe cooperation of all parties and countries in the \\nregion, and beyond, including Syria and Iran. I call \\nupon them to act in accordance with Security Council \\nresolution 1701 (2006). \\n Regional peace also requires resolution of the \\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict and the Israeli-Syrian \\ndispute. I call upon all parties involved to seize the \\npolitical momentum created by Council resolution \\n1701 (2006) and engage in serious dialogue. The \\nQuartet could, at the request of the Security Council, \\noutline a comprehensive Middle East settlement. \\n In this world, we need the United Nations to \\nmanage change, rather than lag behind. We need to \\nrenew and reinvigorate the United Nations. Last year’s \\nSummit was devoted to that very task. We have made \\nsubstantial progress since then, but more needs to be \\ndone. My country’s vision of an effective United \\nNations includes less fragmentation, more \\nconcentration and more synergy. We need a United \\nNations that cuts red tape, rather than one that creates \\nmore bureaucracy. For example, in an interdependent \\nworld, it makes no sense to have 38 different United \\nNations humanitarian and development agencies. That \\nis why we have suggested one office, one programme, \\none representative and one financial mechanism at the \\ncountry level. \\n My vision of the United Nations encompasses a \\nPeacebuilding Commission that focuses on critical \\npeacebuilding needs and a Human Rights Council that \\nis the single most authoritative voice on human rights. \\nIt is a United Nations led by a Secretary-General with \\ngreater authority to determine the optimal use of \\nhuman and other resources than is the case at present. \\n As an active Member of the United Nations, the \\nNetherlands will continue to contribute to the best of \\nits ability to turn this vision into reality. The \\nNetherlands does not just preach; it delivers. For more \\nthan 60 years, ever since the foundation of the United \\nNations, we have provided means, ideas and people. \\nAnd, of course, we remain committed to its cause. \\n Security Council reform is a difficult part of the \\noverall United Nations reform agenda. A pragmatic \\napproach would be to opt for a temporary solution that \\ncould be modified after, say, 10 years. The world is \\ndynamic and the Security Council’s composition \\nshould reflect this. The geopolitical realities of today \\nmight not necessarily be the geopolitical realities of \\ntomorrow. \\n We should focus on the longer-term gains we all \\nbenefit from, rather than on short-term progress at the \\nexpense of others. Let us work to make the United \\nNations operate in a less antagonistic way. We have \\nsuccessfully tried this approach in the Group of Friends \\nfor the Reform of the United Nations, in which \\ndifferent countries, including the Netherlands, engage \\nin constructive debate to arrive at solutions that are \\nacceptable to all. \\n The United Nations is beset by problems that \\nrequire major reforms. We are united by the \\nopportunities and challenges of our time. In promoting \\npeace and stability, in debating human rights issues, or \\nin combating extreme poverty, we are compelled to \\nwork together and to coordinate our actions. Let us \\nadopt a twenty-first-century mentality to address \\n \\n \\n33 06-53005 \\n \\ntwenty-first-century problems. Now is the time to align \\nour agendas and shoulder our responsibilities together. \\nA strong United Nations strengthens us all. \\n Finally, I would like to express my deepest \\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the \\ncommitment and determination he has shown in pursuit \\nof a better world, with a United Nations that works \\neffectively for the security, safety and well-being of \\npeople everywhere. Even the rocks of which he spoke \\nseemed a light burden under his stewardship. We \\ncommend him for achieving tangible results in the area \\nof crisis management and conflict prevention and for \\nfurthering the Millennium Development Goals. \\nSecretary-General Annan’s personal performance has \\nbrought hope and optimism to the hearts of citizens all \\nover the world. ', 'I would like to  begin by congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election as \\nPresident of the General Assembly. I would also like to \\nwish our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, every \\nsuccess at his first full session of the General Assembly \\nsince taking office. He has been very active in his first \\nnine months. The Netherlands fully supports his efforts \\nto promote peace and development in the world and to \\nmake the United Nations more effective. \\n I am convinced that the success or failure of the \\nUnited Nations depends on three fundamental factors. \\nThe first is how much inspiration we draw from our \\ncommon values: respect for human rights, for the rule \\nof law and for our planet. The second is how much we \\nshoulder our responsibility as members of the \\ninternational community. And the third is how \\nsuccessful we are in making the United Nations more \\nrelevant and in increasing the impact of the \\ninternational community. I will deal with each of these \\nthree themes in turn   respect, responsibility and \\nrelevance. \\n Next year it will be 60 years since the General \\nAssembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights (resolution 217 A (III)). The values contained in \\nthat Declaration and in the conventions based on it are \\nour source of inspiration. In its preamble, the \\nDeclaration sets out our mission: “the advent of a \\nworld in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of \\nspeech and belief and freedom from fear and want”. \\nFor the past 60 years, those values have been our moral \\ncompass, our common standard of achievement. \\nWhatever our differences of opinion, we must never \\nlose sight of that common ideal. We all agree that \\nevery human being deserves a chance to build a good \\nlife. Respect for human rights and the rule of law is our \\ndeepest motive and our highest aspiration. Our \\ndiversity rests on that unity. We should not hesitate to \\nhold one another to account.  \\n As we speak, the situation in one country in \\nparticular calls for urgent action by the international \\ncommunity. In Burma, the military are shooting at \\nmonks and civilians, who are demonstrating peacefully. \\nWe strongly condemn that brutal use of force. Together \\nwith the European Union and the United States, we call \\non the Security Council to discuss the situation \\nurgently and to consider further steps, including \\nsanctions. Should the Security Council not reach \\nagreement, we will shoulder our responsibility. In that \\ncase, I am convinced the European Union and the \\nUnited States will decide on further measures, together \\nwith other well-intentioned countries. \\n When it comes to human rights and the rule of \\nlaw, I am not talking about abstractions. Every child \\nthat can go to school, every family that can live in \\npeace and freedom with its neighbours and every \\ncountry that enjoys prosperity and tolerance is a step \\ntowards fulfilling our dream. \\n Values connect us across our cultures and \\nreligions. We must not allow cultural or religious \\ndifferences to create barriers to open dialogue. Asma \\nJahangir, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on \\nfreedom of religion or belief, tells us that religious \\nfreedom is under threat in many parts of the world. So, \\nwe have a lot to do. \\n The Netherlands wants to join forces with all \\nthose who want to promote tolerance and dialogue \\nbetween civilizations. But we must not allow that \\ndialogue to put the universal validity of our common \\nvalues in question. We know from experience how \\nfundamental our shared values are. The Netherlands is \\none country in the world. But in a sense, we are also \\nthe world in one country. Our capital, Amsterdam, is \\nhome to 177 nationalities. We have learned that only \\nthrough unity in diversity can we make progress, \\nlocally, nationally and internationally. That means that \\nthe rule of law must be strictly enforced so that people \\ncan feel safe. It also means that we need to be more \\ntolerant and willing to take a critical look at ourselves. \\nStressing our differences leads to polarization and \\nsolves nothing.  \\n We owe respect not only to one another, but also \\nto our planet. It gives us everything we need, provided \\nthat we treat its natural resources wisely and do not \\nupset its natural balance. That is why sustainability is \\none of our most important values. A value is not \\nsomething that we possess. It is not an achievement \\nthat we can boast about. A value is a task, an incentive \\nto action. Cherishing values automatically means \\naccepting responsibility. \\n Membership of the United Nations goes hand in \\nhand with moral responsibility. It means more than \\nattending meetings and even paying our dues. It also \\nmeans keeping our commitments. The treaties we sign \\nmust not remain a dead letter. Human rights must be \\nrespected. The Netherlands is proud to contribute, for \\nexample as a member and a Vice-President of the \\nHuman Rights Council. \\n In 2005 the United Nations adopted the principle \\nof the responsibility to protect. In doing so, we sided \\nwith all those suffering from genocide or crimes \\nagainst humanity. It is now time to put that principle \\ninto practice. The United Nations has a key \\nresponsibility as a protector of peace and security. \\nEach of us shares that responsibility. In this age of \\nrapid communications and global linkage, nothing is \\nfar away anymore. What happens elsewhere affects us \\nall. \\n We can only secure lasting peace in areas of \\nconflict if we combine defence with development and \\ndiplomacy. We are putting that concept into practice in \\nthe Afghan province of Uruzgan, together with our \\nAustralian partners and other allies. It is a difficult and \\ndemanding mission under United Nations mandate. The \\ninternational community must not abandon Afghanistan \\nto its fate. The hopes of millions of Afghans rest with \\nus. The United Nations needs to broaden and intensify \\nits role in Afghanistan.  \\n The Peacebuilding Commission has a vital role to \\nplay in bridging the gap between conflict and \\ndevelopment. In the past year, it has worked hard to \\nhelp several African countries that are on the difficult \\nroad of reconstruction after being torn apart by \\nconflict. The Netherlands is actively supporting that \\nvery promising approach, which focuses on prevention. \\n Assembly President Kerim has drawn attention to \\nanother responsibility we all share: the need for prompt \\naction to tackle the problem of climate change. The \\nindustrialized countries   and that means all of \\nthem   should take the lead. But the countries that are \\nnow enjoying rapid economic growth are also being \\nasked to develop more sustainably. The future lies with \\nthose countries that excel in energy conservation and \\nthe use of cleaner technologies. We are not yet making \\nsufficient use of the scope that innovation offers us.  \\n The Netherlands wants to be a front-runner, not \\nonly in our ambition to sharply reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions, but also in developing new strategies to deal \\nwith the negative effects of climate change. It is \\nimportant to take climate and nature into account in all \\nour investments. The most vulnerable developing \\ncountries deserve more support in tackling the \\nproblems they face. \\n In December, at the Bali Climate Change \\nConference, the United Nations has a unique \\nopportunity to take charge of the situation and create a \\nunited global framework for addressing the climate \\nproblem. European government leaders would like to \\nsee negotiations start in Bali on a follow-up to Kyoto. \\nThe Netherlands and its European partners will do all \\nthey can to accomplish that. \\n Responsibility also means ongoing efforts to \\nmake the United Nations more relevant. The United \\nNations is the platform for seeking global solutions to \\nglobal problems. The world needs an effective United \\nNations. How can we be more effective, efficient and \\ncredible? We need to strengthen the rule of law and put \\nan end to impunity. We are not yet making full use of \\nthe instruments we have. I say this as Prime Minister of \\na country that is proud to have the legal capital of the \\nworld   The Hague   within its borders. Without \\njustice, there can be no lasting peace and no \\nreconciliation. We would like to see the jurisdiction of \\nthe International Court of Justice and the International \\nCriminal Court accepted more widely. We stress the \\nneed for cooperation by both member and non-member \\nStates with the International Criminal Court in general \\nand with regard to the execution of arrest warrants in \\nparticular. \\n The Netherlands will continue to make a special \\neffort to promote the international legal order. That is \\nwhy we have responded positively to the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s request to host the Lebanon tribunal in the \\nNetherlands. Preparations for that tribunal are in full \\nswing.  \\n Enforcing the rule of law is not enough to make \\nthe United Nations more relevant. We also need to keep \\na critical eye on how we work. Let us resist the \\ntemptation to invest too much energy in resolutions we \\nadopt every year. It is better to invest in strengthening \\nconfidence between North and South, West and East. \\nPeople and resources are scarce. We can only spend \\neach euro once. If we want to achieve our common \\naims, such as the Millennium Development Goals, we \\nneed to coordinate our efforts. \\n Several dozen United Nations agencies are active \\naround the world. We have planted a forest of United \\nNations flags in various countries. We need a more \\nunified approach in order to help the poorest \\ndeveloping countries more. We can work far more \\nefficiently if we pool our resources in a single \\nprogramme in each country. That makes demands on \\ndonors. Several countries, including the Netherlands, \\nnow fund various United Nations organizations on the \\nbasis of multi-year plans. I hope that others will follow \\nsuit. \\n The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General’s \\nefforts to reform the United Nations system and the \\nSecurity Council. Reforms are never easy, but they are \\nessential. In a world that is changing at breakneck \\nspeed, we need multilateral institutions that can \\nrespond to new developments. A relevant United \\nNations means a dynamic United Nations with \\ndynamic institutions. \\n Reforms are sometimes seen as giving up \\ncertainties. I am convinced that we need to reform in \\norder to safeguard what we all hold dear: respect for \\nhuman rights, enforcement of the rule of law and \\nsustainable development for all nations. Those values \\nare the lifeblood of the United Nations. Respect for our \\nvalues means taking joint responsibility. Responsibility \\nmeans a constant effort to make the United Nations \\nmore relevant. We want our values to take concrete \\nform in the twenty-first century in people’s lives and in \\ninternational relations. That demands unity of purpose, \\ncourage and resolution from us all. Above all, it \\nrequires ambition, the ambition to make a determined \\neffort   while respecting our differences   to realize \\nour common ideals. What we need in the twenty-first \\ncentury is united values, united ideals, a united world \\nand the United Nations. \\n', 'Please accept  my congratulations, Mr. President, on your election as \\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \\nsession. I wish you every success. \\n We are currently experiencing a period of \\ndramatic changes. Great opportunities are accompanied \\nby considerable risks. Global structures are changing. \\nStates, economies and societies are becoming \\nnetworked as never before. That is what we call \\nglobalization. \\n The good thing about that development is that \\nprosperity is increasing, and more and more people are \\nescaping from poverty. The challenge that that \\ndevelopment poses is that not everyone has their fair \\nshare of this prosperity. There are considerable \\nimbalances. We thus need a global awareness, beyond \\nnational boundaries, of our joint responsibility in order \\nto master the major challenges facing our world. \\n Climate change is undoubtedly one of the central \\nchallenges facing humanity today. I therefore very \\nmuch welcome your decision, Mr. President, to make \\nclimate change the focus of this year’s session of the \\nGeneral Assembly. Never before have the facts been so \\nclear, the consensus among scientists so great or the \\nneed for action so indisputable. Each and every country \\nis affected by the impact of climate change. No one \\ncountry can tackle it alone. Not to take action would \\nincur immense costs and cause new global conflicts. \\n What does that mean for the way ahead? In quite \\nconcrete terms, it means that any contribution from \\nindividual States or groups of States is welcome. \\nHowever, I would like to add most emphatically that \\nsuch contributions can only complement a post-Kyoto \\nagreement under the auspices of the United Nations. \\nThey can never replace it. \\n This session of the General Assembly therefore \\nhas to set the course for the next vital step: the climate \\nconference in Bali. Environment ministers will have to \\nagree in Bali on a clear road map so that negotiations \\ncan be successfully concluded by 2009. There are three \\nkey elements: a common understanding on the scale of \\nemissions reduction, a common understanding on fair \\nnational contributions and a common understanding on \\nthe instruments we should use both to protect the \\nclimate and to foster economic growth. \\n The scope of the need for action is becoming \\nincreasingly clear. We must at least halve global \\nemissions by the middle of the century. For this we \\nhave a clear guiding principle: the principle of \\ncommon but differentiated responsibility. \\nIndustrialized countries must embrace ambitious \\nabsolute reduction targets. During the German \\npresidency the European Union adopted bold targets \\nfor 2020. All industrialized countries will have to \\ndrastically reduce their per capita emissions. \\n Emerging economies will first of all have to \\ndecouple their economic growth from emissions. In the \\nlong term, per capita emissions in both industrialized \\ncountries and emerging economies will have to \\nconverge at a level compatible with our global climate \\nprotection target. \\n Such a process of long-term convergence offers \\nall countries scope to develop. It does not demand too \\nmuch of anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that \\nonly a United Nations agreement can provide the \\ndependability this will require.  \\n Climate protection will therefore be a litmus test \\nof the international community’s ability to act \\neffectively in the twenty-first century. For, on our own \\ncontinent, we Europeans know from our daily \\nexperience that   although any individual country is \\ntoo small to make a real difference   together we can \\nachieve much. \\n In the light of our experience, I believe three \\nprinciples are of crucial importance to our common \\nfuture. First, economic strength and social \\nresponsibility belong together. This principle applies \\nboth to how States treat their citizens and to how States \\ntreat each other. It emphasizes the right and freedom of \\neach individual to achieve their full potential. At the \\nsame time, it upholds cohesion and solidarity, while \\ncategorically rejecting isolationism and protectionism. \\n That is why we are seeking a balanced and \\ncomprehensive agreement on multilateral trade. In \\nconcrete terms, this means that we have to bring the \\nDoha Round to an early and successful conclusion. Too \\nmuch time has been wasted. We have to seize the last \\nchance for negotiations this autumn. Our aim must be \\ntransparent financial markets and effective protection \\nof intellectual property, as well as minimum legal and \\nsocial standards. For I am convinced that there can be \\nno fair competition without common ground rules. \\n We can only achieve cohesion and solidarity in a \\nglobal development partnership. With the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals, the international community has \\nlaid down binding quantifiable targets and deadlines \\nfor the first time. Together with its EU partners, \\nGermany has undertaken to reach the United Nations \\n0.7 per cent target no later than 2015. We stand by \\nthese pledges. \\n There can be no doubt that genuine partnership \\nplaces all sides under an obligation   an obligation to \\nstep up the fight against corruption, to aim for better \\ngovernance and to better protect human rights. We \\nwant to support Africa in particular. There have been \\nencouraging developments on the continent but \\nunfortunately, also, serious setbacks, for example in \\nZimbabwe. \\n “Growth and responsibility in the world \\neconomy” is, therefore, also the motto guiding this \\nyear’s German presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8). \\n The second principle is that we have to \\nstrengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations. In \\nmy view, there is absolutely no doubt   the United \\nNations is the place where binding joint responses can \\nbe found to global challenges. But the United Nations \\nis in need of reform. This is true, above all, of the \\nSecurity Council. In many crisis situations it needs to \\nbe able to come up quickly with universally binding \\nproposals. To do this, it must have international \\nlegitimacy. However, the present composition of the \\nSecurity Council no longer reflects the world today. \\nThere is, therefore, no alternative to adapting it to \\npolitical realities. \\n My country has over the past years been actively \\ninvolved in this debate. Germany is prepared to assume \\nmore responsibility, and to take on a permanent seat on \\nthe Security Council. What we need now are tangible \\nresults. We are by no means only at the start of our \\nendeavours. The United Nations reform process has \\nalready produced some results, such as the report of the \\nHigh-level Panel on United Nations system-wide \\ncoherence and the establishment of the Peacebuilding \\nCommission. \\n But time is short. There are numerous crises we \\nhave to deal with right now. And notwithstanding the \\nmany differing factors that have led to these crises, \\nthey all have one thing in common: they can only be \\nsolved multilaterally. The key to ending them is unity \\nof purpose. This is particularly true with respect to \\nIran. Iran has continuously worked on its nuclear \\nprogramme in clear contradiction of the demands of the \\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and the United \\nNations. Nobody should be in the slightest doubt as to \\nthe dangerous nature of this programme. Iran is \\nignoring Security Council resolutions. Iran is blatantly \\nthreatening Israel. \\n Let us not fool ourselves. If Iran were to acquire \\nthe nuclear bomb, the consequences would be \\ndisastrous, first and foremost for the existence of \\nIsrael; secondly, for the entire region; and ultimately \\nfor all of us in Europe and the world who attach any \\nimportance to the values of liberty, democracy and \\nhuman dignity. That is why we have to prevent Iran \\nfrom acquiring nuclear arms. \\n The international community must not allow \\nitself to be divided or have its decisive response to \\nIran’s provocations undermined in any way. The world \\ndoes not have to prove to Iran that Iran is building a \\nnuclear bomb. Iran has to convince the world that it is \\nnot striving towards such a bomb. \\n Each and every German Chancellor before me \\nhas shouldered Germany’s special responsibility for the \\nexistence of Israel. I, too, pledge to live up to this \\nresponsibility that our history has bequeathed us. It is \\none of the fundamental principles that guides my \\ncountry. In other words, Israel’s security is \\nnon-negotiable for me as German Chancellor. And that \\nbeing the case, we have to do more than pay lip-service \\nto it. Together with its partners, Germany will continue \\nto seek a diplomatic solution. With this aim in mind, \\nGermany will   if Iran does not come around   \\nfirmly advocate additional and harsher sanctions. \\n Unity of purpose is also the key in the fight \\nagainst international terrorism, and especially in our \\nefforts aimed at security and stability in Afghanistan. \\nUnity of purpose is also vital for ensuring a peaceful \\nfuture in Kosovo, where NATO and the European \\nUnion play a particularly active role. We want a \\nsolution under United Nations auspices. All parties are \\nnow called upon to show a willingness to compromise. \\n We also strongly support the efforts of the Middle \\nEast Quartet for peace in that region. Germany is a \\nstaunch advocate of the vision of two States, within \\nsecure borders and in peace, for the Jewish people in \\nIsrael and for the Palestinians in Palestine. We \\nwelcome the fact that both parties are continuing their \\ntalks with great vigour, above all with a view to the \\nMiddle East conference scheduled for November. \\n The third principle is that we have to strengthen \\nour shared immutable values. In my opinion, one of the \\ngreat dangers of the twenty-first century is that crises \\nand conflicts could give rise to a clash of civilizations. \\nThis must not happen. For this reason, I plead for \\ntolerance   tolerance as properly understood, not \\n“anything goes” masquerading as tolerance. Everybody \\nmust be able to follow his or her own path, but it must \\nbe a path within the international community, not \\noutside it. \\n This path is clearly departed from wherever \\nmassive human rights violations are committed, as in \\nDarfur. A human tragedy is being played out there. Too \\nmuch time has already been squandered. Now is the \\ntime to act. The crimes perpetrated there must not go \\nunpunished. This path has been departed from in \\nMyanmar, where human rights have likewise been \\ndisregarded for years. I urge the Government not to use \\nforce against the peaceful demonstrators and finally to \\nmake way for a democratic future for the country. This \\npath is also departed from when political assassinations \\nare carried out, as in the case of Rafik Hariri or the \\nrecent cowardly attack just a few days ago in Lebanon. \\nThe Hariri tribunal must commence its work with all \\npossible speed. I call on Syria to grant Lebanon \\ndiplomatic recognition at long last. \\n It is my fundamental conviction that we must, \\ntime and again, muster the strength to assert our shared \\nvalues of freedom and democracy. In order to do that, \\nwe need an unshakeable foundation.  \\n We have such a foundation: the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations. It was written when Europe and wide \\nswathes of the rest of the world lay in ruins. At the \\nmost basic level, it is a statement that, notwithstanding \\nall the dark chapters and tortuous turns of our history, \\nuniversal human rights do exist. In other words, what it \\nall comes down to is respecting and protecting the \\ndignity of each individual person. That is the \\nunderlying reason why we assemble here each year and \\nwork together for the future of our peoples. \\n Germany will do its utmost to advance that work. \\nWe look forward to fruitful cooperation with all \\npartners in the United Nations. \\n', ' At the \\noutset, Sir, I should like to congratulate you on your \\nelection as President of the General Assembly, and to \\nassure you of my country’s full support during the \\nsixty-second session.  \\n All of us here share the hope for a more peaceful \\nand harmonious world. At a time when civilian \\npopulations are the targets of suicide attacks and \\nsophisticated weapons, when children are forced to \\nbecome soldiers, and climate change poses a threat to \\nthe survival of our planet, how are we meeting our \\nresponsibilities? Where does the responsibility lie \\nwhen millions of men and women are suffering from \\nmalnutrition and their most basic needs are not being \\nmet, when injustice is everywhere, and when the \\nenvironment is being destroyed? How can we \\novercome those scourges assailing human beings \\nthroughout the world? How can we translate our \\nresponsibilities into action?  \\n In attempting to answer those questions, we have \\nto acknowledge two facts. The first is that respect for \\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance are \\nthe prerequisites both to achieving lasting peace and \\nsecurity and to protecting the environment. We know \\nnow that systematic violations of human rights and \\nflagrant deficiencies in the rule of law are often the \\nsource of conflicts. The second concerns the nature of \\nconflicts. On the ground, battle lines are being blurred. \\nState forces are confronting non-State armed groups. \\nWarlords, terrorists and criminal gangs dictate the \\nrules. Civilians rather than soldiers are the primary \\ntargets. \\n It is no longer possible to limit security policy to \\nthe traditional State framework. The focus now must be \\nfirst and foremost on the security of the individual. \\nAccordingly, Governments and non-State armed groups \\nalike are called on to respect certain basic rules \\ncommon to all. \\n If we are to achieve results, confrontation must \\ngive way to dialogue and efforts to find solutions. \\nNegotiation, dialogue and diplomacy are the tools for \\nachieving success. We must overcome the barriers that \\nexist between different sectors and disciplines in the \\nfield of international relations. We must develop \\nalliances based on shared values. That approach should \\nenable us to find solutions by cutting across regional, \\nideological and cultural boundaries. The recent past \\nhas shown what can be achieved. The International \\nCriminal Court, the Human Rights Council and the \\nAnti-personnel Landmines Convention were all the \\nresult of broad-based coalitions of countries in all \\nregions of the world. \\n However, dialogue alone will not be enough. \\nExperience has shown that, without concrete \\nobjectives, debates between players with very different \\nviews of the world can sometimes serve to accentuate \\ndifferences. In contrast, efforts to devise and \\nimplement actions that are concrete and practical make \\nfor cohabitation between different communities. It is \\nfor that reason that Switzerland supports such \\ninitiatives as the Alliance of Civilizations, along with \\nthe implementation plan proposed by the secretariat of \\nthe Alliance. \\n Coherent overall solutions to the crises that are \\ncurrently affecting the international order cannot be \\nimplemented unless we take into account the interests \\nof all the communities concerned. Switzerland does all \\nit can to promote dialogue with all parties. That is \\nparticularly the case in Lebanon, where we are offering \\nthe political forces a forum in which to seek a way out \\nof the current political crisis in the interest of long-\\nterm stability. \\n Recent developments in the occupied Palestinian \\nterritories have reminded us once again, with tragic \\nintensity, of the need to respect those principles. In that \\nregard as well, the involvement of all parties is \\nnecessary if there is to be a lasting solution. \\n The same can be said for the situation in Darfur. \\nMy country hopes that resolution 1769 (2007), which \\nfor the first time envisages close cooperation between \\nthe United Nations and the African Union, will provide \\nthe inhabitants of that region with an opportunity to \\nlive in peace and to achieve reconciliation after so \\nmany years of suffering. \\n The situation in Myanmar is alarming. \\nSwitzerland calls on the Government of Myanmar to \\nrenounce all forms of violence against demonstrators \\nand civilians. Switzerland favours dialogue among all \\nthe parties concerned, under the aegis of the Special \\nAdviser of the Secretary-General. \\n Lastly, there can be no peace or security without \\ninternational justice. Switzerland supports in particular \\nthe work of the International Criminal Court. Its \\npermanent nature and the possibility of the Security \\nCouncil referring situations to the Court   as it did in \\nthe case of Darfur   gives that institution a preventive \\neffect. For that effect to be achieved, the Court must \\nhave the full support of the international community, \\nwhich must ensure that all States cooperate fully with \\nthe Court. \\n Human security policy also applies to \\nenvironmental threats. The actions of humankind have \\nchanged the climate of the planet. Those changes are \\ntaking place on a global scale and are resulting in \\nrising temperatures, radical changes in precipitation \\npatterns, rising sea levels and a disruption to the \\nbalance of nature. Taken as a whole, those phenomena \\npose a major threat to millions of people and the places \\nwhere people live, their cultures and their living \\nconditions. The risks to security, health and \\ndevelopment are discussed in the Fourth Assessment \\nReport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \\nChange.  \\n Today environmental problems are a threat to \\nsecurity. At the political level, they require that we act \\nresponsibly as human beings. They also require the \\nforming of alliances to protect our natural resources. \\nAlthough we have established institutions and \\ninternational mechanisms to combat underdevelopment \\nand promote peace and respect for human rights, we \\nhave not done enough with regard to the environment. \\nIt is true that we have a series of international \\nconventions and national programmes and legislation. \\nBut environmental governance is fragmented and lacks \\nclear objectives. We therefore need to join together to \\nidentify and implement commitments in order to better \\nmanage resources and efforts and to protect the \\nbiosphere. We also need to mobilize the United Nations \\nsystem in order to respond to climate change \\neffectively and coherently.  \\n Switzerland therefore hopes that we will set \\nambitious goals for ourselves in the second phase of \\nthe Kyoto Protocol. We are ready to make a substantial \\ncontribution to that collective effort, in which the \\nentire international community must join. Switzerland \\nbelieves that, in order to have legitimacy, any future \\ninternational regime to address climate change will \\nrequire the participation of all countries. In our view, \\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \\nChanges and the Kyoto Protocol provide the most \\nappropriate starting points for all deliberations and \\nnegotiations on climate change. \\n Addressing the economic, social and \\nenvironmental aspects of development based on respect \\nfor human rights is both a challenge and a goal for all \\nof us as we seek to build a world that is both freer and \\nmore secure. The international community has adopted \\nmany development goals in recent decades. However, \\nadditional efforts must still be made to ensure greater \\ncoherence in the operational system of the United \\nNations. With its funds, programmes and specialized \\nagencies, the system has at its disposal an excellent \\nnetwork through which to ensure its presence on the \\nground. It also has great moral and technical legitimacy \\nand substantial operational capacity.  \\n Unfortunately the system remains fragmented and \\nits transaction costs are very high   costs which are to \\na great extent borne by beneficiary countries \\nthemselves. Major adjustments   some of which are \\ndescribed in the report entitled “Delivering as One”   \\nneed to be carried out promptly in the field so that \\nUnited Nations operational bodies can meet the needs \\nof partner countries more effectively. Negotiations on \\nthe triennial comprehensive policy review of \\noperational activities for development of the United \\nNations system, which are due to begin in a few weeks, \\nwill provide the appropriate framework to determine \\nwhat measures are needed   especially on the basis of \\nthe experiences of pilot countries that are applying the \\nconcept of “One United Nations”. \\n We stand today at the midpoint of the timetable \\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \\nAlthough there is no denying that progress has been \\nmade at various levels, there is still much to be done. \\nAll of us - Governments, multilateral institutions, \\nnon-governmental organizations and the private  \\nsector   must combine our efforts across a wide front \\nthat encompasses the national, regional and \\ninternational spheres. Given the upcoming high-level \\ndialogue on financing for development, I shall limit \\nmyself merely to recalling that all of us have a \\ncommon interest in improving the efficiency and the \\nimpact of development assistance and in increasing the \\nvolume of resources made available for it through \\nofficial channels. We already know that results in this \\narea can only be achieved through very considerable \\njoint efforts by all partners concerned. \\n The Organization has begun a process of reform \\nin order to better respond to global challenges. So as to \\nstrengthen the credibility and efficiency of the efforts \\nof the United Nations, we must demonstrate our \\ndetermination to fully carry out those reforms. There \\nwas real progress in the past year, including the \\nbeginning of the work of the Peacebuilding \\nCommission and the Human Rights Council. That \\nillustrates the ability of the United Nations to carry out \\nambitious reforms in order to respond to the challenges \\nof the twenty-first century. \\n Switzerland is advocating for an overall \\nimprovement in the working methods of the Security \\nCouncil. My country will continue its efforts to \\nimprove transparency in sanctions committees and to \\nensure that the addition and removal of names of \\npersons and entities on sanctions lists are in conformity \\nwith the principles of the rule of law and human rights. \\n Efficient management and a better targeted use of \\navailable resources continue to pose a serious \\nchallenge for the Organization. Switzerland welcomes \\nthe determination of the Secretary-General to make the \\nefficiency of the United Nations system one of his \\npriorities. Given the progress made this year, but \\nespecially because of the challenges that remain, \\nSwitzerland believes that it is essential to continue the \\nprocess of reform already under way. My country will \\ntherefore continue to support the efforts of Secretary-\\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon aimed at strengthening the \\nUnited Nations and making the Organization more \\nefficient.  \\n If we want to move ahead, if we are determined \\nto overcome the varied and interdependent challenges \\nfacing the globalized world of today, and if we want to \\nfree individual human beings from fear and want, we \\nmust focus on concrete objectives. To that end, let us \\nresolve to work tirelessly to overcome our differences \\nin the interest of the nations and peoples we represent. \\n', 'Let me address at the \\noutset a burning issue: the situation in \\nMyanmar/Burma. We join the call of many, including \\nour partners in the European Union and in the \\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, for an \\nimmediate cessation of violence. The bloodshed has to \\nstop. Democratic rights and the freedom of assembly \\nand expression have to be respected. We reiterate the \\ncall for the release from detention of Nobel Peace Prize \\nlaureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese \\ndemocratic opposition. That appeal was also made at \\nthis morning’s meeting of the Women’s Empowerment \\nNetwork, which unites women leaders from around the \\nglobe. \\n We can all feel a sense of urgency at this sixty-\\nsecond General Assembly session about the need to \\ncounter contemporary challenges with decisive joint \\naction. Climate change, disarmament and dangerous \\ntechnologies are just three examples requiring such \\njoint action, now. \\n Let me thus call for relaunching effective \\nmultilateralism. And let me make the case for a new \\nglobal partnership   the joint search for sustainable \\njoint solutions, united by a shared sense of \\nresponsibility and purpose. The very concept of \\npartnership is key in addressing the new challenges, \\nboth inside our societies and in the global village. \\nPartnership is an eye-to-eye approach, based on \\nrecognizing and respecting each other as equals. \\nPartnership is also a demanding option: anyone who \\nwants to be treated as a partner has to behave as a \\npartner. \\n We all know that none of us, not even the \\nstrongest, can master the challenges of the twenty-first \\ncentury on his or her own. In the age of globalization, \\nunilateralism and nationalism are dead-end streets. \\nThey simply do not achieve effective and durable \\nresults. We thus need both global processes and global \\nobjectives. We need to actively engage to build \\nconfidence and to counter the erosion of trust that so \\noften breeds unilateral action. \\n Climate change is the obvious challenge to be \\naddressed in such a new global partnership. The United \\nNations is the only framework in which a fair and truly \\nglobal agreement can be designed. Regional and \\nsectoral efforts need to be linked, feeding into this \\nglobal process. Furthermore, it is here only that those \\nwho contribute least to climate change but are most \\naffected by it   such as the small island developing \\nStates   can make their voices heard. \\n Disarmament, arms control and conflict \\nprevention are next in need of a credible relaunch of \\nmultilateralism and a new partnership. In the nuclear \\nage, we simply cannot afford to acquiesce to the \\npresent level of armament and to signs of a new arms \\nrace. Non-proliferation and an actual reduction of \\nweapons stockpiles thus have to make an immediate \\ncomeback to the top of the global agenda. \\n On certain limited issues, multilateral progress is \\nwithin reach. A consistently growing number of States \\nis rallying behind our call for the adoption by 2008 of a \\nlegally binding instrument to prohibit cluster \\nmunitions, which cause unacceptable harm to civilians. \\nAustria is determined to continue leading this process \\nby example, with a total national ban of this atrocious \\nweapon. \\n Nuclear technology is a third field for a new \\nglobal partnership. The world is turning nuclear, \\nwhether we like it or not. This in itself is regrettable \\nfor countries like Austria which have renounced \\nnuclear energy altogether because we believe it is a \\ndangerous and non-sustainable source of energy. \\nInevitably, the rise of nuclear power across the globe \\nwill lead to more and more tensions with regard to the \\nnature   whether for energy purposes or for weapons \\ndevelopment   of national nuclear programmes. There \\nis a highly dangerous grey zone between what is \\npermitted and what is possible. \\n A new global partnership where sensitive parts of \\nthe nuclear fuel cycle are multilateralized could offer a \\nway out. We should create a regime in which \\nenrichment facilities would be placed under the control \\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \\nThe Agency would guarantee adequate fuel supply to \\nthose who fulfil strict non-proliferation criteria through \\nan international nuclear fuel bank. This would help to \\ndissuade tensions and make new national enrichment \\nfacilities superfluous. \\n At present, the Iranian nuclear programme   for \\nmany reasons   is deeply upsetting for the entire \\ninternational community, not just for some of us. Iran \\nshould take these concerns very seriously. It is clearly \\nup to Iran to dispel any shadow of doubt over the \\nnature of its programme by providing undisputable \\nproof to the world’s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, now. \\nLike many others, we strongly support Director \\nGeneral ElBaradei’s appeal for a double time-out and \\nurge Iran to heed this call. \\n Our engagement for peace and security is rooted \\nin the firm belief that right must prevail over might. \\nSmaller and medium-sized Member States like Austria \\nunderstandably have a profound attachment to the rule \\nof law. For us, respect for the rule of law is a matter \\nnot of choice but of necessity. Together with many \\nother like-minded countries, we will continue \\npromoting the rule of law and will give strong support \\nto the newly established Rule of Law Assistance Unit. \\n Austria believes in the power of partnership, \\nwhere equality, mutual trust and respect for diversity \\novercome the crude logic of power. From our \\nexperience, effective global partnership best builds on \\nboth regional partnerships and regional ownership. \\nAustria is thus committed to developing a new \\nrelationship among equals between the European \\nUnion and the African Union, at the forthcoming \\nEuropean Union-Africa summit in Lisbon. \\n To this end, Burkina Faso and Austria will \\nco-host a conference in Ouagadougou in November on \\nhow to create sustainable peace. The meeting will unite \\nparticipants from countries of the Economic \\nCommunity of West African States and Europe in an \\nendeavour to provide a common input to the Lisbon \\nsummit   by furthering policies of good-\\nneighbourliness, the rule of law and good governance; \\nby fighting the proliferation of small arms and light \\nweapons; by creating employment for young people; \\nand by actively promoting the education of girls. \\n Together with the United Nations, the African \\nUnion is currently breaking new ground with the \\npreparations for the African Union-United Nations \\nHybrid Operation in Darfur. The human suffering we \\nwitness in the region sometimes goes beyond \\nimagination. We therefore welcome the ongoing efforts \\nto alleviate this plight, including in neighbouring \\nStates. \\n We Europeans cannot credibly call upon other \\nregions of the world to assume their regional \\nresponsibilities if we remain unable to cope with the \\nchallenges on our own continent, and in particular the \\nKosovo issue. We need to resolve the last open status \\nissue in the Western Balkans now. We therefore fully \\nsupport the ongoing efforts of the Kosovo Troika and \\nencourage Belgrade and Pristina to energetically make \\nuse of that negotiating space. The Special Envoy of the \\nSecretary-General, President Ahtisaari, has provided us \\nwith a clear sense of direction. We Europeans want \\neach and every person in Kosovo to live in dignity, \\nfreedom and security. The international organizations \\nconcerned, including the European Union, must spare \\nno effort towards that end. It is also our continued \\nobligation under Security Council resolution 1244 \\n(1999), which referred to the specific contribution the \\nEuropean Union can make to the stability of Kosovo as \\nwell as the entire Balkan region. \\n Women around the world are ready to bear a key \\nresponsibility in conflict prevention, conflict resolution \\nand peacebuilding. But women also need to be given a \\nfair share of positions in international mediation and \\npeacebuilding efforts. Not so long ago, there was not a \\nsingle woman among the 54 United Nations Special \\nRepresentatives and Envoys to conflict and post-\\nconflict regions. I am encouraged by the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s support on this matter and the recent \\nnomination of three women Deputy Special \\nRepresentatives: for Liberia, the Sudan and Lebanon. It \\nis also up to us, the Member States, to nominate more \\nwomen for such positions. \\n No conflict is too complex or too deep to durably \\nresist dialogue. The absence of dialogue breeds \\nmisperceptions and sometimes even opens space for \\nviolence. Austria has long-standing experience in \\npromoting dialogue among civilizations, religions and \\ncultures, and we will continue our activities in that \\nfield with vigour. We must actively combat attempts to \\nhijack religion for other purposes anywhere in our \\nglobal village. Religious leaders must also take a clear \\nstance in condemning and fighting practices not related \\nto religion, such as so-called honour killings or female \\ngenital mutilation. \\n Austria firmly supports the current bilateral and \\ninternational efforts that are taking place to renew the \\ndialogue between Israel and its Arab neighbours. We \\nhope that the meetings between Prime Minister Olmert \\nand President Abbas will create the basis for \\nimplementing the two-State solution: Israel and a \\nPalestinian State living as neighbours in peace and \\nsecurity. \\n We appreciate the efforts by the United States for \\nan international meeting later this year to assist the \\nparties in their quest for a just solution. We expect that \\nmeeting to advance the peace process substantially and \\nsustainably by addressing the core issues, and we stand \\nready to assist in preparatory and follow-up activities. \\nThe people of the entire Middle East region are thirsty \\nfor a new perspective of hope. \\n In 2008 we will celebrate a landmark in the \\npromotion and protection of human rights: the sixtieth \\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights and its immutable foundation, the universality \\nof fundamental rights. All human beings are born free \\nand equal in dignity and rights. It is therefore not \\nacceptable that human rights be revitalized or \\ndiminished in relation to geography or other factors. \\nThere is no doubt that women must enjoy the same \\nuniversal rights, wherever they live and whatever their \\nculture, creed or religion. \\n Our peoples expect from their leadership nothing \\nless than a life in dignity, but above all a life in \\nfreedom from fear and in freedom from want. If we are \\ntruly committed to human security, it is essential that \\nwe make every effort to meet the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals by determined, concerted action to \\neradicate poverty and hunger, to promote equality \\nbetween men and women and to protect our planet’s \\nresources. The Austrian Government has made it an \\nexplicit priority to actively live up to the rising \\nchallenges. \\n Based on our long-standing engagement for the \\nprinciples and values of the United Nations, I pledge \\nthat Austria will be a responsible and reliable partner \\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council \\nfor the term 2009-2010. We hope that the Members of \\nthe United Nations will entrust Austria with that \\nresponsibility, which we stand ready to shoulder in a \\nspirit of true partnership. \\n', \"Year after year the international community meets in \\nNew York in September to debate the major issues of \\nconcern to humankind. This traditional encounter is of \\nspecial importance in that it enables us to grasp very \\ndirectly and intensively, in all their complexity, the \\nchallenges that confront us, but also to bolster our \\ndetermination to search for common solutions. That is \\nthe very essence of the effective multilateralism that, \\nwith great conviction, my country, Luxembourg, has \\nplaced at the heart of its international action. \\n And what could be a stronger illustration of this \\nshared perception of what is at stake globally and this \\nresolve to seek viable solutions in the short, medium \\nand long, even very long, term than the high-level \\nevent organized at the beginning of the week at the \\ninitiative of the Secretary-General devoted to the \\nproblems of climate change? \\n As already said on behalf of the European Union \\nby the Prime Minister of Portugal \\nwhose statement I fully support, it is essential that \\nDecember's Bali negotiations on an effective and \\nviable post-Kyoto regime get off to a successful start. \\nThat is our most basic responsibility vis-a-vis present \\nand future generations. For its part, as a member of the \\nEuropean Union and a State party to the Kyoto \\nProtocol, Luxembourg, which has already undertaken \\nweighty individual commitments, is ready to engage \\nwith great resolve in the quest for innovative and bold \\nsolutions. \\n In order to address successfully the problems of \\nclimate change, we must tackle them in all their \\ncomplexity. In this regard, it should be noted that in the \\nabsence of concerted and energetic international action, \\nthere is a great risk that countries and populations that \\nhave contributed the least to the emergence of this \\nphenomenon are likely to be the ones to bear the \\nheaviest adverse consequences. \\n This, as I see it, is a political problem and, I \\nwould say, a moral problem   of the first order. More \\nthan ever, the issue of development and hence of \\nsustainable development both in the North and in the \\nSouth must remain in the forefront of international \\nattention. Important decisions have already been taken. \\nHere, I would refer in particular to the decision taken \\nby the European Union in 2005 under the Luxembourg \\npresidency to attain the objective of 0.7 per cent of \\ngross national income for official development \\nassistance (ODA) by 2015. Faced with the risk of \\nstagnation in ODA, we must redouble our efforts to \\nmeet our commitments. \\n A member of this all-too select Group\\nwith ODA that in 2007 reached close to 0.9 per cent of \\ngross national income, and looking forward to \\nachieving the objective of 1 per cent that we have set \\nfor ourselves   Luxembourg can only look forward to \\nthe expansion of this club. \\n The year that lies ahead is crucial from the \\nstandpoint of development. There will be a need to \\nundertake resolutely, and in a way that seeks a \\nconvergence, the World Trade Organization trade \\nnegotiations, the follow-up to Monterrey in the area of \\nfinancing for development, and the implementation of \\nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Only if we \\nadopt generous and courageous policies will we be able \\nto build on these advances and reduce the delays that \\nunfortunately persist, particularly in a number of \\nsub-Saharan African countries, with regard to the \\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \\n The convening in 2008 of a high-level meeting on \\nmid-term implementation of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals would undoubtedly be a good \\nopportunity to take stock and relaunch our efforts. Here \\nI would also applaud the recent establishment at the \\ninitiative of the Secretary-General of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group. I am \\nconvinced that this will make a significant contribution \\nin terms of coordination and intensification of efforts \\nvis-à-vis a continent with which Luxembourg \\nmaintains relations of intense and multifaceted \\ncooperation. \\n The problems associated with climate change and \\nsustainable development bring me to another subject \\nthat is dear to my heart and is at the core of the \\ninternational activities of the Luxembourg Government: \\nhumanitarian action. When it first discussed the \\nquestion of climate change (see S/PV.5663), the \\nSecurity Council highlighted the numerous complex \\ninteractions that could exist among natural disasters, \\nthe stepping up of violent conflicts within and among \\nStates and humanitarian disasters in various parts of \\nthe world. We must tackle these emergency situations \\non the operational level, seeking to make our action as \\nefficient and prompt as possible. But there is also a \\nneed increasingly to place these emergency situations \\nin their political, socio-economic and cultural context \\nin order to try to mitigate their effects and, as far as \\npossible, to prevent recurrence. \\n It is from this standpoint that a new Luxembourg \\nGovernment strategy in the area of humanitarian crisis \\nmanagement has recently been presented. The strategy \\nthat rests on three pillars: emergency relief; \\nrehabilitation and reconstruction in the transitional \\nphase; and prevention. \\n On the basis of the United Nations finding that \\none euro invested in prevention may make it possible \\nto save eight euros in crisis response and resolution, \\nnearly 5 per cent of the Luxembourg humanitarian \\nbudget will henceforth be devoted to a proactive, \\npreventive approach. \\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome, which is more \\nthan ever the road map for international action, \\nstressed the fundamental finding according to which, \\n“development, peace and security and human rights are \\ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing. For my part, I believe that this is a cardinal \\nprinciple that should guide and inspire all action by the \\nUnited Nations and its Member States from an overall \\nstandpoint of coherence in addressing the great \\nproblems of the time: conflicts in Africa   and I am \\nthinking particularly of the situations with tragic \\nhumanitarian consequences currently prevailing in the \\nSudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the \\nCongo, and, to be sure, Zimbabwe; the Middle East, \\nwhere it is important to support fully ongoing Israeli \\nand Palestinian efforts and to progress ultimately \\ntowards a negotiated solution of two States living side \\nby side in peace and security, and also towards a \\nlasting solution for the whole region; and Afghanistan, \\nBurma/Myanmar and other hotbeds of violence and \\ninstability. There is no denying that we must take into \\naccount simultaneously the dimensions of peace and \\nsecurity, human rights, States rights, the rule of law \\nand socio-economic development. \\n I would like now to speak of the courage of the \\nBurmese monks and other citizens who for weeks have \\nbeen peacefully expressing their aspiration to \\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. I condemn \\nmost energetically the violence of the Burmese security \\nforces against these peaceful demonstrators and call the \\nauthorities to put an end to it. \\n The imperative that I mentioned a moment ago \\ncan also be seen very clearly in the work of a new and \\ninnovative organ, of which Luxembourg has been a \\nmember since the beginning of the year: the \\nPeacebuilding Commission. The integrated \\npeacebuilding strategies for each of the countries \\nconcerned should take into account all the factors \\ninvolved in order once and for all to break the cycles of \\nviolence and place those countries on a stable track \\ntowards development. I would like also to mention in \\nthis context the essential dimension of reconciliation \\nand combating impunity and to applauding in \\nparticular the activities of the various international \\ncourts, in particular the International Criminal Court. \\n The protection and promotion of human rights is \\none of the key focuses of Luxembourg’s foreign policy. \\nI continue to place great hope in the new Human \\nRights Council, which has just finished setting up its \\ninstitutional structures, including, in particular, the \\nuniversal periodic review mechanism, which is a \\nsignificant innovation. \\n Faithful to its convictions and commitments, my \\ncountry fully associates itself with the initiatives \\nannounced by a group of States from all parts of the \\nworld aimed at making progress in the international \\ndebate on the question of abolishing the death penalty. \\n In this rapid overview of the international \\nsituation in the area of peace and security, allow me to \\nlinger for a moment on an important issue that is of \\nsuch concern to both the United Nations and the \\nEuropean Union, namely Kosovo. The last act of the \\nYugoslav tragedy, an urgent solution for the Kosovo \\nissue must be found. The Special Envoy of the \\nSecretary-General, President Ahtisaari, has been \\nworking energetically to establish, in keeping with the \\nestablished guidelines, the basis of the future status of \\nKosovo. The Troika of representatives from the \\nEuropean Union, the United States and Russia is also \\ncommitted to a final attempt to bring the two parties \\ntogether. These efforts have been continued in recent \\ndays in New York. As members know, the parties are \\neven now meeting in this building; I have high hopes \\nthat dialogue will ensue. The Troika has agreed to \\nsubmit its report to the Secretary-General by \\n10 December. I reiterate that the European Union is \\nready to fully assume its responsibilities in the region, \\nfor which a European future lies ahead. \\n I turn my attention to another issue that is of \\nconcern to international public opinion and whose \\npotential impact on peace and security is very \\nworrisome: the area of disarmament and nuclear \\nnon-proliferation. A few days ago, I had the \\nopportunity to state the views of the Luxembourg \\nGovernment at the General Conference of the \\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Here at \\nthe General Assembly I advocate once again for \\ncontinued efforts in the area of nuclear disarmament \\nand a strengthening of the non-proliferation regime, of \\nwhich the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons is and should remain the keystone. \\n I would also like to speak briefly about other \\ntypes of arms with destabilizing effects or unacceptable \\nconsequences for civilians; small arms and light \\nweapons and sub-munitions. I hope that significant \\nadvances may soon be made, on those two categories \\nof weapons in particular. The Luxembourg Government \\nfor its part intends to participate actively in this debate \\nand is currently preparing a bill forbidding the \\nmanufacture, storage, utilization and trade in weapons \\nemploying sub-munitions. \\n The quest for international disarmament and the \\nstrengthening of international regimes on weapons of \\nmass destruction consistently remain objectives of the \\nLuxembourg Government, because of the serious \\nconcern we feel as we observe certain current \\ndevelopments with regard to respect for existing \\ninternational norms, in particular with reference to the \\nIranian issue. \\n While the agreement that has just been concluded \\nbetween the secretariat of the International Atomic \\nEnergy Agency   specifically Mr. ElBaradei   and \\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran goes in the right direction, \\nwe note with concern that Iran has not yet taken the \\nnecessary measures to bring itself into conformity with \\nthe three relevant resolutions of the Security Council. I \\nappeal to Iran finally to take that action and to suspend \\nall activities linked to enrichment. \\n On the set of issues that I have just mentioned, \\nthe Charter has entrusted a central role to the Security \\nCouncil. It is essential for the Council to adapt to the \\npolitical realities of the beginning of the twenty-first \\ncentury by enlarging its membership in the categories \\nof permanent and non-permanent members, \\nguaranteeing an appropriate place for the small States \\nthat represent the vast majority of States Members of \\nthe Organization. It is important also to modernize the \\nCouncil’s functioning for the sake of enhanced \\neffectiveness and transparency, with broader \\ninvolvement for the entire membership. On the basis of \\nthe consensus decision that was adopted at the end of \\nthe sixty-first session of the General Assembly (see \\nA/61/PV.109), I venture to hope that significant \\nprogress will be achieved in the area of Security \\nCouncil reform in months to come. My country is \\neager to make its contribution to the achievement of \\nthe purposes of the Charter and to shoulder its share of \\nresponsibility in international peace and security, and \\nthus wishes to become   for the first time since it \\nplaced its signature on the San Francisco Charter in \\n1945   a non-permanent member of the Security \\nCouncil for 2013 and 2014. \\n Security Council reform is an important portion \\nof the United Nations reform agenda outlined at the \\n2005 Summit. If recourse to a multilateral machinery, \\nwith the United Nations at its core, is to be credible, \\nthen the tool made available to the international \\ncommunity must be commensurate with the \\ndevelopments of our time and capable of responding \\nadequately to the expectations of efficiency and \\neffectiveness harboured by States and peoples \\nworldwide. \\n The reform effort should be pursued and \\nsupported with conviction by a revitalized General \\nAssembly, exercising its prerogatives with energy and \\ndiscernment and achieving its priority objectives. \\nReform, and thus the modernization of multilateralism, \\ncan succeed only if it rests on the common will of all \\nMember States. \\n That applies in particular to the field of system-\\nwide coherence in operational activities. To overcome \\nthe fragmentation that has developed over more than \\n60 years of United Nations history, to restore to the \\nsystem and its actors a more effective capacity for \\naction, particularly at the level of the countries and \\npopulations concerned, and to strengthen operational \\ncoherence in the eight areas covered by the report of \\nthe High-level Panel (A/61/583) are primary objectives \\nfor the performance and thus the credibility of the \\nUnited Nations system. They are also decisions that \\nneed to be taken courageously and proactively in the \\nappropriate forums. \\n While the success of reform would be reflected in \\na win-win-win situation for donor countries, recipient \\ncountries and the United Nations as a whole, as \\nMr. Ban Ki-moon has rightly said, the failure of reform \\nwould be likely to marginalize the entire system over \\nthe long term. The choice is before us; we must \\nshoulder our political responsibilities. \\n More than ever, effective multilateralism is a \\ngreat hope of our populations aspiring to a more just, \\nmore peaceful and more prosperous world, where the \\ngreat ecological balance is preserved and where every \\nman and every woman can live in dignity and in full \\nenjoyment of his or her human rights. Let us not \\ndisappoint that expectation.  \\n And let us remember this very wise saying from \\nthe Roman philosopher Seneca: It is not because it is \\ndifficult that we do not dare to do it; it is because we \\ndo not dare to do it that it is difficult. \\n\", ' To all the  peoples represented here, I convey the brotherly \\ngreetings of France. Mr. Secretary-General, you have \\nan enormous responsibility, and you have the trust of \\nFrance. \\n This is the first time that I address this Assembly \\non behalf of France. It is a solemn and moving moment \\nfor me. I cannot help thinking of all of those men and \\nwomen who, at one of the most tragic moments in the \\nhistory of humanity, as the world stood on the brink of \\nbarbarity, finding that prospect intolerable, succeeded \\nin countering force and violence and barbarity with \\njustice and peace. Thus was the United Nations born. \\n The United Nations is not a mere political \\nconstruct. It is not a mere legal construct. It is an \\nawakening of the human conscience against everything \\nthat threatens to destroy humanity. \\n I have never believed that the United Nations \\ncould one day root out the violence that lies within \\nhuman beings. But what I do know deep down inside \\nme, what we all know deep down, is that in spite of all \\nits failures, without the United Nations it would have \\nbeen impossible to put an end to conflicts that seemed \\nto be insoluble. Remember the genocide of the \\nCambodian people, remember the suffering inflicted \\nupon them; remember the independence of Namibia; \\nremember the independence of Timor. Look at the \\nGreat Lakes region, or West Africa. Without the United \\nNations, the world might have experienced a third \\nworld war, doubtless even more terrible than the two \\nprevious ones. \\n France is convinced that the United Nations is the \\nonly remedy we have for the blindness and folly that \\nsometimes take hold of human beings. \\n The message I wish to bring to you in the name \\nof France is a simple one: in this world where the fate \\nof each of us depends on the fate of others, the United \\nNations should not be weakened; the United Nations \\nmust be strengthened. Reforming the United Nations so \\nas to adapt it to the realities of our world is an absolute \\npriority for France. We cannot afford to wait any \\nlonger. The world’s problems must be addressed and \\nresolved globally. No one on this Earth can alone \\nprotect themselves from the consequences of climate \\nwarming, the clash of civilizations, major epidemics. \\nAgainst selfishness, against fanaticism, against hatred, \\nit is our duty to renew that appeal to the universal \\nconscience by virtue of which, for the first time in the \\nhistory of all the peoples of the world, all nations \\nagreed to meet within a common forum in order to set \\naside what divides us and talk to one another. \\nThis appeal to the universal conscience is an \\nappeal for peace. It is an appeal for open-mindedness. \\nIt is an appeal for diversity. And it is an appeal for \\njustice. France has always sought greatness for the sake \\nof men and women, not for its own sake. Like all \\nnations, France, in the course of its long history, has \\nmade mistakes, and has sometimes been at fault. But \\nits people, the people of France, have always chosen to \\nbe on the side of freedom and democracy. France is \\nloyal to its friends and to the values it shares with \\nthem. But this loyalty is not submission. This loyalty is \\nnot a shackle. And France intends to draw on that \\nloyalty in the cause of openness to others, of openness \\nto the world. I want the world to know that France is \\nwilling to talk to everybody in the world, in every \\ncontinent. \\n But I would also like to say that openness is not \\nrenunciation. Understanding is not weakness. \\nWeakness and renunciation are not factors of peace; \\nthey are factors of war. France and Europe in the past \\nexperienced the tragic consequences of such an attitude \\nfor themselves and for the whole world. When you are \\nweak and submissive, you get ready to accept war. We \\nall have a duty to ensure that that never happens again. \\nThere will be no peace in the world if the international \\ncommunity compromises with the right of peoples to \\nself-determination and if it compromises with human \\nrights. \\n There will be no peace in the world unless the \\ninternational community is unshakeable in its \\ndetermination to fight terrorism. There will be no peace \\nin the world unless the international community stands \\nunited in its resolve to put an end to the wars in the \\nMiddle East, to put an end to the horror in Darfur, to \\nthe tragedy of Lebanon or to the humanitarian disaster \\nin Somalia. And I weigh my words carefully. There \\nwill be no peace in the world if the international \\ncommunity falters in the face of the proliferation of \\nnuclear weapons. \\n Iran is entitled to nuclear power for civilian \\npurposes. But if we allow Iran to acquire nuclear \\nweapons, there would be an unacceptable risk to \\nstability in the region and in the world. I want to say \\nhere, in the name of France, that we can only resolve \\nthis crisis by combining firmness with dialogue. It is in \\nthat spirit that France will act. \\n I want to say here, in the name of France, that it \\nis the duty of the international community to confront \\nthose who seek power and constantly threaten the \\nfragile balance of peace and to do so by bringing to \\nbear its unwavering unity and its determination to \\nuphold the law. I want to say, in the name of France, \\nthat there will be no peace in the world without respect \\nfor diversity, without respect for national identities, \\nwithout respect, I venture to say, for religions and \\nbeliefs, or without respect for cultures. Attachment to \\none’s faith, to one’s identity, to one’s language and \\nculture, and to one’s way of life, thought and belief   \\nall that is legitimate, and profoundly human. To deny \\nthat is to sow the seeds of humiliation. It would stoke \\nthe fires of nationalism, fanaticism and terrorism. We \\nwill not avert the clash of civilizations by forcing \\neveryone to think and to believe the same things. \\nFrance intends to pursue, together with all people of \\ngoodwill, this battle to build a new world order of the \\ntwenty-first century. \\n We want a Lebanon living independently, and we \\nsay that France will always stand shoulder to shoulder \\nwith Lebanon in its desire for independence. Tomorrow \\nwe hope that Israelis and Palestinians will find within \\nthemselves the strength to live in peace. Peace is \\npossible. It is possible now. And we will devote all of \\nour energies to that. \\n We want to see the peaceful coexistence of the \\nmain religions to vanquish fundamentalism and \\nfanaticism. But I want to say, with all due gravity, that \\nthere is too much injustice in the world for the world to \\nhope to live in peace. \\n The founding fathers of the United Nations knew \\nthat the world’s future could be read in the eyes of a \\ntortured child; a hungry child; children who watch their \\nparents being humiliated; children who since birth have \\nknown nothing but war; children torn from their \\nhomes, their lands, their families. Because in those \\nchildren’s desperate eyes there is not only suffering, \\nbut also all the wars and revolts that will drench the \\nworld in blood tomorrow. \\n Let us look at the world as it is. Let us look at \\nwhat we have made of it. Have we wanted enough to \\nmake it more just? The answer is no. Have we done \\nenough to achieve that end? The answer is no.  \\n When the Berlin wall fell, we all dreamed that \\nhistory would cease to be tragic. Let us look at our \\nworld as it is so that we can make it better. Let us \\njudge our world by the yardstick of justice. Justice \\nmeans that the Palestinian people can regain a country \\nand build a State. Justice means that the Israeli people \\ncan enjoy the right to live in security. Justice means \\nthat the Lebanese people can regain their freedom. \\nJustice means that the Iraqi people, in all their \\ndiversity, can find within themselves the path to \\nreconciliation and democracy. Justice means that a \\ndeveloping country on which we wish to impose \\nenvironmental rules, even though its inhabitants have \\nbarely enough to eat, can be helped to put such rules in \\nplace. Justice means that we cannot tap a country’s \\nresources without paying a fair price for them. \\n Let us look squarely at our world. Never before \\nhas there been so much easy money, with so much \\nwealth concentrated in the hands of a few large groups. \\nThroughout the world, even in the richest countries, \\nthere are many men and women who no longer have \\neven a hope of emerging some day from their material \\nand moral distress.  \\n In conclusion, I appeal to the conscience of all \\nthose who have a responsibility for the conduct of \\nworld affairs. Because if we do nothing, the poor and \\nthe exploited will one day rise up against the injustice \\ndone to them. \\n What the world needs is a new mindset: a \\ngenuine New Deal on a global scale, an ecological and \\neconomic New Deal. On behalf of France, I call on all \\nStates to join together to found the new world order of \\nthe twenty-first century, predicated on the key idea that \\nthe common goods of humanity must be the \\nresponsibility of all of humanity.  \\n On behalf of France, I solemnly appeal to the \\nUnited Nations to provide itself, in this era marked by \\nthe return of scarcity, with the means to guarantee that \\nall people throughout the world have access to vital \\nresources: water, energy, food, medicine and \\nknowledge. I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to \\nconcern itself with the issue of fairer distribution of \\nwealth and of the income derived from commodities \\nand technology. I solemnly appeal to the United \\nNations to concern itself with the moralization of \\nfinancial capitalism. I solemnly appeal to the United \\nNations to go further in combating corruption, which \\nsaps countries that are suffering and all too poor. \\n Things must change. Mindsets must change. \\nBehaviour must change. This is our responsibility now, \\nbecause tomorrow it will be too late. If we fail to act, \\nwe will see a resurgence of all the threats that the \\npeople of the post-war world believed they had \\novercome. Let us not take this risk lightly.  \\n Peoples of the world, we can, together, build a \\nbetter future for all people. It is up to us alone; it is up \\nto our capacity to remain faithful to the values that \\nhave brought us together here today. You have \\nunderstood. France believes that we have no more time \\nto wait. France calls for action. France urges action. \\nFrance is committed to action in the service of world \\npeace. \\n', 'We \\nlive in an increasingly complex world of ever more \\ndiverse challenges. Actions taken in isolation are no \\nlonger enough. Given such complexity, the United \\nNations should not only be a bulwark against arbitrary \\nactions in international relations but also, above all, the \\nvehicle for effective responses. I am pleased to note \\nthat there is growing consensus on this issue. \\n Climate change was the topic of a recent high-\\nlevel event. A Security Council summit meeting has \\njust addressed the situation in Africa. In addition to \\npeace and international security, the United Nations \\nmust also tackle a wide array of issues. The fight \\nagainst terrorism, pandemics, human rights, \\ndisarmament, migration and the environment are \\nexamples of the diverse subjects requiring a \\nmultilateral approach. \\n Multilateralism has been reinvigorated, especially \\nin the areas of peacekeeping and security. The current \\n18 peacekeeping missions and the 100,000 Blue \\nHelmets now in the field clearly attest to that. Belgium \\nhas witnessed that evolution up close since becoming a \\nmember of the Security Council at the beginning of \\n2007. We shall continue to strengthen multilateralism \\nin that body. \\n In Africa, working through the United Nations, \\nthe international community has been actively engaged \\nin the search for solutions to the issues of Darfur, \\nChad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic \\nRepublic of Congo and Côte d’Ivoire. \\n The efforts of the United Nations Organization \\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \\n(MONUC) have been crucial to re-establishing peace \\nand setting up democratic institutions in that country. \\nNow is not the time to scale back our efforts. The \\ntenuous situation in the eastern part of the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo and the resumption of fighting \\nin North Kivu pose serious risks to the process of \\nstabilizing the country. They also have tragic \\nhumanitarian consequences. Moreover, the scourge of \\nthe recruitment of child soldiers takes on new \\nproportions. As pointed out by the Secretary-General, \\nwe urgently need a global solution, including a \\nregional dimension that will allow us to make better \\nuse of MONUC’s input. While the Congolese \\nauthorities are preparing for local elections, which will \\nstrengthen democratic culture across the country, they \\nneed our full support. Belgium will continue to \\nmobilize the attention of the international community \\non this important matter. \\n In Sudan, it is imperative that we make progress \\nin our search for a political solution for Darfur. I \\nencourage all parties to take advantage of the Tripoli \\nconference in order to identify the elements of the \\nconflict, such as the distribution of resources and \\npower-sharing, and to establish the foundation for a \\nlasting settlement. We need to speed up the deployment \\nof the peacekeeping force, with the full cooperation of \\nthe Sudanese Government. Moreover, we will have to \\ncontinue to consolidate reconciliation between north \\nand south of the country. \\n Furthermore, the role of regional organizations in \\nmanaging crises has significantly increased over the \\npast year. The African Union has invested its efforts, \\nboth in Somalia and in Darfur, where new ways of \\ncooperation with the United Nations are developing. \\nThe hybrid force is an example of this new form of \\ncooperation.  \\n As for the European Union, it has supported \\nMONUC’s efforts in the Democratic Republic of the \\nCongo. It will also contribute to curbing the \\nhumanitarian crisis in Chad and in the Central African \\nRepublic by sending a military force to support the \\nUnited Nations missions in the region. Belgium will \\nparticipate in this effort. The European Union has also \\ndeveloped a close cooperation with the African Union \\nby supporting its efforts in crisis management, while \\npaying close attention to the strengthening of its \\neffectiveness. On the whole, we welcome this regional \\ninput and the increasing synergies among the United \\nNations, the African Union and the European Union. \\n Regarding Kosovo, it is, on the other hand, \\nregrettable that the Security Council was unable last \\nJune to assume its responsibility on a matter for which \\nthe solution is essential for peace and stability in \\nEurope. I urge both parties to seize this present \\nopportunity to come to a compromise. This is a matter \\nof urgency. The status quo is not an option, as we are \\nall aware. Absent an agreement between the parties, \\nEurope will then have to shoulder its responsibilities. \\n In the Middle East, the international community \\nhas mobilized in order to contribute to a solution to the \\ncrisis in Lebanon. By extending for one year the \\nmandate of the United Nations Interim Force in \\nLebanon (UNIFIL), in which Belgium participates with \\nclose to 400 troops, it has recognized UNIFIL’s role in \\nthe solution of the crisis.  \\n But the current political stalemate is alarming. All \\nparties should demonstrate a sense of responsibility. \\nThe institutions should be allowed to function normally \\nagain, beginning with the election of the president in \\naccordance with the constitutional process, in the \\nassigned timetable and without foreign interference. \\nThe latest attack that claimed the lives of member of \\nParliament Antoine Ghanem and nine other people \\nshows how impunity threatens the stability of the \\ncountry. The establishment of the Special Tribunal for \\nLebanon is clear evidence of the support that the \\nmultilateral system is willing to provide to the fight \\nagainst this impunity. \\n In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, neither the \\ncontinuation of firing rockets at the Israeli population, \\nnor the deterioration of the living conditions of \\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip, is acceptable. Regular \\nmeetings between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders \\nconstitute an encouraging development after so many \\nyears of misunderstanding and lack of true dialogue. I \\nhope that these steps will be bear fruit at the \\ninternational meeting slated for before the end of this \\nyear. Belgium actively supports any progress in the \\npeace process. \\n The Security Council has recently reinforced the \\nmandate of the United Nations in Iraq. The United \\nNations can, in fact, play an important role in \\nhumanitarian emergency matters, in regional \\ncooperation and in national reconciliation. But its \\naction will depend on the security conditions and will \\nhave to be able to rely truly on the support of the \\ninternational community, the Iraqi Government and the \\nneighbouring countries, as expressed at the \\n22 September meeting. \\n In dealing with the nuclear issue in Iran, Belgium \\nhas, from the outset, supported a multilateral approach. \\nWe have to resolutely use the multilateral mechanisms \\nsuch as the International Atomic Energy Agency \\n(IAEA) and the Security Council, in order to obtain \\ntangible results. In the past, Iran has not fulfilled its \\nobligations regarding the transparency of its nuclear \\nactivities. In order to restore confidence and to make \\nthe best use of the objective verification capacities of \\nthe IAEA, Iran will have to fully respect the \\nregulations of the Comprehensive Safeguards \\nAgreement and the Additional Protocol. However, the \\nmeasures prescribed in Security Council resolutions go \\nbeyond those regulations and aim at creating the \\nconditions for restoring international confidence in the \\nIranian nuclear programme. Complete and immediate \\ncompliance with these resolutions by Iran is a \\ncondition to resume the dialogue that had to be \\ninterrupted in 2005. The credibility of the Security \\nCouncil is also at stake. \\n In Asia, the mission of good offices of the \\nSecretary-General has made it possible for us to follow \\nclosely the situation in Myanmar. The latest \\ndemonstrations show the determination of the \\npopulation and should finally incite the Government to \\ninitiate an inclusive dialogue with a view to restoring \\ndemocracy in Myanmar. Use of violence will not be \\ntolerated. \\n Beyond crisis resolution, progress has also been \\nmade in the area of peacebuilding. The international \\ncommunity must remain vigilant. The cost of leaving a \\ncountry too quickly is always higher than investing in \\npeacebuilding. The true success of the Peacebuilding \\nCommission will be judged by the long-term stability \\nof the countries currently on its agenda, namely, \\nBurundi and Sierra Leone. \\n The recent adoption of concrete recommendations \\nfollowing the deterioration of the political situation in \\nBurundi illustrates its increasing capacity to react \\nquickly to events that could jeopardize the stabilization \\nof the countries with which it is dealing. In Burundi, \\nthe dialogue must definitely be pursued in order to \\nsolve the political stalemate, which impedes the normal \\nfunctioning of the State’s institutions. Every effort \\nmust be made in order to bring the Forces nationales de \\nlibération (FNL) back to constructive negotiations with \\nthe Government as soon as possible. \\n Three of the most recent and expensive \\npeacekeeping operations have been deployed in \\ncountries where conflicts were fuelled by the illegal \\nexploitation of natural resources, namely, the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra \\nLeone. That clearly illustrates the urgent need to \\ndevelop mechanisms that break the link between the \\nillegal exploitation of natural resources and conflict.  \\n This issue was the central theme of our \\npresidency of the Security Council last June. We \\nidentified several courses of action. For example, we \\nmust reinforce the capacity of the Secretariat to deal \\nwith such issues; define more precisely, as necessary, \\nthe mandates of peacekeeping operations; cause the \\nsanctions committees to operate in a more targeted \\nmanner; and consolidate the methods of the work of \\nexperts groups. In the coming months, it is our \\nintention to pursue our efforts in these areas, which \\nrelate to both security and development. We hope that \\nwe can rely on the support of Member States. \\nOur attention to crisis management and \\npeacebuilding must not diminish the importance that \\nwe accord to preventive diplomacy. I welcome the \\ninitiatives of the Secretary-General in this area, such as \\nstrengthening United Nations mediation capacities and \\nupgrading the mandates concerning prevention of \\ngenocide and mass atrocities and concerning \\nresponsibility to protect. We also have to make this \\nconcept operational. \\n Conflict affects civilian populations long after the \\nend of hostilities. The prevention of conflict should not \\noverlook human security. That is why our country is \\nworking to promote an international instrument on \\ncluster bombs; that is why it supports negotiations on a \\ntreaty on arms trafficking, and that is also why we are \\npursuing action against the recruitment and use of child \\nsoldiers. \\n Crisis prevention also entails development. \\nEveryone should have the opportunity to choose his or \\nher way in life with dignity. The alternative is \\nfrustration that often leads only to violence. The \\nMillennium Development Goals and the fight against \\npoverty therefore remain a major challenge.  \\n In this context, Belgium pays special attention to \\ngood governance. Last March, in cooperation with the \\nWorld Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-\\noperation and Development, we organized in Brussels \\nan international conference on good governance and \\nthe fight against corruption. That conference illustrated \\nthe potential in this area — triangular partnerships \\namong donor countries, recipient countries and the \\nprivate sector — which needs to be explored, including \\nwithin the United Nations. \\n Poverty also forces many migrants to leave their \\ncountry, having no other choice. In July 2007, Belgium \\norganized, in the presence of the Secretary-General, the \\nfirst Global Forum on Migration and Development. \\nThat was a new opportunity to demonstrate our firm \\nmultilateral commitment. It emerged that legal \\nmigration can be an opportunity for both the countries \\nof origin and the countries of destination. In addition, \\nwith good cooperation between the countries involved, \\ndevelopment can also foster migration by choice rather \\nthan by necessity. Belgium will contribute to the \\nfollow-up of this initiative with the Philippines, which \\nwill organize the second Global Forum in 2008. \\n Human rights are one of the pillars of our \\ncollective security. We must ensure respect for those \\nrights under all circumstances. That is why in 2005 we \\nemphasized the need for in-depth reform of the former \\nCommission on Human Rights. At this stage, however, \\nI regretfully note that the new Human Rights Council \\ndoes not meet our expectations. An institutional \\nagreement that was reached between the members of \\nthe Human Rights Council in Geneva in June came at \\nthe expense of difficult concessions. The capacity of \\nthe Council to react promptly to human rights \\nviolations will thus be compromised. \\n Multilateralism is back. Nevertheless, it is only a \\nmethod, not an end in itself, and this method can be \\ndisappointing if it does not bring results. We therefore \\nneed an instrument that will animate multilateralism \\nand adapt the United Nations to the current \\nenvironment. Achieving our common objectives \\ndepends on developing a modern organization that is \\nwell adapted, well equipped and well managed. We \\nwill therefore need to consolidate the bases for a \\nresponsible and professional Secretariat. \\n System-wide coherence in the United Nations is \\nalso indispensable from this standpoint. In order to \\nfoster coherence of development activities by the \\nUnited Nations in the field, the current reform effort \\nhas as its main objective to reinforce its efficiency for \\nthe benefit of developing countries. \\n After years of discussion, it is unfortunate that we \\nhave not been able to make progress on the \\nindispensable reform of the Security Council. We \\nundoubtedly need a new working method that would \\nallow us to get the technical working group out of New \\nYork, where it is bogged down, and to involve the \\ncapitals and the political levels more. I therefore \\nsuggest appointing a high-level special envoy for \\nSecurity Council reform, who would be responsible for \\nleading these consultations and for presenting us with a \\nproposal. \\n As far as I am concerned, my clear preference \\ngoes to a formula that would consist initially of an \\naddition of new, semi-permanent seats, without \\nmodifying the current balance between permanent and \\nnon-permanent members. Later on, permanent \\nmembers would accept to give up their right of veto. \\n The United Nations must serve the general \\ninterest of the community of Member States, as well as \\nof the populations they represent. The United Nations \\nwill succeed only if those States manage to transcend \\nthe sum of their particular interests. It is the shared \\nresponsibility of each of us to display the necessary \\nvision in order to put our Organization in the service of \\nthe common good. \\n', 'I bring \\nyou fraternal greetings from Europe — Europe that is \\nconscious of its responsibilities and wishes to act; \\nEurope that is true to its values — democracy and \\nfreedom; Europe that is loyal to its friends, but also \\nEurope that wishes to speak to the whole world in \\nservice of dialogue and of peace. \\n At a time when the world is deeply troubled, I \\nhave come to tell you, on behalf of Europe, that in the \\nmidst of so many difficulties the international \\ncommunity has a political and moral responsibility that \\nwe must shoulder. Let us not forget that if we are \\ngathered here today, it is because following one of the \\nmost terrible tragedies that humankind has ever known, \\nthere were men and women of good will who were \\ndetermined that in the future no one could ever say, \\nwhen faced with misfortune: “There is nothing we can \\n \\n \\n13 08-51570 \\n \\ndo.” That is why we are here, because those who went \\nbefore us did not renounce their responsibility. Europe \\nbelieves that today, our duty is to act and to refuse to \\nsubmit.  \\n We can wait no longer. We are beginning to \\ngauge the tragic consequences of having already \\nwaited too long. We cannot wait to achieve peace, to \\nend the tragedy in Darfur. We cannot wait to fight \\nterrorism, to avert the food crisis that condemns so \\nmany human beings to die of hunger. We cannot wait \\nto prepare for the post-petroleum world, to fight global \\nwarming, to save the oceans, to put an end to monetary, \\nsocial and ecological dumping. We cannot wait to bring \\nethics to financial capitalism.  \\n For too long we have all been resigned to being \\npowerless. For too long we have retreated before the \\nneed to give to the globalized world institutions that \\nwill enable it to be regulated. \\n The world of the twenty-first century cannot be \\ngoverned with the institutions of the twentieth century. \\nWe are a century behind. Let today’s major Powers and \\nthe Powers of tomorrow unite to shoulder together the \\nresponsibilities their influence gives them in world \\naffairs.  \\n To all those who are hesitant, I wish to say that \\nenlarging the Security Council and the G-8 is not just a \\nmatter of fairness, it is also a question of effectiveness. \\nWe can no longer wait to turn the G-8 into the G14 and \\nto bring in China, India, South Africa, Mexico and \\nBrazil. Italy is proposing a major step in that direction \\nat the next summit, which it will host, and Italy is \\nright. \\n Let us act to make our international institutions \\nmore representative, because if they are more \\nrepresentative they will be stronger, more effective and \\nmore respected. A new world is emerging not only \\nthrough all our successes, but also through all the \\ncrises besetting the planet. However, we cannot receive \\nthat new world passively, we must build it. \\n Let us learn to manage together the most acute \\ncrises that no one, not even the most powerful among \\nus, can resolve alone. I am convinced that it is the duty \\nof the heads of State and Government of the countries \\nmost directly concerned to meet before the end of the \\nyear to examine together the lessons of the most \\nserious financial crisis the world has experienced since \\nthat of the 1930s. Who would understand it if the \\nworld’s major economies should fail to take the time to \\nmeet to discuss what we must do together and the \\nlessons we must draw from what has happened? \\n Let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism, in \\nwhich entire swathes of financial activity are not left to \\nthe sole judgement of market operators; in which banks \\ndo their job; which is to finance economic development \\nrather than to fuel speculation; in which rules of \\nprudence apply to all and serve to avert and soften \\nshocks instead of exacerbating them; in which the \\ncredit agencies are controlled and punished when \\nnecessary; in which transparency of transactions \\nreplaces such opacity that today it is difficult to \\nunderstand what is happening; and in which modes of \\nremuneration do not drive people to take unreasonable \\nrisks. It is my duty to say that those who jeopardize \\npeople’s savings should be punished and at last face up \\nto their responsibilities. We will succeed in that on the \\ncondition that we work together. \\n In our globalized world, the fate of each is linked \\nto that of all others. The negotiations on climate \\nchange, begun in Bali, will conclude in Copenhagen \\nnext year. Whatever our particular interests, we do not \\nhave the right to fail. \\n Europe will adopt an unprecedented raft of \\nmeasures on energy and climate in December. Europe \\ndoes not wish to teach lessons; it wishes to set an \\nexample. Europe also wishes to set the example by \\nacting to bring about peace. It did so in Georgia. It did \\nso with the Union for the Mediterranean. Because for \\nover half a century Europe has undertaken to stop the \\nendless cycle of war, vengeance and hate that has \\nperiodically taken it to the edge of the precipice, it \\ndoes not want war. It does not want a war of \\ncivilizations. It does not want a war of religion. It does \\nnot want a cold war.  \\n Europe wants peace, and because it wants peace \\nit says to Russia that it wants links of solidarity with \\nthat country, that it wants to build a shared future, and \\nthat it wants to be Russia’s partner. Why not build a \\ncontinent-wide common economic space that would \\nunite Russia and Europe? However, Europe also says \\nto Russia with the same sincerity that it cannot \\ncompromise on the principle of the sovereignty and \\nindependence of States, their territorial integrity or \\nrespect for international law. Europe’s message to all \\nStates is that it cannot accept the use of force to settle a \\ndispute. \\n  \\n \\n08-51570 14 \\n \\n Europe says to Iran that it respects that country, \\nthat Iran has the right to civil nuclear energy and that it \\nwill explore all avenues of dialogue. However, it says \\nto Iran with the same sincerity that it cannot accept a \\nnuclear-armed Iran that would endanger the peace and \\nstability of the whole region. Nor can Europe \\ntolerate — and I say this solemnly — Iran calling for \\nthe destruction of the State of Israel. \\n Europe says to Israel that it is its friend and that it \\nwill let no one threaten its existence. Europe says to \\nIsrael that it will always be at its side in the fight \\nagainst terrorism, but with the same sincerity says to \\ntelling Israel that there will be no peace until there is a \\nviable Palestinian State with recognized borders. \\n Europe says to Afghanistan that it will continue \\nto stand by it and that it will not permit barbarians \\nallied with Al-Qaida again to take an entire people \\nhostage and to turn an entire country into a terrorist \\nbase.  \\n Europe says to Somalia that it will help it, with \\nthe support of the United Nations, to combat the \\nscourge of piracy off its coasts. Until all States join \\ntogether to establish a maritime police force, we cannot \\nallow some hundreds of pirates to threaten the free \\npassage of ships throughout the world. \\n Europe says to Africa that it is committed to \\nco-development, that it wishes to be Africa’s privileged \\npartner, and that it has a common destiny with Africa \\nand a profound sense of solidarity. Europe says to \\nAfrica that it has its place among the permanent \\nmembers of the Security Council and in the enlarged \\nG-8. How can one ever hope to settle the great issues \\nof the world while ignoring Africa, South America or a \\nlarge part of Asia? Europe believes in the African \\nrenaissance, which is under way and, first and \\nforemost, is in the hands of the Africans, particularly \\nthose of African youth, which is the youth of the world. \\n Essentially, what brings us here together in this \\nforum, where everyone must listen to the others and \\nthereby show them a form of respect, is something \\nmore basic even than democracy. What brings us \\ntogether is respect for the dignity of all just as they are, \\nand for diversity of their opinions, cultures and beliefs. \\nHuman dignity is a universal value. What we must \\npromote everywhere is respect for that diversity, which \\nis the surest guarantor of peace and human fraternity \\nand the surest antidote to intolerance, hatred, violence, \\nobscurantism and fanaticism. \\n That is what Europe wants: peoples united in \\nrespect, understanding and solidarity; peoples united \\nthroughout the world working together for the great \\ncommon cause of safeguarding of humanity. Time is at \\na premium; the world cannot wait. ', 'Belgium echoes the congratulations that have been \\nextended to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his \\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \\nsixty-third session, and wishes him every success. \\n During the past year, the international community \\nhas faced unprecedented challenges. As we gather here \\nin New York, a major crisis of confidence is shaking \\nthe financial markets. This has an impact, of course, on \\nthe world economy. The spectre of a global recession \\nhas been added to the already onerous challenges that \\nhave arisen in recent times, such as the food crisis, the \\n A/63/PV.13\\n \\n15 08-53122 \\n \\nspike in energy prices, global warming, terrorism and \\nthe danger of nuclear proliferation. \\n In addition, our world is changing and becoming \\nincreasingly multipolar. In that regard, 8 August 2008 \\nwill remain symbolic: the very day on which China \\noffered us the unique spectacle of the opening of the \\nOlympic Games, Russia and Georgia were colliding in \\na conflict with harmful repercussions for peace on the \\nEuropean continent. The very foundations of the \\nbalance that had existed since the 1990s seemed to be \\ncalled into question. This uncertain situation has far-\\nreaching consequences for international organizations. \\n We could imagine that, in the face of these \\nenormous challenges, all the world’s countries would \\ncome together to combat them jointly. Unfortunately, \\nthat is hardly what is happening. Belgium believes that \\nonly through close cooperation and enhanced \\nmultilateralism will we be able to respond to these \\nchallenges. More than ever, whether we like it or not, \\nwe are in a situation of mutual dependence. Crises \\naffect all of us, and the actions taken by some have an \\nimpact on everybody else. That is particularly true for \\nthe current serious financial crisis. If we can stabilize \\nthe financial markets in the coming few days through \\nproactive measures, that will benefit not only the major \\nbanks and their employees, but also the entrepreneurs, \\nconsumers and citizens of the whole world, including \\nthose in the least developed countries. Those countries \\nhave already been heavily affected by the sharp \\nincrease in the prices of agricultural and energy \\nproducts and are the least equipped to deal with a \\ntightening of credit conditions.  \\n Stabilizing the markets is certainly necessary, but \\nit must not make us lose sight of the lessons to be \\nlearned from the crisis and the corresponding medium- \\nand long-term measures to be taken to ensure that the \\nworld does not again become victim to financial \\nmanagement that at times is risky and immense \\nspeculation with borrowed money.  \\n We are well aware that the crisis goes far beyond \\nthe capacity of a single country, however powerful it \\nmay be. Better regulation of financial markets and the \\ndrawing up of control regulations are essential, in \\nparticular with regard to short selling, hedge funds and \\nstructured products. That is a task that can be \\nundertaken only at the international level, in close \\ncooperation among the world’s economies. \\n Understand what I am saying: Belgium is \\nconvinced of the advantages of globalization and free \\ntrade. We must not forget that thanks to that \\nglobalization of trade, in recent decades the world has \\nseen remarkable development and that hundreds of \\nmillions of men and women have escaped extreme \\npoverty and today have a better daily life, even if the \\nsharing of wealth still remains too unequal. \\n The developed countries have the duty to \\nspearhead a better organization of the financial world. \\nThe European Union has already taken steps in that \\ndirection, and we welcome that. However, there \\nremains much to do. Here, I make an appeal that we \\nembark on that task together, with energy and \\ndedication. \\n The emergence of new economies is an asset for \\nthe world. Ever more countries are determined to \\nbecome players in the international system. They must \\ntake their due place, as the French President \\nemphasized last Monday on behalf of the European \\nUnion (see A/63/PV.5). It is also in everyone’s interest \\nto demonstrate responsibility. \\n I would like to stress today that the emerging \\neconomic Powers, from Brazil to India and from China \\nto South Africa, have, more than we do and more than \\never, a need for trade that is both open and fair to \\ncontinue to develop their economies at the pace they \\ndeserve, without however causing imbalance in the \\npillars of international trade. Here too, we must again \\nfind the constructive political will necessary to restart \\nthe Doha trade negotiations that unfortunately failed in \\nGeneva last July. \\n We all must also show ourselves to be responsible \\nplayers, in order to try and find solutions to the \\nchallenges posed by the food crisis and the huge \\nincrease in energy prices and to combat the causes and \\neffects of climate change. Those challenges we face, \\nissues that are extremely complex and closely \\ninterlinked, are different facets of one and the same \\nquestion, a question that is at the heart of the concerns \\nof my country: that of sustainable development. None \\nof us can resolve these problems alone. They call for \\nsolutions at the world level. It is thus crucial that we \\nsuccessfully conclude in December 2009 the \\nnegotiations for a global agreement on climate, as we \\npledged in Bali.  \\n Nor is it by closing in upon ourselves that we \\nshall reduce the huge inequalities that still characterize \\nA/63/PV.13  \\n \\n08-53122 16 \\n \\nglobal development. Better distribution of the fruits of \\neconomic growth is a world responsibility that \\nconcerns us all. The Millennium Development Goals \\nmust remain our main guiding principle. The Follow-\\nup International Conference on Financing for \\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \\nMonterrey Consensus, which will take place in Doha at \\nthe end of this year, will be an important moment. The \\ndeveloped countries must do more, and I reiterate \\nBelgium’s determination to achieve the objective of \\ndevoting 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product to \\nofficial development assistance by 2010.  \\n However, this is a shared responsibility, which \\nfirst and foremost falls to the Governments of the \\ncountries involved. That is why Belgium will continue \\nto work actively in promoting the concept of good \\ngovernance. \\n In that regard, the issue of natural resources is \\nparticularly important to me. It is not a matter of \\ncalling into question the sovereignty of any country. \\nBut sovereignty also carries with it responsibilities — \\nindeed, responsibilities first and foremost. Natural \\nresources may be a driving force of development to \\ndraw populations out of poverty if their exploitation is \\nundertaken in a transparent way to benefit the economy \\nof the country. Unfortunately, experience shows that \\nfrequently that is not the case and that illegal \\nexploitation often fuels conflict. Therefore, we must \\nwork towards achieving greater transparency and \\nfighting illegal exploitation. That is why Belgium \\norganized last year a debate on that subject in the \\nSecurity Council (see S/PV.5705), and why it would \\nlike extensive debate on natural resources during the \\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. \\n As a member of the Security Council, Belgium \\nhas had the opportunity to be at the heart of the \\ninternational system. That has bolstered our conviction \\nthat we can meet those great challenges only through \\nincreased international cooperation and has further \\nstrengthened our determination to work for effective \\nmultilateralism. The key to that effectiveness is not to \\nbe sought only in structures and mechanisms. It lies \\nalso and above all in our political will to make them \\nwork and together to find solutions to our common \\nproblems. \\n Here, I note with regret a certain turning inwards, \\neven a return to sovereignty-based concerns. I want to \\nbe clear: I have great respect for the sovereignty of \\nStates. That goes without saying. That is one of the \\nfundamental principles upon which our international \\nsystem is founded. However, being a sovereign State \\nalso means that a State must shoulder its \\nresponsibilities in the international community, even \\nmore so with regard to its own population. Being a \\nsovereign State does not mean that it can neglect the \\nneeds of its citizens in terms of development, security, \\nthe rule of law and human rights. Sovereignty does not \\ngive carte blanche for conduct that is incompatible \\nwith the values and commitments to which we have \\nsubscribed within the United Nations. Sovereignty \\nmust be a force for good, and not an excuse for a State \\nnot to meet its responsibilities and to avoid its \\ninternational and humanitarian obligations. Otherwise, \\nit becomes what I would call souverainism: an abuse of \\nsovereignty behind which to hide and escape its duties. \\n Too often the argument of respect for sovereignty \\nprevents the international community from acting when \\nthe situation in a country is deteriorating before our \\neyes, resulting in the population suffering and an \\nincrease in serious human rights violations. The \\nexamples are well known and strike us all. Myanmar, \\nDarfur, Zimbabwe and the eastern Congo all confront \\nus with a responsibility to protect, a responsibility that \\nthe international community is called upon to exercise \\nwhen a sovereign State cannot or, worse, refuses to \\nassume that responsibility. That can be undertaken \\nthrough humanitarian instruments, the civil \\nadministration of crises, peacekeeping or peace-\\nrestoration missions, or, earlier on, crisis prevention. \\n In that context, I wish to speak of combating \\nimpunity. Belgium is convinced that there cannot be \\nlasting peace without justice. That principle guides our \\nforeign policy. It is achieved in the first place by \\nbolstering the rule of law and justice at the national \\nlevel before, during and after a conflict. For the gravest \\ncrimes, we actively support the development of \\ninternational criminal law. This is not the time to let \\nany doubts persist with regard to our active support for \\nthe International Criminal Court by putting forward, as \\nsome do, other, more regional solutions. That is \\nparticularly true now when the Court is preparing its \\nfirst trial. \\n Peace and security are the responsibility of the \\ninternational community as a whole, and it is in that \\nspirit that Belgium approached its mandate in the \\nSecurity Council, nearly two years ago: seek \\nconstantly, in a constructive and non-dogmatic manner, \\n A/63/PV.13\\n \\n17 08-53122 \\n \\nthe best way to move things forward. It is particularly \\npleased with the progress in crisis management and the \\nextraordinary expansion of peacekeeping operations. \\nFrom that perspective Belgium calls for a renewal of \\nthe United Nations Organization Mission in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo with a strengthened \\nmandate, which is a key factor in maintaining in the \\neastern Congo the prospects for settling the crisis and \\navoiding a Somalian scenario.  \\n Belgium also welcomes efforts of regional \\norganizations and their collaboration with the United \\nNations. I am thinking, for instance, of the European \\nUnion alongside the United Nations in Chad and the \\nCentral African Republic.  \\n We need to make further progress with regard to \\nan integrated and comprehensive approach to conflict \\nresolution. The establishment of the Peacebuilding \\nCommission is a real step forward in that area. That is \\nwhy Belgium has assumed the chair of the country-\\nspecific configuration on the Central African Republic. \\nMajor progress has been made, but much remains to be \\ndone, in particular in order to better help countries \\nduring that delicate phase when they are emerging \\nfrom crisis. \\n We will soon celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That will \\nbe the time for us to remember the values that it \\nrepresents and that we all share, and to which we all \\nsubscribed and which we should implement for the \\nbenefit of our citizens and for greater well-being \\nthroughout the world. It is a responsibility that we must \\nremember, particularly since it seems to be called into \\nquestion at a time when we are faced with the major \\nchallenges that I have just described. Together and on \\nthe basis of our shared values, we should assume those \\nresponsibilities. \\n That is the real challenge. It is not through less, \\nbut more international cooperation and multilateralism \\nthat we will achieve solutions. ', '“[We] will not enjoy development without security, we \\nwill not enjoy security without development, and we \\nwill not enjoy either without respect for human rights” \\n(A/59/2005, para. 17). In this year when we celebrate \\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \\nHuman Rights, that fundamental observation by former \\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan continues to be as \\nrelevant as ever, and it must continue to guide our \\nactions and those of our Organization and our \\nGovernments. \\n I should like briefly to recall the two high-level \\nevents that we have attended in the past few days: that \\non Africa’s development needs and that on the \\nMillennium Development Goals. Those meetings \\nshowed that some progress has been made — and there \\nhas been unquestionable progress that must be \\nacknowledged: for example, we have seen a drop of \\n400 million in the number of people living in extreme \\npoverty, a drop of 27 per cent in the mortality rate of \\nchildren under the age of five, increased investments in \\neducation and health and progress regarding gender \\nequality. But they also emphasized the absolute need to \\nstrengthen our efforts if we want to achieve the goals \\nthat we set ourselves by consensus in 2000, all the \\nmore since the rise in food and fuel prices and the \\nslowing of the world economy that we have seen in \\nrecent months threaten our achievements. \\n \\n \\n41 08-52265 \\n \\n Luxembourg has resolutely focussed its \\ncooperation policy on the eradication of poverty, \\nparticularly in the least developed countries. Its actions \\nare conceived in the spirit of sustainable development, \\nincluding its social, economic and environmental \\naspects, with men, women and children at their core. \\nToday, my country spends 0.92 per cent of its gross \\nnational income on official development assistance, \\nand we expect to continue on that track in order to \\nachieve the goal of 1 per cent in the coming years. \\nTogether with others, we shall invest our efforts to \\nensure that the commitments entered into 2005 at the \\nEuropean level are fully respected at the Doha \\nConference on Financing for Development.  \\n While establishing a true development \\npartnership must be based on shared responsibilities by \\ndonor and recipient countries, and while we are \\ncounting on strengthened action by developing \\ncountries with regard to good governance, the rule of \\nlaw, capacity-building and ownership of their own \\ndevelopment, respect by developed countries of their \\ncommitments regarding the quality and quantity of \\nassistance is an important basis for such a partnership, \\nparticularly with respect to Africa. Nevertheless, I \\nwould like to recall that the European Union and its \\nmember States account for 55 to 60 per cent of global \\nworldwide development assistance. \\n I would not like to omit a subject that was at the \\ncentre of our discussions last year and that has a major \\nimpact on the potential of countries’ development: \\nclimate change. It is essential to continue along the \\ncourse started in Bali and to conclude in Copenhagen a \\npost-Kyoto regime that does not impede, but rather \\nsupports, the sustainable economic development to \\nwhich the developing countries aspire. Mechanisms \\nmaking an effective transfer of technology possible and \\nappropriate financing available are, in our view, \\nindispensable tools for the post-2012 regime, with \\nrespect to both mitigation and adaptation as part and \\nparcel of an effective global multilateral regime, with \\nlegally binding emission reduction targets for \\nindustrialized countries and with contributions by each \\naccording to their means.  \\n Luxembourg, for its part, decided at the \\nbeginning of the year to systematically integrate the \\nquestion of adaptation to climate change into its \\ndevelopment programmes.  \\n However, climate change has a potential impact \\nnot only on development but on the security of \\ncountries. The initiatives of small developing Pacific \\nisland countries to refer this issue to the Assembly \\nseems to me most timely. It favourably complements \\nthe initiative by the Maldives at the seventh session of \\nthe Human Rights Council to take up the relationship \\nbetween climate change and the full enjoyment of \\nhuman rights. As I have already had the opportunity to \\nsay from this rostrum, to successfully take on climate \\nchange we must tackle it in all its complexity and face \\nit in a concerted manner. What better framework to do \\nso than the United Nations? \\n Since development needs, particularly in Africa, \\nhave been at the centre of our attention this week, \\nallow me to say a few words about some of the \\nconflicts in Africa which impede the development of \\nthe countries they are ravaging, and in whose solution \\nthe United Nations is heavily invested — unfortunately \\nnot always with the desired results.  \\n The conflict of Darfur is in its sixth year now, \\nand images of people devastated by attacks, \\ndisplacement, precarious life in the camps and the daily \\nfear of fresh violence continue to haunt the media, and \\nalso our minds. International efforts and efforts of the \\nUnited Nations to resolve the crisis, particularly \\nthrough joint deployment with the African Union of the \\nlargest peacekeeping mission ever decided on, and the \\ncentral role of mediation in the search for a political \\nsolution may continue to be in vain if the parties to the \\nconflict, blinded by their short-term interests, continue \\nto lack the necessary political will to commit \\nthemselves to a lasting solution.  \\n For a solution to Darfur to be lasting, it must \\ncomprise a number of components: security, by \\ncessation of hostilities and a return to calm on the \\nground; political, by the conclusion of an agreement \\nfor the sharing of power and resources; humanitarian, \\nthrough effective measures to respond to immediate \\nhumanitarian needs and development needs of the \\npopulation; and judicial, of course, by the end of the \\nwidespread impunity for the crimes committed in \\nDarfur and bringing to justice the main perpetrators of \\nthe atrocities there to make a true reconciliation \\npossible. Peace and justice should go hand in hand in \\nDarfur, just as throughout the world. That is one of the \\nfundamental principles that guide Luxembourg’s \\nforeign policy. We cannot, nor should we, close our \\neyes to the serious crimes committed in Darfur. Any \\n  \\n \\n08-52265 42 \\n \\npolitical solution that would indefinitely put off justice \\nin Darfur would be flouting even further the rights of a \\npopulation that has been suffering for too long. \\n The European Union and my own country are \\nendeavouring to make their contribution with the \\ndeployment of the European Union force (EUFOR) in \\nChad and the Central African Republic, a force charged \\nwith protecting the refugees of Darfur as well as \\ninternally displaced persons, and allowing the \\nhumanitarian community access to those vulnerable \\npeople in a volatile security environment. EUFOR \\nmust pave the path for a United Nations force starting \\nin the spring of next year. It is important that this \\ntransition occur under good circumstances, according \\nto the timetable, and that the force can deploy fully, in \\nthe interest of achieving lasting stability in the \\nsubregion. \\n Another conflict in Africa which concerns us \\ngreatly is the one in Somalia. Somalia has been in the \\ngrips of civil war for more than a generation now, and \\nthe consequences are felt throughout the entire region \\nof the Horn of Africa. The signing of the Djibouti \\nagreement several weeks ago between the Transitional \\nGovernment and an opposition party will perhaps open \\nthe way to a lasting stabilization of Somalia. Only by \\nconsolidating the political situation and improving \\nsecurity can the international community fully carry \\nout its peacekeeping efforts in that country in the wake \\nof the African Union, which has deployed a \\npeacekeeping force under extremely trying \\ncircumstances. I welcome the efforts under way in the \\nSecurity Council to give concrete form, when \\nconditions permit, to the firm commitment entered into \\nby the international community and the United Nations \\nto help Somalia. \\n Much more could, indeed, be said about the \\nsituation in Africa. We are concerned over the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where fighting has \\nrecently resumed. In Zimbabwe, one must hope that all \\nforms of intimidation and violence will now be ended \\nso that that battered country can recover. However, \\nmore could also be said about the positive \\ndevelopments in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where it has \\nbeen possible to put in place an integrated strategy for \\npeacebuilding and to draw up a reliable way out of the \\ncrisis. \\n The sum of $700 billion has been at the centre of \\nconcerns over financial policy this week. It appears \\nthat this staggering sum has been deployed in order to \\nrepair the damage of the capitalism of the casino-like \\nbanking sector that relies on debt and speculation to \\nachieve precarious growth. Imagine, for a moment, this \\nsum being applied to achieve the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals upheld by this Assembly in 2000 \\nand 2005. Millions of children could survive. Millions \\nof women would not die during or after childbirth. \\nMuch progress could be made against AIDS and \\nmalaria, or in education and training programmes for \\nmillions of poor people who live on one or two dollars \\na day. Take a moment to reflect on this. \\n I also want to mention another topic which \\nconcerns us a great deal, one where our Organization, \\nin cooperation with the Organization for Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European \\nUnion, should play a central role, namely, the conflicts \\nin Georgia. \\n As the President of the French Republic, \\nrepresenting the European Union, said a few days ago \\nfrom this rostrum, the European Union wants to act for \\npeace. It is prepared to make its contribution, \\nparticularly by deploying an on-the-ground observer \\nmission, and in the international discussions that \\nshould begin in mid-October in Geneva, with a view to \\na peaceful and lasting solution. Such a solution should \\nbe based on full respect for principles of independence, \\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, and we condemn \\nany action at odds with those principles. Additionally, \\nwe feel it is important to see that an independent \\ninvestigation be carried out on the Georgian conflict. \\n It is said that war kills truth first. The European \\nUnion has committed itself to stopping the violence \\nand getting the troops out of Georgia, which will \\nundoubtedly help the Georgian people in both \\nhumanitarian and security terms. The real reasons for \\nthe outbreak of this conflict cannot be left to historians. \\nLight must be shed on the situation. Therefore and \\nmost importantly, in order to avoid similar cases in the \\nfuture, the raison d’être of the United Nations is to \\nprevent the outbreak of armed conflict. If a conflict \\narises it is incumbent on all of us to investigate the \\nreasons and the circumstances in order to prevent other \\nclashes. \\n I also want to share what was said by the \\nPresident of the European Council regarding another \\ntopic, particularly after having heard the statement last \\nTuesday of the President of the Islamic Republic of \\n \\n \\n43 08-52265 \\n \\nIran before the General Assembly (see ). It is \\nintolerable that Iran should call for the destruction of \\nthe State of Israel. We cannot tolerate such anti-Semitic \\ncomments, particularly from this rostrum here in our \\nOrganization. \\n As so often, shadows of darkness and rays of \\nhope become intermingled when we analyse \\ninternational situations, but one constant remains true: \\nthe importance of an effective multilateral system. \\n The United Nations could be even more effective \\nif it were to continue its internal reform efforts. \\nUnfortunately, there is a certain fatigue with regard to \\nreform of the Organization. This is particularly \\nregrettable because global challenges cannot wait. A \\nmore cohesive and effective Organization would \\nbenefit us all. Let us not hesitate to redouble our efforts \\nto honour our reform commitments of 2005. \\n With regard to the reform of the Security \\nCouncil, I am pleased that we are finally going to begin \\nintergovernmental negotiations at the beginning of \\n2009. I hope that those negotiations will quickly \\nachieve results. I also hope that the reformed Council \\nwill be more representative, but above all, I hope that it \\nwill perform better and be more transparent, thereby \\nensuring greater effectiveness and enhanced legitimacy \\nand implementation of its decisions. \\n Other areas of reform agreed in 2005, such as the \\nmanagement of the Organization, have not yet been \\naddressed. I therefore encourage the Secretary-General \\nto pursue his effort to reform human resources \\nmanagement on the basis of the three pillars of \\ntransparency, effectiveness and the taking of \\nresponsibility.  \\n With regard to system-wide coherence, we should \\npursue our efforts in the areas of operational activities, \\ncommercial practices and environmental initiatives. We \\nmust essentially move away from the fragmented \\nsystem that has evolved in the course of the past \\n60 years of United Nations history. \\n In conclusion, I think it very important to once \\nagain draw the Assembly’s attention to our collective \\ndecision regarding the responsibility to protect people \\nagainst genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \\ncrimes against humanity. We should continue to work \\non the concept of the responsibility to protect, which \\nshould be implemented in the framework of criteria \\nand conditions set out in the final document of the \\n2005 Summit (resolution 60/1), so as to progressively \\nestablish an irrefutable basis upon which the \\ninternational community can act in accordance with a \\ngiven situation.  \\n As a founding Member of the Organization, my \\ncountry endeavours to contribute to the purposes and \\nprinciples of the Charter through resolute and ongoing \\nsolidarity, through concrete involvement in efforts \\naimed at development, peace, security and respect for \\nhuman rights, and through the determined pursuit of a \\nmultilateral approach with the United Nations at the \\ncore. It is in that same spirit that, as we did in 2001, \\nLuxembourg has presented its candidacy for a \\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \\nperiod 2013 and 2014. That too is how we intend to \\ncontinue to shoulder our share of responsibility in this \\nAssembly.  ', 'These days, on our \\ntelevision screens, images of thousands of parents \\nconcerned about the health of their babies and children \\nremind us of what lies at the very heart of our work — \\nbuilding a better future for the coming generations, at \\nhome as well as here in the United Nations. \\n Armed conflict, climate change, poverty, hunger \\nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \\nare the bleak challenges we face today, together with \\nnew global challenges such as increasing food and \\nenergy prices and financial turbulence. A sense of \\nshared responsibility and true partnership based on \\nequality are the key qualities that must guide our \\nefforts to meet these challenges. \\n All inhabitants of the global village have the right \\nas well as the duty to contribute to the well-being of \\nour community. At the global level, that needs to be \\ndone in the framework of an effective world \\norganization that enjoys the trust of States and \\nGovernments but also of societies and individual \\ncitizens. \\n A just and effective international order needs to \\nbe based on rules equally applicable to every member, \\nbig or small, strong or weak. Respect for the rule of \\nlaw is indispensable if we want to prevent conflicts and \\npromote peace and sustainable development. Austria \\nhas therefore consistently promoted efforts to develop \\ninternational relations based on the principles of the \\n  \\n \\n08-52272 40 \\n \\nCharter of the United Nations and all the other \\ninstruments that form our international legal system. \\n Three weeks ago, 130 human rights experts and \\npractitioners from around the world came together in \\nVienna 15 years after the World Conference on Human \\nRights held in Vienna in 1993. They formulated \\nrecommendations on how to overcome the gap between \\nhuman rights standards and the reality of their \\nimplementation on the ground. Those recommendations \\nhave been submitted to the General Assembly and the \\nHuman Rights Council, and I hope they will contribute \\nto the deliberations on the occasion of the sixtieth \\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights on 10 December. \\n One of the basic threats to the rule of law is \\nimpunity. Today, international criminal justice, as \\ndispensed by the International Criminal Court as well \\nas by the special tribunals established by the Security \\nCouncil, has become a major tool for bringing to \\njustice those responsible for war crimes and crimes \\nagainst humanity.  \\n Nowadays, some speak about the “peace — \\njustice dilemma”. I personally remain convinced that \\npeace and justice are complementary objectives, both \\nare equally essential. There can be no lasting peace \\nwithout justice, and international justice will serve its \\npurpose most fully and effectively if it helps societies \\nadvance reconciliation and overcome the wounds of the \\npast. As women and children are often the most \\nvulnerable in our societies, they deserve our special \\nattention in this context. \\n No country, no society can succeed without \\nrecognizing the contribution of women. Worldwide, \\nwomen are the politically and socially most relevant \\nemerging power of the twenty-first century. Their \\ncontribution must be valued publicly, their \\nparticipation encouraged, their potential fully used. \\nThere are countless success stories of women leaders \\nwho make a difference in their communities as \\nbusinesswomen, mothers, teachers, farmers, workers, \\npeacemakers and lawmakers. \\n At the same time, we hear appalling reports from \\naround the world of discrimination and violence \\nagainst women. How can we speak of human rights for \\nwomen as long as one out of every three women \\nworldwide has been beaten or abused? It is the \\nresponsibility of each and every Government to act on \\nthis. The United Nations must take the lead by setting \\nclear targets and establishing a network to share best \\npractices in combating violence against women. \\n Last year, the Women Leaders Network called on \\nthe Secretary-General to appoint more women to \\nleadership positions in the United Nations, in particular \\nin mediation and peacebuilding. I am pleased that the \\nSecretary-General has since entrusted a number of \\noutstanding women with key positions both at \\nHeadquarters and in the field, and I encourage him to \\ncontinue this policy. \\n With regard to Security Council resolution 1325 \\n(2000) on women, peace and security, the European \\nUnion (EU) policy of targeted support for women in \\nand through peace missions could be extended to other \\nregional organizations such as the African Union. To \\nassess the practical results of resolution 1325 (2000), I \\npropose a thorough review process on the occasion of \\nits tenth anniversary in 2010. \\n Recent events in Georgia are a stark reminder that \\nthe scourge of war still haunts our European \\nneighbourhood. The European Union is ready to work \\ntogether with the Organization for Security and \\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the \\nUnited Nations so that Georgia can return to peace, all \\ninternally displaced people can return safely and a \\nlasting solution based on full respect for the \\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia is \\nfound. I also call upon the Security Council to decide \\non a timely prolongation of the United Nations \\nObserver Mission in Georgia. \\n As for the Western Balkans, I am heartened that \\nwe are moving from the crisis management phase to \\nthe integration phase. Today, thanks to the stabilizing \\nrole of the EU, the peoples of the Western Balkans \\nenjoy peace. Their future lies in the European Union. \\n Austria welcomes the progress recently achieved \\nin Zimbabwe. We hope that this will become another \\nlasting example of the capacity of Africa for the \\npeaceful resolution of conflicts on its continent. \\nRegional ownership is the best option for success. \\n Austria continues to actively support efforts to \\nbring an end to decades of conflict in the Middle East. \\nThree months ago, we hosted a donor conference in \\nVienna for the reconstruction of the Nahr el-Bared \\nrefugee camp in northern Lebanon in order to improve \\nthe fate of the Palestinian refugees there and to support \\n \\n \\n41 08-52272 \\n \\nstability, the rule of law and economic development in \\nLebanon. \\n I commend the Israeli and Palestinian leadership \\nfor their commitment to dialogue and negotiations \\ndespite repeated efforts by radical forces to undermine \\nthe process started in Annapolis nearly a year ago. \\nOngoing settlements and expansion, however, put our \\ncommon vision in question. The two-State solution \\nremains the only possible path towards a peaceful and \\nprosperous Middle East that can provide lasting \\nsecurity to all its inhabitants. \\n I remain convinced that in international relations as \\ninside our own societies, we must always support \\ndialogue. Austria will continue her long-standing \\ncommitment to the dialogue of cultures and religions with \\na clear focus on the contribution of religious leaders, \\nwomen, young people, the media and educators. \\n With some 500,000 victims each year, small arms \\nand light weapons are today’s real weapons of mass \\ndestruction. Africa is the continent most heavily \\naffected by this problem. Together with her African \\npartners, Austria works for real progress on the \\ndestruction of small arms as well as on the fight against \\nthe illicit arms trade. We also cooperate in developing \\nsuitable legal instruments. \\n Austria is also deeply involved in establishing an \\ninternational legally binding ban on cluster munitions. \\nThe Convention on Cluster Munitions that we adopted \\nin Dublin this year is a milestone in the field of \\ndisarmament and humanitarian law. Austria will sign \\nthe Convention in Oslo on 3 December 2008. I appeal \\nto all other countries to sign as soon as possible so that \\nthis treaty can enter into force swiftly. \\n The need to prevent nuclear proliferation at a \\ntime when an increasing number of countries are \\nlooking towards nuclear power as a means to produce \\nenergy calls for courageous and creative solutions. \\nAustria has presented a proposal in the framework of \\nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the \\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that aims \\nat the comprehensive multilateralization of the nuclear \\nfuel cycle. The goal is a fair system under which all \\nStates who wish to receive nuclear fuel for an \\nexclusively peaceful use can do so under equal \\nconditions through the IAEA. \\n With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme, we \\nare convinced that the double-track approach is the \\nbest way forward. At the same time, it is indispensable \\nthat Iran fully complies with the relevant Security \\nCouncil resolutions. In this context we commend and \\nstrongly support the efforts of the IAEA Director \\nGeneral, Mohamed El Baradei. \\n Let me draw the Assembly’s attention to the new \\npartnership we developed and adopted at the Lisbon \\nSummit in December 2007: the Joint Africa-European \\nUnion Strategy based on the three aims of peace, \\nsecurity and development. Without peace and security \\nthere can be no sustainable development, and there is \\nno security without human security. Human trafficking, \\ndrugs, proliferation of weapons, unemployment and \\ncrime — they all affect the very cohesion of our \\nsocieties. \\n In order to better address the challenges faced by \\nAfrica, Austria, together with the Economic \\nCommunity of West African States and the Southern \\nAfrican Development Community, respectively, \\nrecently organized a conference on peace and security \\nin West Africa, in Ouagadougou, and a seminar on \\npeace and development in Southern Africa, in \\nJohannesburg. \\n We need the turbo power of innovation to address \\nglobal challenges. Climate change is not only \\nresponsible for natural disasters but poses what is \\nperhaps the most serious threat to the achievement of \\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For some \\nsmall island States climate change and the resulting sea \\nlevel rise are threats to their very existence. Austria \\ntherefore welcomes the initiative by the Pacific island \\nStates for a General Assembly resolution on the threat \\nof climate change to international peace and security. \\nUrgent action towards a global climate agreement by \\nthe end of 2009 is the only way forward. We also \\npropose to develop the United Nations Environment \\nProgramme into a fully fledged World Environment \\nOrganization. Furthermore, we support the creation of \\na new International Renewable Energy Agency. Vienna \\nis a suitable location to host such an agency, as many \\nof its United Nations offices already deal with energy \\nquestions. \\n Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger \\ncontinues to be one of the main challenges of the \\ninternational community. At the midpoint towards \\n2015, success in achieving the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals has been uneven. While many \\ncountries have made significant progress in attaining \\n  \\n \\n08-52272 42 \\n \\nsome of the Goals, only a few are likely to reach all of \\nthem. Urgent and increased efforts by the international \\ncommunity are, therefore, needed. The active \\ncontribution towards this global effort is a priority for \\nthe Austrian Government. \\n As a matter of urgency we also have to tackle the \\nmultiple and complex causes of the current global food \\ncrisis. We welcome the High-Level Task Force set up \\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, which aims to \\ncreate an international strategy for food security, and \\nwe eagerly await the first concrete results. \\n Small and medium-sized countries have a specific \\ninterest in an international system based on effective \\nmultilateralism and the rule of law. They form the \\nbackbone of the United Nations. They can make a \\ndifference and act as a driving force on many issues \\nbeneficial to the world community. \\n Since joining the United Nations more than \\n50 years ago, Austria has consistently worked for \\nmultilateral solutions to global challenges. Our \\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \\nCouncil is one expression of our determination to serve \\nthe world Organization. That is the most important \\nresponsibility that can be entrusted to a Member of the \\nUnited Nations. We stand ready to assume that \\nresponsibility and ask Members for their support. We \\npledge to work for common solutions to our common \\nglobal challenges in a sense of true partnership.', 'I offer my \\ncongratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on \\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \\nsixty-third session. I wish him every success. \\n The United Nations mandate to establish and \\nmaintain peace and security has lost none of its \\nurgency in 2008. The task remains. However, fulfilling \\nit is more demanding than ever. \\n When the Berlin Wall fell, no one had greater \\nhopes than we Germans not only that Germany would \\nbe reunited but that a new age of global cooperation — \\nbeyond the traditional front lines — would begin. The \\nIron Curtain had divided the world into two blocs and \\nwhen it came to dealing with crises and conflicts, often \\nenough, loyalty within the blocs had priority; what was \\nneeded to improve the lot of ordinary people was of \\nsecondary importance. \\n \\n \\n47 08-52265 \\n \\n The end of the East-West confrontation in the \\nearly nineties seemed to mark the dawn of a new age of \\neffective multilateralism, while the United Nations \\nseemed to be on the threshold of a great renaissance. \\nDisillusionment has now set in, more quickly and more \\nprofoundly than we had feared. The hoped-for peace \\ndividend did not materialize. On the contrary, the \\ncynical certainties of the cold war had disappeared, and \\nthey were not replaced by new ones.  \\n The world is clearly searching for a new order, \\nand multilateralism does not always seem to be the first \\nchoice in this quest. What we have experienced since \\nthen is the confluence of the traditional power politics \\nof the 19th century, the legacies of the cold war and the \\nnew challenges of the 21st century. \\n At the same time, new players and Powers that \\nhave still to find their place in the international order \\nare seeking to enter the global stage. It is now \\ngenerally accepted that we can master the new \\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, such as climate \\nchange, scarcity of raw materials, access to food and \\nwater and the fight against epidemics, pandemics and \\nterrorism, only if we act together. Although we know \\nthat and although it is absolutely vital that we focus on \\nfinding common solutions to the key issues of the \\nfuture, time and again we are called upon to resolve \\nconflicts that have their roots in a past that we have \\nonly seemingly put behind us. \\n One conflict that smouldered for some time and \\nthen escalated suddenly and violently is the crisis in \\nGeorgia, where an entire region found itself on the \\nedge of the abyss of war and destruction and where \\ncommon sense failed to prevail on all sides. The United \\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \\nin Europe (OSCE) and the European Union agree that \\nthe weapons must be silenced for good. We must help \\nthe suffering population without delay. That does not \\nmean accepting the status quo; nor does it mean the \\ncalling into question of Georgia’s territorial integrity. \\n Nevertheless, we have to work together to ensure \\nreconstruction, the return home of the refugees and \\nlong-term security in Georgia and the entire region. \\nThe European Union is making an important \\ncontribution by sending an observer mission, which my \\ncountry is leading. Together with the United Nations \\nand the OSCE, the mission will put forward a \\ncomprehensive strategy in Geneva this October. We are \\naiming to pave the way towards the durable resolution \\nof the conflict through stabilization and confidence-\\nbuilding in this particular region of the world, the \\nSouthern Caucasus. \\n The same task is even more demanding in \\nAfghanistan, a country where the situation is still \\nprecarious. It is clear to us that, without security, \\nAfghanistan will not, and indeed cannot, develop. \\nEqually, however, we need economic development in \\norder to improve the security situation and to \\nencourage people to reject fundamentalism and terror. \\n We have achieved much together in recent \\nmonths and years. Millions of children — many of \\nthem girls — are going to school again, while streets, \\nbridges and hospitals are being built. The training and \\nbuild-up of the Afghan police force and army are \\nprogressing. Compared to the deteriorating security \\nsituation, however, they are not progressing fast \\nenough, especially in the present situation. Germany \\nintends to do even more in the future. \\n However, we cannot afford to look at Afghanistan \\nby itself. We need to step up our efforts to help \\nPakistan master the economic and social challenges it \\nfaces. Pakistan’s internal stability is crucial to stability \\nin the entire region. This will require concrete support \\nfrom everyone in the international community, and my \\ncountry — rest assured — will play its part. \\n International engagement is also still necessary in \\nthe Middle East. In the current phase of domestic \\nuncertainty, we call upon all parties to the conflict not \\nto ease up in their efforts to resolve the conflict. As \\nexperience has shown, to stand still in the Middle East \\noften means to take a step backward. A new wave of \\nterror and violent clashes would result, and neither \\nIsrael nor Palestine, nor the international community, \\ncan afford to let that happen. \\n Germany believes it has a particular \\nresponsibility to provide concrete assistance to \\nimprove the framework conditions. Just recently, at the \\nBerlin Conference in Support of Palestinian Civil \\nSecurity and the Rule of Law — which many of those \\nhere attended — we agreed on concrete measures to \\nstrengthen the Palestinian security sector. Those \\nmeasures are already having an impact. \\n An Iran armed with nuclear weapons would pose \\na threat to security throughout the Middle East and \\nwould trigger a nuclear arms race. Therefore, Iran must \\nput its cards on the table. We have made our offer, \\n  \\n \\n08-52265 48 \\n \\nwhich is a tangible solution. The delaying tactics of the \\nIranian side must not exhaust the patience of the \\ninternational community. We expect a clear signal from \\nIran indicating its willingness to comply with the \\ninternational community’s demands and to build \\nconfidence. And let me make the following very clear: \\nthe Iranian President’s remarks concerning Israel are \\nirresponsible and unacceptable. In my view, the blatant \\nanti-Semitism that he expressed in his statement once \\nagain this year (see ) is outrageous and \\nshould be condemned by all of us. We must stand \\ntogether on that issue. \\n The problems in Georgia, Afghanistan, Pakistan \\nand the Middle East highlight one fact: it is more \\nurgent than ever that we develop the foundations for a \\nstable world order. My country stands for dialogue and \\nthe reconciliation of interests. That does not mean \\ndialogue for the sake of discussion, without any \\nresults; nor does reconciliation of interests imply that \\nwe are prepared to abandon our own principles. We \\nbelieve that it is essential to renounce violence, ensure \\nfairness and recognize international law.  \\n For us, that is the alternative vision to a world of \\nfabricated opposing interests, the bloc mentality and \\noversimplified categories such as good and evil. East \\nagainst West, North against South — that is yesterday’s \\nthinking, and it no longer has a place in today’s world. \\nIn order to resolve the problems of today and \\ntomorrow, we all need more partners, not more \\nopponents. The twenty-first century is the first in \\nwhich we can resolve problems only if we work \\ntogether. \\n The same applies to disarmament policy. Only a \\npartnership of shared global responsibility can achieve \\nlasting results. The dangerous trend in which an ever-\\nincreasing number of countries strive to gain access to \\nnuclear technology, or even to build nuclear weapons, \\nmust be stopped. My proposal to multilateralize the \\nfuel cycle showed how those risks can at the very least \\nbe minimized. Furthermore, I call upon all States to \\nsign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, \\nbecause its entry into force would mean a huge gain in \\nsecurity. \\n For all that, however, we must remember that \\nmore people die every day as a result of hunger than as \\na result of war. The pledges that we made at the turn of \\nthe millennium must not remain a mere piece of paper. \\nThe fight against hunger and poverty is also part of a \\nglobal responsibility partnership. Germany will \\ntherefore step up its efforts to promote poverty \\nreduction and global fairness. As part of those efforts, \\nwe will increase our official development assistance \\ncontributions in accordance with the plan of the \\nEuropean Union. In the next budget alone, we will \\nincrease development assistance by $1.2 billion.  \\n In that connection, I would like to say something \\nabout Africa. For too long, we have perceived that part \\nof the world only as a continent of wars and conflicts. \\nHowever, I also know an Africa that has set off on the \\nroad to the future with courage and resolve. It deserves \\nour partnership and support along that road. \\n At present, the headlines are dominated by the \\ninternational financial crisis. Recklessness, greed and a \\nlack of common sense among those involved has set us \\nback years. The long-term consequences cannot be \\nassessed yet. However, I am certain that the painful \\ntremors on the world financial markets will accelerate \\nthe multipolarization of the international financial \\nsystem. There can be no future without rules, and no \\nsingle player will be able to lay down those rules. It \\nwill no longer be possible for any one country to act as \\nif it were immune to undesirable developments. \\nEurope, with its tried-and-tested policy of mediation \\nand reconciliation of interests, could play a key role in \\nthis. \\n Together, we must now finally ensure long-\\noverdue transparency, stability and provisions to guard \\nagainst risks on the world financial markets, along with \\noversight. My country developed concrete proposals in \\nthat regard a few years ago. I hope that, in the face of \\nthis deep crisis, the international community will now \\nact quickly and with resolve. We need universal rules \\nfor the international financial markets. \\n That does not apply only to the international \\nfinancial sphere, however; clear rules, solid structures \\nand joint action are the vital prerequisites for meeting \\nglobal challenges. That is why we need a strong and \\neffective United Nations that enjoys the confidence of \\nthe international community, has the requisite \\nlegitimacy and can be the umbrella for a global \\nresponsibility partnership. \\n We therefore support the process of reforming the \\nUnited Nations and its organs. Security Council reform \\nis overdue, as we are all aware. The Council’s \\ncomposition must reflect the realities of world politics \\ntoday. Germany is prepared to shoulder greater \\n \\n \\n49 08-52265 \\n \\nresponsibility in that area. Less than two weeks ago, \\nthe General Assembly unanimously decided to begin \\nthe negotiations on reform soon (see decision 62/557). \\nThat important step must now be followed by others. \\nGermany is firmly convinced that, in the twenty-first \\ncentury, we need the United Nations more urgently \\nthan ever before. ', 'I \\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the President of \\nthe Swiss Confederation, Mr. Pascal Couchepin, who \\nhad to cancel his trip to New York at the very last \\nminute. \\n Since its foundation, the United Nations has \\nembodied the hope of all people to live in peace, \\nfreedom and dignity. As Members of the United \\nNations and as representatives of our peoples, we are \\nunder an obligation not to disappoint those hopes. \\nThree years ago in this Hall, we decided in the 2005 \\nWorld Summit Outcome to ensure that human beings \\nwould live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty \\nand despair. We ought now to ask ourselves the \\nfollowing questions: Have we kept that promise? Have \\nthe expectations been fulfilled? Have we done enough \\nto bring about peace and security, development and the \\nrealization of human rights? \\n According to a recent World Bank report, the \\nnumber of people living in poverty has fallen by 500 \\nmillion since 1981. Their proportion of the total \\npopulation has fallen from 52 to 26 per cent. \\nNevertheless, 1.2 billion people still have to get by on \\nless than a dollar a day. Twenty-five thousand people a \\nday are dying as a result of starvation and poverty. \\nThere are still 67 million refugees and internally \\ndisplaced persons on the planet. No State, however \\nwealthy or powerful, can tackle all these challenges \\nalone. Common solutions are required. A strong United \\nNations is needed, a United Nations that focuses on \\nthat which unites rather than on that which divides. \\n Cooperation across cultural and religious borders \\nis not always easy. Swiss history has shown that this \\ntype of cooperation is most likely to bear fruit when \\nspecific problems are tackled and solutions are sought \\nthrough open dialogue. This approach is reflected in \\nSwiss peace policy. We support projects the purpose of \\nwhich is to bring together people with different values \\nand cultural backgrounds to enable them to coexist in a \\npositive way. This approach also characterizes our \\nactivity in the United Nations-sponsored Alliance of \\nCivilizations. \\n Although dialogue is necessary, it is nevertheless \\nonly one of the means of promoting the fundamental \\nvalues to which we are all devoted. I am thinking first \\nand foremost of human rights, access to a decent \\nstandard of living and personal development for \\neveryone. \\n In this context, Switzerland is participating \\nactively in the work of the Human Rights Council. Let \\nus recall that the usefulness of the Council will \\nultimately be judged by the specific contribution that it \\nmakes to the protection of human rights on the ground. \\n \\n \\n33 08-53141 \\n \\nThe Universal Periodic Review and its special \\nprocedures provide the Council with two effective \\ntools, and those tools must be used. Switzerland will \\ncontinue to advocate in favour of a constructive and \\ncritical Universal Periodic Review, the independence \\nof special procedures and the autonomy of the Office \\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \\nRights. \\n Next year, the Review Conference on the \\nimplementation of the Durban Declaration and \\nProgramme of Action will take place at Durban. For \\nSwitzerland, the fight against racism is a priority. That \\nis why my country will play its part in this process. \\nHowever, we expect the preparatory phase to be \\ncharacterized by a constructive spirit that helps us \\nachieve a balanced outcome. In particular, the Review \\nConference should confine itself to the evaluation of \\nthe implementation of the Durban Declaration and \\nProgramme of Action. It should not call into question \\nthe normative advances set out in the International \\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \\nDiscrimination. And finally, it should deal with \\ndifferent subjects relating to racism in a balanced \\nmanner, without becoming a platform that focuses on a \\nparticular situation. \\n Last week, the Assembly also discussed the \\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \\nWe all know that the implementation of the Goals is \\nslow and arduous. Collectively, we could have done \\nmore. We should have done more, and Switzerland is \\nno exception. But we are trying to assign our limited \\nresources to actions that meet the needs of recipients, \\nthat make a difference to the poorest, that help people \\nto help themselves and that complement, but do not \\nreplace, the efforts of recipient countries. \\n Development assistance should be characterized \\nby lasting effectiveness and coherence. The Follow-Up \\nInternational Conference on Financing for \\nDevelopment, to be held in Doha, will give us an \\nopportunity to renew and to deepen this alliance \\nbetween developing and industrialized countries. \\n Progress towards the achievement of the \\nMillennium Development Goals requires that the \\nworld’s poorest be better protected legally. Only if they \\ncan defend themselves against injustice and have equal \\naccess to justice, property, work and markets will \\ndevelopment ultimately be possible. The Commission \\non Legal Empowerment of the Poor presented its report \\na few months ago. It deserves careful study and follow-\\nup by the Assembly. \\n The food crisis has undoubtedly made achieving \\nthe Millennium Development Goals more difficult. \\nLike some other countries, Switzerland has responded \\nto the crisis by increasing its contribution to the World \\nFood Programme. But the causes of food price rises \\nalso need to be addressed. The causes are diverse and \\nrange from changing eating habits to increased \\ncultivation of agrofuel crops and neglect of agricultural \\nproduction. Measures to resolve this crisis will have to \\nbe both numerous and varied. In this regard, we \\nwelcome the efforts made by the High-Level Task \\nForce on the Global Food Security Crisis in providing \\na coherent and efficient response. \\n However, there is also a positive side to this \\ncrisis. Rising food prices may also represent an \\nopportunity for farmers in developing countries. But \\nfor farmers to benefit from the rise in food prices they \\nneed access to land and property, financing and seed. \\nLikewise, they need international rules against the \\nflooding of their sales markets by subsidized \\nagricultural products, as well as better access to the \\nmarkets of industrialized countries. \\n A positive conclusion of the World Trade \\nOrganization (WTO) discussions could have been a \\npositive sign of movement in this direction. \\nSwitzerland therefore regrets that it was not possible to \\nreach agreement at the Ministerial Meeting held in \\nGeneva in July. The challenge now is to ensure that the \\nprogress already made is not jeopardized and that \\nconfidence among WTO member States is restored, so \\nthat the Doha Round can be brought to a successful \\nconclusion. \\n Climate change is another major source of \\nconcern. We in Switzerland are particularly aware of \\nthis fact because our alpine glaciers are rapidly melting \\naway. In other parts of the world, this phenomenon \\ntakes the form of changing precipitation patterns, \\ndroughts and floods. The reports of the \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \\nclearly show that all these disasters have a point in \\ncommon: they are the result of climate change and are \\ncaused by human beings, and particularly by the \\nconsumption of fossil fuels. \\n The time for never-ending talks has passed. \\nSwitzerland will achieve its emissions reduction goals \\nfor 2012. For the years after 2012, we need a new, \\n  \\n \\n08-53141 34 \\n \\nambitious and internationally accepted climate regime. \\nSuch a regime should be based on the principle of \\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. Switzerland \\nhas put forward a proposal for a global carbon dioxide \\ntax which meets that criterion and would ensure the \\nfinancing of the necessary adaptation measures. I \\nwould like to invite the Assembly to carefully study \\nthis proposal in the framework of the ongoing climate \\ndiscussions. \\n The efforts of the industrialized countries alone \\nwill not be enough, however, to solve the problem of \\nglobal warming. Each country will, according to its \\nown capacities, have to contribute to the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions. In so doing, we are united by a \\ncommon concern: that of shouldering our responsibility \\nto future generations. \\n Today, many countries are still in situations of \\narmed conflict. In many cases, respect for international \\nhumanitarian law has declined. That is why \\nSwitzerland calls again on all conflicting parties to \\ncomply with the provisions of international \\nhumanitarian law and to guarantee humanitarian \\norganizations swift and unhindered access to the \\nvictims of conflicts. \\n Conflict prevention is one of the central tasks of \\nthe United Nations. Switzerland is particularly active \\non two levels. First, we wish to pay closer attention to \\nthe connection between armed violence and \\ndevelopment. Together with other partners, we intend \\nto submit a draft resolution on this subject during this \\nsession of the General Assembly. Secondly, we \\nstrongly advocate the strengthening of the Secretariat’s \\nmediation capacities. The mediation efforts in Kenya, \\nfor instance, have demonstrated that this form of \\nconflict prevention can work. \\n That brings me to the subjects of the \\nresponsibility to protect and of prevention of genocide. \\nSwitzerland welcomes the fact that these subjects have \\nbeen institutionally anchored more firmly within the \\nUnited Nations. \\n The concept of the responsibility to protect was \\nrecognized in September 2005 in the framework of the \\nWorld Summit. It is obvious that the operational \\nimplementation of the concept can only be realized \\nprogressively. Nevertheless, Switzerland will commit \\nto ensuring that the concept is not partially assimilated \\ninto that of humanitarian intervention, thereby calling \\ninto question the consensus achieved in 2005. \\n Justice is necessary for building lasting peace. In \\nother words, peace and impunity are incompatible in \\nthe long term. The arrest and extradition of Charles \\nTaylor and Radovan Karadzic to The Hague have once \\nagain confirmed the importance of international \\ncriminal justice. Alleged war criminals must not be \\nallowed to live in serenity. They must answer for their \\nacts in a fair trial. That is the preventive effect of the \\ninternational criminal justice system, and it should not \\nbe underestimated. Switzerland therefore supports the \\nwork of the International Criminal Court and advocates \\nits independence. \\n At the beginning of my speech, I stressed the \\ngreat importance of the United Nations. The world is \\nchanging, however, and international relations are \\nconstantly developing. The United Nations will also \\nhave to change. Those who focus only on the past will \\nno doubt miss the future. \\n There is a need for reform in all United Nations \\nbodies, but particularly in the Security Council. Given \\nthe power that it exerts, the expectations of the \\nSecurity Council are very high. If its decisions are to \\nbe accepted and supported by the entire international \\ncommunity, the Council will need to adapt to the \\nrealities of the twenty-first century, namely, the new \\nbalances that characterize our world at the political, \\neconomic and demographic levels. \\n Moreover, it is important that the views of \\nimportant actors that are not members of the Council \\nshould be better taken into account in decision-making. \\nSwitzerland has for some time advocated an \\nimprovement of the Council’s working methods and \\nwill continue to work for greater participation and \\ntransparency. \\n Peace is not a given. It is an ideal that has to be \\npursued every day. The United Nations is the \\npredestined venue for achieving that goal. We are \\nwilling, within our capacities, to make our contribution \\nto that pressing collective task. ', 'When the present \\nsession of the General Assembly began on Tuesday, the \\nSecretary-General made important remarks about the \\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \\nfinancial crisis. The world is witnessing extraordinary \\nfinancial turbulence, and all parties must shoulder their \\nresponsibility. \\n At the same time, the current crisis should not \\ndistract us from the need to achieve the MDGs. What \\nkind of world do we want to leave to our children and \\ngrandchildren? Any parent who considers that question \\nfor a moment will answer: a world in which my \\nchildren are safe and can build decent lives, free from \\nwant; a world in which my children can reach their full \\npotential without fear of repression or terror; a world in \\nwhich my children are free and their rights are \\nprotected. \\n Everything that we do as the United Nations is \\nabout deep desires. There is a direct link between this \\nUnited Nations building and the homes of hundreds of \\nmillions of families all over the world. \\n One man who forcefully reminded us that we are \\nresponsible for the opportunities open to future \\ngenerations was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In early \\n1941, in the darkest hour of the Second World War, he \\ngave us his vision of the future: the dawning of a world \\nin which people would enjoy freedom of expression \\nand belief and would be free from fear and want. After \\nthe war, those freedoms became our moral compass. \\nThey were set out in the Universal Declaration of \\nHuman Rights, proclaimed by this very Assembly \\nalmost 60 years ago. Human rights remain the \\ncornerstone of Dutch policy. \\n If we look around us today, we can see that \\nreality falls far short of our ideal. We still live in a \\nworld where, each year, more than 9 million children \\ndie before they reach the age of five, and every day \\nmillions of people live in fear of violence and the \\nabuse of power. \\n We cannot accept that. Together, the United \\nNations comprises a working community and our work \\nis not done — not by a long way. Global challenges \\nrequire global solutions. Global solutions require \\nglobal action. Every one of us needs to ask ourselves: \\nWhat am I doing to make freedom a reality for people \\nat home and elsewhere? \\n What are we doing to bring about freedom from \\nwant? In the past 10 years, millions of people have \\nmanaged to escape from poverty. In Asia and parts of \\nAfrica, a great deal of progress has been made, thanks \\nto the efforts of many people. That progress should \\ninspire hope as we continue to work towards the \\nMillennium Development Goals. There is still so much \\nto do. In some countries, the situation is actually \\ngetting worse, especially where health is concerned. \\nOne child still dies every three seconds, one mother \\nevery minute. \\n All Governments need to realize that good and \\nethical governance is an essential foundation for \\ndevelopment, and realizing that, they must act \\naccordingly. That also applies to the current financial \\ncrisis, where urgent action is needed. The financial \\nsector and regulators should quickly implement the \\nrecommendations of the Financial Stability Forum: \\nstricter supervision, better risk management, greater \\ntransparency and enhanced accountability. That is how \\nto restore confidence in the financial markets and \\nprevent future crises. The International Monetary Fund \\nshould play a central role in that process by further \\n \\n \\n51 08-51851 \\n \\nstepping up its financial sector oversight. Together, we \\nshould re-establish the stability and integrity of the \\nfinancial system. \\n Governments have a duty to provide food for \\ntheir people. The international community will support \\nall those who fight against hunger, want and disease, \\nbut we must do so as efficiently as possible. We must \\nnot waste resources; the need is too great. Above all, \\nwe must work together. We must work together with \\nother Governments, certainly, but also with the \\nbusiness community and civil society. Public-private \\npartnership works. I meet more and more entrepreneurs \\nwho are committed to the Millennium Development \\nGoals and actively want to help. Let us grasp the hands \\nthey extend. \\n The Netherlands welcomes the initiative of \\nMr. d’Escoto Brockmann to place food security at the \\ncentre of this session of the General Assembly. Rising \\nfood prices hit the poor hardest. The position of small \\nfarmers is particularly important. If they are able to \\nincrease production, not only will their own families \\nbenefit, but the local community will too. That is why \\nthe Netherlands has earmarked extra funding for the \\ndevelopment of agriculture in developing countries.  \\n However, there can be no food without water. \\nWater is the source of all life — 1.8 billion people \\ncurrently have no proper access to clean drinking \\nwater, and their health, their very lives, are in the \\nbalance. So the Netherlands has joined with countries \\nthat believe that water is a human right, because access \\nto water is an essential part of freedom from want. \\n What are we doing to ensure that second essential \\nfreedom — freedom from fear? Millions of people still \\nlive in the middle of conflict and violence. We must \\nnot accept that. Over the past 60 years, United Nations \\npeace operations have played an important role in \\nending conflict. In many areas, the United Nations has \\nensured that dormant conflicts do not flare up again. So \\nour efforts must continue, undiminished. Yet peace \\noperations alone are not enough. The root cause of a \\nconflict is often a political dispute, and it often requires \\na political solution. \\n There is no place in a free society for torture. \\nThere is no place for the death penalty. We all strive \\nfor a life without fear, yet there are people who face \\nfear every day in order to defend human rights. To \\nrecognize those brave people, the Netherlands has \\nintroduced the Human Rights Defenders Tulip, a \\nspecial honour that will be awarded annually on \\nInternational Human Rights Day.  \\n In our free world, no one is above the law and no \\none is beneath it. The Netherlands is proud to host the \\nlegal capital of the world in the city of The Hague. We \\nwill continue to strive for an International Criminal \\nCourt that is supported by all Member States. In a safe \\nworld, right is stronger than might. Crimes that outrage \\nworld opinion must always be punished. The \\nInternational Criminal Court is there to support us in \\nthat task, and we must support the Court — all of us, \\nopenly and unconditionally. A wider acceptance of the \\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice will \\nalso strengthen the international legal order. \\n We also need to speak about freedom of \\nexpression and belief. The debate on that issue often \\nleads to misunderstandings, incomprehension and fears \\nthat national traditions may be swept aside. We can all \\nbe proud of our cultures and traditions, of the things \\nthat distinguish us from others. The challenge for every \\nGovernment is to affirm its people’s cultural and \\nreligious values and customs, and at the same time to \\nbuild bridges with the rest of the world — bridges that \\nenable people, organizations and religions to meet and \\ndraw closer. Finding the right balance is not easy, but it \\nis essential. \\n Governments are there for everyone — for men \\nand women; for people of all backgrounds and all \\nreligious convictions; for monks, priests, rabbis and \\nimams; and equally for those who do not believe in a \\nsupreme being. Religion offers people comfort and \\ninspiration in their personal lives. A religion is not a \\nsystem of dogmas that may be imposed on others by \\nforce, and it is certainly not a justification for using \\nviolence when one feels aggrieved.  \\n Everyone is free to profess his or her faith, to \\nchange religion or not to believe. We must all cherish \\nand defend the freedom of religion or belief. The same \\ngoes for the freedom of people to express their views, \\nand those freedoms go hand in hand. \\n We all know that there are countries in the world \\nwhere those freedoms are violated, and to those \\ncountries I say: Respect the right of every person to \\nfreedom of religion and freedom of expression. They \\nare universal rights. They are universal freedoms. At \\nthe same time, we must remind everyone who enjoys \\nthose freedoms of their responsibility — the \\n  \\n \\n08-51851 52 \\n \\nresponsibility to show the same respect to others that \\nwe claim for ourselves. \\n We need the United Nations to ensure those four \\nessential freedoms for which we stand, and the United \\nNations needs us. A strong United Nations is one in \\nwhich universal values are central — a United Nations \\nwith a fair and balanced Human Rights Council, a \\nUnited Nations that unites and delivers. When we \\nbegan building the United Nations together, the number \\nof countries worldwide in which people enjoyed a \\nreasonable level of freedom was around 15 per cent of \\nthe total. Today, more than 60 per cent of countries can \\nbe called free. \\n In the same period, the number of people \\nsuffering from malnutrition has fallen by several \\nhundred million. The number of armed conflicts is also \\ndeclining, however serious the situation remains in \\ncertain troubled regions. Progress is possible, but it \\ndoes not happen by itself. For the Netherlands, that is \\nan incentive to continue working, heart and soul, for “a \\nworld in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of \\nspeech and belief and freedom from fear and want”. \\n In conclusion, let me echo President Roosevelt’s \\nwords: “The world order which we seek is the \\ncooperation of free countries, working together in a \\nfriendly, civilized society.” ', 'This has been a truly \\nremarkable week, remarkable for the leadership shown \\nby the Secretary-General on climate change, the new \\npolicies of President Obama, which he so eloquently \\nset out before us, the constructive responses to those \\ninitiatives from many parts of the world and the \\nhistoric meeting of the Security Council, which \\ncommitted itself to a world without nuclear weapons. \\nWe have all witnessed something new and different: a \\ngenuine opportunity for a real renaissance of \\nmultilateralism. \\n There is a real chance to turn the United Nations \\nonce again into what was originally envisaged in the \\nCharter: not just a forum for discussion, but a place for \\naction, the central focal point of the efforts of the \\ninternational community to find common solutions to \\ncommon challenges. It will depend on each and every \\nMember of the Organization to make sure that this \\n \\n \\n21 09-52592 \\n \\nhistoric opportunity is seized. Cooperation is not a \\nmere option, but an indispensable necessity, if we want \\nto succeed. \\n Together, we must build a world based on \\npredictable and equitable rules applicable to every \\nMember, big or small, strong or weak. Adherence to \\nthe rule of law and the principles of the Charter is \\ncritical to conflict prevention, stability and sustainable \\nlong-term development. \\n A year ago, Member States entrusted my country \\nwith a seat on the Security Council for the years 2009-\\n2010. We take that responsibility very seriously. \\n One important focus of our work in the Council is \\nto improve the protection of civilians in armed conflict. \\nDespite significant progress, armed conflicts continue \\nto darken the lives of men, women and children in \\nmany parts of the world. \\n Austria has been working actively with others on \\nexpanding the monitoring and reporting of serious \\nviolations of children’s rights. Austria fully supports \\nSecurity Council resolution 1820 (2008) and the \\nfollow-up resolution to be adopted next week as a \\ndecisive response by the international community to \\nsexual violence in conflict situations. At the same time, \\nAustria attaches great importance to the participation \\nof women in the promotion of peace and security. \\nWomen must have a voice in every peace process \\nthroughout the world. \\n But many challenges remain. How can we \\nimprove the protection of civilians on the ground, in \\nparticular in situations in which the Council has \\nprovided peacekeeping operations with a clear \\nprotection mandate? How can we ensure better \\ncompliance by parties to conflict with their obligations \\nunder international humanitarian law — for instance, \\nto allow full access for humanitarian assistance? We \\nwill therefore use our Security Council presidency in \\nNovember to identify concrete measures to improve the \\nprotection of civilians. In order to do so, I invite all \\npartners to join me in an open debate on 13 November. \\nI am pleased that the Secretary-General has agreed to \\nparticipate. \\n In recent years, several peacekeeping missions — \\nsuch as the United Nations Organization Mission in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo — have been \\nmandated by the Council to ensure the physical \\nprotection of the civilian population.  \\n Its role of providing protection to refugees and \\ninternally displaced persons was a strong factor in \\nAustria’s decision to contribute troops to the European \\nUnion and United Nations Missions in Chad and the \\nCentral African Republic. Austria has also contributed \\nto the United Nations study analysing experience in the \\nimplementation of such protection mandates in peace \\noperations. We thus hope to contribute to the overall \\nefforts to reform United Nations peacekeeping. Our \\naim must be to have more effective and better-\\nresourced peacekeeping missions that are in a position \\nto implement their mandates in a credible and \\nconsistent manner. \\n To achieve sustainable peace, security and \\ndevelopment, peacekeeping must be complemented by \\nthe rebuilding of functioning institutions, particularly \\nin the judiciary and the security sector. In that context, \\nwe commend the efforts of the United Nations Office \\non Drugs and Crime in combating corruption, \\norganized crime and drug trafficking. \\n The Peacebuilding Commission is a new form of \\npartnership between countries emerging from conflict, \\ndonors and main providers of personnel to United \\nNations missions to ensure that support is tailored to \\nspecific local needs. Austria is committed to the work \\nof the Peacebuilding Commission, and has recently \\njoined the country-specific configuration for Sierra \\nLeone, a model case for successful peacebuilding. \\n Sustainable peace can be achieved only when a \\nsociety also addresses its past. The establishment of \\neffective justice and reconciliation mechanisms at the \\nnational level is crucial to end impunity and to ensure \\nthe rights of victims. Such efforts can be \\ncomplemented by international criminal justice \\nmechanisms, such as the ad hoc tribunals and the \\nInternational Criminal Court. \\n Peace, security and stability are preconditions for \\nsustainable development. Eradicating extreme poverty \\nand hunger continues to be one of the main challenges \\nfacing the international community. Achieving the \\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015 is far from \\nassured. In view of the global financial crisis, \\nincreased efforts by the international community are \\nurgently needed. Austria will contribute its share to \\nthat global endeavour. \\n All those efforts will be in vain if we are unable \\nto protect our planet. Climate change is a fundamental \\nthreat to humankind, aggravating poverty, hunger, \\n  \\n \\n09-52592 22 \\n \\nenvironmental degradation and insecurity, and thus \\nseriously threatening the achievement of the \\nMillennium Development Goals. The United Nations \\nClimate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen \\nin December must decide on concrete actions to curb \\nclimate change on the basis of mutual trust and strong \\ninternational cooperation. \\n Climate and energy measures can also be an \\nimportant part of our response to the current economic \\ncrisis. Investments in green technologies and \\nsustainable, affordable and stable energy supplies will \\nbenefit both the economy and the climate. \\n The Security Council summit on nuclear \\nnon-proliferation and disarmament held earlier this \\nweek issued a strong call for a world free of nuclear \\nweapons. For that vision to become reality, we need \\nprogress on several fronts.  \\n Austria, as Co-Chair, together with Costa Rica, of \\nthe 2007 Conference on Facilitating the Entry into \\nForce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \\nand co-leader of the process for the past two years, is \\nproud to have contributed to bringing the Treaty closer \\nto entering into force.  \\n As current Chair of the Conference on \\nDisarmament in Geneva, Austria is working hard to \\ntranslate the recent positive momentum into substantial \\nprogress, especially on a verifiable fissile material cut-\\noff treaty. \\n The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must be \\nreinforced. The Review Conference of Parties to the \\nTreaty to be held next year will have to agree on a \\npackage of measures and procedures that address the \\nkey issues, but most of all it will need to build trust and \\nconfidence. \\n Let me continue with three short remarks on \\nconventional disarmament.  \\n First, I appeal to all States to make a success of \\nthe Second Review Conference of the Ottawa \\nLandmines Ban Convention, to be held in Colombia in \\nDecember, and, in particular, to ensure improved \\nassistance to victims.  \\n Secondly, I welcome the growing support for the \\nConvention on Cluster Munitions, which Austria \\nratified in April. We appeal to all other States to sign \\nand ratify it as soon as possible. \\n Thirdly, we must counter the illegal proliferation \\nof small arms and light weapons. An arms trade treaty \\nwould be an important step in that regard. Hoping to \\ncontribute to speedy negotiations, Austria will host an \\ninternational conference in Vienna in February next \\nyear. \\n With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme, it \\nis indispensable that Iran fully comply with all relevant \\nSecurity Council resolutions and closely cooperate \\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency. The \\nmost recent announcement by the Government of Iran \\nconcerning an additional enrichment facility is \\ndiscouraging and further increases our concern. \\n As an important regional actor, Iran has the \\nresponsibility to contribute to peace and security in the \\narea. The time has now come for Iran to finally enter \\ninto a constructive dialogue with the international \\ncommunity. Iran should therefore grasp the hand \\nextended by its international partners and engage in \\ngenuine and serious negotiations. The debates during \\nthis week have clearly shown that the world will not \\naccept an Iran armed with nuclear weapons. \\n Let me also underline that Austria firmly rejects \\nthe unacceptable remarks made by President \\nAhmadinejad during his speech on Wednesday. We \\nreject any abuse of the United Nations General \\nAssembly as a platform for intolerance, anti-Semitism, \\nand racial hatred. \\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium), Vice-President took the \\nChair. \\n Regarding the Middle East, we saw this week’s \\nsummit between President Obama, Prime Minister \\nNetanyahu and President Abbas as a sign of hope. We \\nappeal to the parties to remove any remaining obstacles \\nto the early resumption of negotiations. \\n After decades of hostility and violence, time has \\ncome to move decisively forward. Israel’s right to exist \\nin security and peace and the realization of the rights \\nof the Palestinian people to their own State are not \\nmutually exclusive. On the contrary, they are both \\ncrucial elements of a comprehensive and just solution. \\n Austria will continue to help establish the \\neconomic foundation and the institutional \\ninfrastructure of a future Palestine State. It will also, \\nwithin the framework of the European Union, \\ncontribute to the efforts to promote a dynamic and \\nresults-oriented peace process. \\n \\n \\n23 09-52592 \\n \\n International cooperation and dialogue are the \\nbasis for sustainable peace and development. Only by \\nclosely working together will we be able to \\nsuccessfully address the many challenges of today’s \\nglobalized world. We therefore appreciate President \\nTreki’s initiative to make the need for dialogue a main \\ntheme of this week’s debate. Situated in the heart of \\nEurope, and for most of its history at the crossroads of \\ndifferent cultures, religions and political systems, \\nAustria has developed a practice of constructive \\ndialogue as the host country of one of the seats of the \\nUnited Nations for the past three decades. \\n I have made it one of my foreign policy priorities \\nto position Austria even more firmly as a platform for \\npeace and dialogue. We stand ready to host \\ninternational negotiations and provide our services, as \\nwe did most recently for the informal talks on Western \\nSahara. Austria can be counted on to be a partner in \\ntranslating the words, ideas and initiatives of this week \\ninto concrete action.', '\\nI believe it is fair to say that we have just come \\nthrough an annus horribilis: a year marked by the \\nworldwide financial and economic crisis, the worst \\nsince the Great Depression of 1929; by an increase in \\nhunger and poverty — we are speaking about some \\n100 million more people sinking into hunger and \\nchronic poverty due to the crisis, and more than \\n1 billion people suffering from hunger in 2009; by the \\ndramatic rise in unemployment — the International \\nLabour Organization (ILO) indicates that 50 million \\nworkers are at risk of losing or have already lost their \\njobs; by set-backs in the hard-won progress towards \\nthe Millennium Development Goals; and by the \\noutbreak of a pandemic. It was also a year during \\nwhich questions about the relevance of the United \\nNations and calls for an overhaul of international \\ngovernance grew ever louder. \\n Accordingly, we see the need to take stock and \\ndraw lessons, namely, to review the major challenges \\nthe international community is confronting in terms of \\ndevelopment, human rights and the rule of law, \\npeacekeeping and security, disarmament and \\nnon-proliferation and the fight against climate change. \\nAnd what better forum to discuss these issues than the \\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations? \\n The economic crisis that hit the world a year ago \\nwas even more devastating, as it took place while we \\nwere still struggling to cope with, without having \\novercome them, the food and energy crises, as well as \\nthe acceleration, obviously, of climate change. \\n I have just mentioned the particularly negative \\nimpact of the crisis on the poorest. To face those \\nchallenges, we need concerted action, coherent action, \\nglobal action, a true global partnership for \\ndevelopment, based on the shared responsibilities of \\ndonors and recipients. \\n My country will continue to assume its share of \\nresponsibility by maintaining its efforts in terms of \\nofficial development assistance (ODA). Having spent \\n0.95 per cent of its gross national income on ODA in \\n2008, the Government that was elected in June 2009 \\nhas not only confirmed that it maintains the \\nquantitative target of 1 per cent of its gross national \\nincome, but will also continue to insist on the \\nqualitative improvement of Luxembourg’s cooperation \\nin order to further increase efficiency, all of it in the \\n  \\n \\n09-52470 44 \\n \\ncontext of sustainable development integrating \\neconomic, social and environmental issues. \\n Luxembourg calls on all Member States to make \\nthe necessary efforts to keep all the commitments that \\nwere made together in this forum and that we have \\nreiterated at the Millennium Summit in Monterrey and \\nmore recently in Doha. \\n We must, however, learn the lessons provided by \\nthis multidimensional crisis and contemplate a more \\nsystemic reform of the existing multilateral system, \\nincluding the financial and economic architecture, and \\nadapt it to the current political and socio-economic \\nrealities. \\n As I stated in this forum in June at the \\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, the United \\nNations and its principal organs must be at the centre \\nof such a reflection. The Economic and Social Council, \\nwhich is the central mechanism for coordination and \\nthe principal organ of the United Nations responsible \\nfor economic and social issues, will have a particularly \\nimportant role to play in this regard. \\n Luxembourg, which chairs the Economic and \\nSocial Council this year, has assumed its \\nresponsibilities in that regard and is working towards \\nfull implementation of the various mandates entrusted \\nto the Council by Member States in the framework of \\nthe international Conference. \\n All these actions require a strong multilateral \\nframework based on sound legal rules that are binding \\non all Member States. In times of crisis, unilateral \\ntendencies unfortunately tend to recur. While it is \\nimportant that representatives of the major economies \\nof the world meet to discuss common problems, \\nparticularly the economic and financial crisis we have \\nexperienced in recent months, such forums should not \\nand must not substitute for multilateral structures and \\nexisting intergovernmental mandates. \\n In order to retain the relevance of our multilateral \\nstructures, they must be based on trust and cooperation: \\ntrust between the citizen and the State, trust among \\nStates themselves, whether they are from the North or \\nthe South, rich or poor, and confidence of States in the \\nUnited Nations, which is our common good. \\n It lies in our hands to assume our responsibilities, \\nto overcome our divisions, to move the thinking and \\nthe decision-making forward, and to ensure \\nconsistency. It lies in our hands to undertake the \\nnecessary reform efforts required for a Security \\nCouncil that reflects, at last, the geopolitical realities \\nof today, and which is more representative, efficient \\nand transparent; for a revitalized General Assembly, \\nand for a stronger and more effective Economic and \\nSocial Council. It lies in our hands to demonstrate the \\ncontinued relevance of our Organization and its \\ncapacity to act and to formulate joint responses, global \\nresponses and legitimate responses. \\n In our globalized world, there is no turning away. \\n We are all concerned, and the challenges we are \\nfacing are of an ever-increasing complexity, including \\nin matters of peace and security. Yesterday, we \\ncommemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the United \\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA), an anniversary \\nthat one would somehow have preferred not to have to \\ncelebrate, for while it allowed us to express our \\ngratitude for the outstanding work done by that United \\nNations agency in the service of the Palestinian people \\non a daily basis, it is true, it is also synonymous with \\nfailure. Sixty years later, the situation in the Middle \\nEast remains unresolved. \\n While we welcome that the new Administration \\nin the United States is determined to seek a solution \\nbased on the coexistence of two States and a \\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East, and while we, \\ntogether with our European Union partners, are \\ncommitted to working actively with the United States \\nand other Quartet members, including, obviously, the \\nUnited Nations, to achieve this goal, at the same time \\nwe deeply regret that Israel persists in its policy of \\ncolonization.  \\n Mr. Shaheed (Maldives), Vice-President, took the \\nChair. \\n It cannot be repeated too often: the settlement \\nactivity is not only illegal under international law, but \\nit is also an obstacle to peace. To continue colonization \\nis to persist in humiliating the Palestinians, in \\ndominating the Palestinian people. Without the clear \\nsignal of an end to this policy, it is unlikely that serious \\nnegotiations can resume. \\n We fully support the intention of the President of \\nthe United States to engage in negotiations, and we \\nwill support him in this endeavour. Annapolis showed \\nthat Israelis and Palestinians, when they are alone \\n \\n \\n45 09-52470 \\n \\naround the negotiating table, are not able to show a \\nlevel of commitment commensurate with the \\nfundamental problems, namely, Jerusalem, the question \\nof refugees and their right to return, security and the \\nissue of borders. \\n We call on all parties to shoulder their \\nresponsibilities and, through their actions, to establish \\nan environment conducive to the resumption of \\nnegotiations to resolve the conflict. The end of \\ndivisions among Palestinians and the intra-Palestinian \\nreconciliation that is centred on President Mahmoud \\nAbbas, who has demonstrated in the West Bank that \\nsubstantial progress in terms of security and \\ngovernance is possible, are just as much a part of this \\nas the adoption of confidence-building measures by \\nIsrael and Arab countries or the simultaneous search \\nfor solutions to the conflicts between, on the one hand, \\nIsrael and the Syrian Arab Republic and, on the other \\nhand, Israel and Lebanon. \\n In that context, I would also like to stress just \\nhow urgent it is to find a sustainable solution to the \\ncrisis in Gaza through the full implementation of \\nSecurity Council resolution 1860 (2009). An end must \\nbe put to the untenable situation of 1.5 million \\nPalestinians living in a prison. Giving hope and \\nmotivation to the Palestinian people is a basic human \\nobligation. Light must also be shed on the events in \\nGaza, including the events following the release of the \\nUnited Nations fact-finding mission’s report, which has \\njust been published and which has brought shocking \\nacts to light. The credibility of the United Nations is at \\nstake in this matter. \\n The credibility of the international community \\ntoo is at stake in a number of respects with regard to \\nthe situation in Afghanistan. It is at stake as far as the \\nestablishment and maintenance of peace and security is \\nconcerned, but also in terms of preserving the rule of \\nlaw and respect for our fundamental values, ensuring \\nthe economic and social development of the country \\nand combating poverty. That was the mandate given to \\nthe United Nations back in 2001. It has become clear \\nthat, eight years after the adoption of that mandate, the \\nprogress made is still not enough. In the light of the \\nincreasing number of bloody attacks carried out across \\nthe country, the events surrounding the recent \\npresidential elections and the alarming figures in terms \\nof development objectives, public opinion is beginning \\nto wonder whether in fact we are not moving \\nbackwards. \\n There is no easy solution, but there is certainly no \\nalternative to our continued engagement in the country. \\nI would like to stress that, together with our European \\nUnion and NATO partners, we will remain engaged \\nalongside the authorities and the people of \\nAfghanistan. There can be no question of abandoning \\nthe people, who have been devastated by decades of \\nconflict and violations of their most basic rights. The \\ngoal must be a stable and democratic State where all \\nforces, including the Taliban, recognize and respect the \\nrule of law and basic human rights. \\n Another conflict area that has long been a source \\nof concern and where our hopes of lasting peace were \\nonce again called into question in the past year is the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Once again it is \\ncivilians who must suffer the consequences. We are \\nseriously concerned about the crimes committed \\nagainst civilians, especially women and children. \\n In that context I would like to welcome the draft \\nSecurity Council resolution that provides for concrete \\nfollow-up to resolution 1820 (2008), on women and \\npeace and security. Luxembourg fully supports that \\ntext. I also welcome the personal commitment of the \\nSecretary-General in the fight against sexual violence. \\nIt is important that the United Nations system as a \\nwhole address the phenomenon of sexual violence, \\nwhich is used increasingly as a weapon of war in \\narmed conflict even after hostilities have ended. It is \\nessential to strengthen efforts to prevent such acts from \\nhappening and to bring to justice those who commit \\nthose horrible crimes. \\n While much remains to be said about the \\nchallenges in terms of the maintenance of peace and \\nsecurity, especially in the context of the current debate \\non the future of peacekeeping operations — a debate \\nthat I applaud — allow me to dwell for a moment on \\nthe current encouraging developments in the field of \\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. \\n I welcome President Obama’s initiative to engage \\nthe Security Council in a broader discussion of issues \\npertaining to non-proliferation and disarmament, \\nbeyond the specific area of issues related to sanctions. \\nAs we are only a few months from the eighth Review \\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it is \\nimportant that we demonstrate our determination to \\ncarry out that task as regards the three pillars of the \\n  \\n \\n09-52470 46 \\n \\nNPT, the ultimate goal being a world free of nuclear \\nweapons. \\n The same goes for the Comprehensive Nuclear-\\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the other cornerstone of the \\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. As I said yesterday \\nduring the meeting of States that have ratified the \\nCTBT, the call of the Security Council to sign and \\nratify the CTBT and the commitment of President \\nObama to do everything possible to ensure ratification \\nin the United States are crucial. The Treaty must at last \\nenter into force. We hope that those encouraging \\ndevelopments will lead others to adopt a more \\nconstructive attitude, with full respect for their \\ninternational obligations. \\n Beyond non-proliferation issues, however, we \\nmust not overlook disarmament itself. In that regard, \\nwe certainly welcome the decision of the United States \\nand the Russian Federation to conduct negotiations to \\nconclude a new comprehensive agreement following \\nthe expiry of the START II Treaty next December. \\n Allow me as well to say a few words about an \\nissue that is also relevant in terms of security and \\ndefence. I am referring to the welcome decision — in \\nmy opinion, at least — by the United States \\nAdministration to abandon the effort to put in place a \\nmissile defence shield. It always seemed to me that the \\nway forward in that regard was not to adopt unilateral \\nmeasures, but to engage in discussion and cooperation \\nwith our Russian partners with a view to ensuring our \\ncommon security. \\n I cannot conclude without saying a few words \\nabout climate change, which is perhaps the greatest \\nchallenge to world prosperity in the long term. I would \\nlike to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\\nGeneral once again for convening the summit of \\n22 September. That resulted in political mobilization at \\nthe highest level, which is crucial if we want to make \\nthe Copenhagen Conference a success and set a new \\ncourse towards sustainable development and green \\ngrowth that reduces carbon emissions. \\n The scientific evidence exists. It is now up to us \\nto respond with determination in facing those facts. \\nDeveloped countries will have to set the example by \\nagreeing to ambitious and higher than average targets \\nto reduce carbon dioxide by 2050. They must do so by \\nentering into binding legal commitments, including for \\nthe medium term, in the context of an effective and \\nuniversal international regime to which countries \\ncontribute on the basis of their capacity. \\n Moreover, the issue of adaptation to climate \\nchange — including also the financing of related \\nefforts, which will necessarily constitute an additional \\nexpense — should be treated as a priority at \\nCopenhagen. Allow me to note in passing that the \\ndisarmament efforts that I have just described should \\nfree up financial resources that could be put to better \\nuse in this regard. \\n Meanwhile, together with its partners in the \\nEuropean Union, Luxembourg has already committed \\nitself to reach the so-called 20-20-20 goal of increasing \\nenergy efficiency in the European Union by 20 per \\ncent, increasing renewable energy by 20 per cent of \\ntotal energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas \\nemissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels. \\nBeginning several years ago, Luxembourg began to \\nsystematically incorporate the issue of adaptation to \\nclimate change in its development programmes. \\n Climate change, however, will have an impact not \\nonly on development, but also on the full enjoyment of \\nhuman rights and on the security of countries. I \\ntherefore very much welcome the report produced by \\nthe Secretary-General following the initiative taken in \\nthat regard by Pacific small island developing States, \\nwhich addresses the full scope of the problem. \\n Luxembourg remains firmly convinced of the \\nrelevance of a multilateral approach in which the \\nUnited Nations is at the centre. We will continue to \\nbase our policies and make our contributions with a \\nview to creating a world that is more just, more \\npeaceful and more prosperous, as enshrined in our \\nfounding Charter. It is also because of this passionate \\nmotivation to work towards a strong and effective \\nmultilateralism that Luxembourg, a founding Member \\nof the United Nations, aspires to become, for the first \\ntime, a non-permanent member of the Security Council \\nin 2013-2014. ', 'In \\nspeaking to the General Assembly in France’s name \\ntoday, I am well aware that we all have a historic \\nresponsibility in the current circumstances. \\n In the midst of a financial, economic and social \\ncrisis that has no precedent in the history of the United \\nNations, and faced with the threat a global ecological \\ndisaster, we must now invent a new world where the \\nfollies of yesterday are no longer possible. That is our \\nresponsibility. Now we all know towards what \\ncatastrophes our obstinate attempts to solve the \\nproblems of the twenty-first century with twentieth-\\ncentury ideas and instruments may lead us. No one \\namong us can claim any longer that he did not know. \\nThere is a universal awareness that the path that \\nthe world has taken over the past few decades is a dead \\nend. This awareness is born of sorrow, suffering and \\nfear. We are politically and morally accountable for the \\nsuffering on our planet. Tens of millions of men and \\nwomen have lost their jobs and their homes. A billion \\nhuman beings are suffering from hunger, and hundreds \\nof millions have no access to water, energy or minimal \\nhealth care. \\n To those hundreds of millions of people, we, the \\nheads of State and Government, and no one else, must \\nrestore hope. Those who are paying the price of the \\ncrisis had no role in bringing it about. We owe an \\nanswer to the people who are outraged by the \\nbehaviour of those in the financial world who led us to \\nthe brink of chaos and continue to seek to enrich \\nthemselves indecently. We owe an answer to those who \\nare still dying in absurd wars from another age, while \\nhumankind has so many challenges to face.  \\n France’s answer is unambiguous. Things cannot \\ngo on as they were. We must change. We cannot allow \\nit to start all over again, leading to another disaster \\ntomorrow. After such a strong disavowal of our usual \\nthinking and our deep-rooted prejudices, the task \\nbefore us is precisely the same as that faced by men of \\ngood will who sought here to build a new political, \\neconomic and monetary world order after the Second \\nWorld War. The generation that preceded us was equal \\nto its responsibilities. The question today is: Will we be \\nequal to that same responsibility? \\n The world will change. It cannot be otherwise. \\nThe only question is: Will the world change because \\nwe are able to act with wisdom, intelligence and \\ncourage, or because fresh crises will arise if we are not \\nwise enough to take the path of radical change? \\n The truth is that we have already waited too long \\nto regulate globalization, fight global warming and \\ncurb nuclear proliferation. And I should like solemnly \\nto tell the leaders of Iranian that they would be making \\na tragic mistake in relying on the passive response of \\nthe international community in order to pursue their \\nmilitary nuclear programme.  \\n We have waited too long to re-establish peace in \\nthe Middle East by giving the Palestinian people the \\nState to which they are entitled in the name of law and \\nin the name of justice. And we have waited too long to \\nguarantee the people of Israel the right to live in \\nsecurity, which the tragedies of history have made so \\nnecessary for them. \\n We know what we need to do now: increase the \\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of \\nthe Security Council. I say in the name of France, it is \\nunacceptable that the African continent does not have a \\nsingle permanent member on the Security Council — it \\nis unacceptable because it is unjust. It is unacceptable \\nthat the South American continent, with such a great \\npower as Brazil, or India with its population of one \\nbillion, or Japan or Germany, should be excluded from \\namong the permanent members of the Council. It is \\nunacceptable, and I say here that the legitimacy of the \\nUnited Nations is riding on this reform. Either the \\nUnited Nations reforms and its legitimacy will grow, or \\n  \\n \\n09-52179 46 \\n \\nthe reform fails and then decisions will be taken \\noutside the United Nations.  \\n We must reform the International Monetary Fund \\nand the World Bank; that is indispensable. Voting \\nrights need to be more equitably distributed. The \\nmissions of both the Fund and the Bank need to be \\nredefined. To maintain the Fund as the guardian of an \\northodoxy that has been so severely shaken by the \\ncrisis would be a tragic mistake.  \\n The international system has to be reformed. We \\ncannot have a politically multipolar world with a single \\ncurrency. That is not acceptable; it is not possible. We \\nhave to re-engineer the financial capitalism system. If \\nwe have a system in which the real price of risk or the \\nreal price of rare resources is not being paid, that is a \\nsuicidal system.  \\n We need to eliminate tax havens, for we must not \\ntolerate places where money derived from speculation, \\ncrime and fraud is stashed. It is up to us. No one in the \\nworld would understand if we were to fail to live up to \\nthis objective.  \\n We need to curb the price swings of commodities \\nthat are subject to excessive speculation, starting with \\noil, since this instability is unsustainable. The countries \\nthat have commodities must be paid a fair price for \\ntheir resources. We must not accept the speculation that \\ndestabilizes the world over the costs of commodities. \\n In Copenhagen, we need to commit to \\nquantitative targets for greenhouse gas emissions. We \\ncan no longer put off the moment of choice. We need to \\nset up a world environment organization. We need to \\nacknowledge the legitimacy of the principle of a \\ncarbon tax border adjustment mechanism so that \\nnobody can profit from environmental dumping.  \\n We cannot let the law of trade be the only law. I \\nbelieve in free trade, but there are fundamental \\nstandards. We are members of the World Health \\nOrganization. How can we impair the right to health of \\nthose who have nothing? We are members of the \\nInternational Labour Organization, which has defined \\nthe fundamental standards in this field. How can we \\naccept that those standards be flouted? The right to \\nhealth, the right to a minimum respect for one’s social \\nrights and the right to protection of the planet are just \\nas important as the right to trade. There is no single \\nright that is more important than the others. \\n We cannot ask developing countries and poor \\ncountries to comply with these standards if we, the \\nrich, do not help them in their efforts. We all belong to \\nthe same human race. We all live on the same planet. \\nWe are all facing the same challenges.  \\n So yes, we need to be able to share our \\ntechnology. France is ready to do so, and so are the \\nother wealthy countries of the world. Yes, we will need \\nto come up with further resources for development \\nassistance and for meeting the ecological challenge \\ntogether. I do not hesitate to say that we will find these \\nresources by taxing excessive gains from speculation \\nand profits. We do not have to look far for resources; \\nthey are right there. I would like to appeal to all States, \\nto all international organizations, that the \\nrecommendations made by the commission chaired by \\nJoseph Stiglitz be disseminated broadly. Let us make \\nno mistake about the way we measure economic \\ngrowth.  \\n The task is a huge one, and it is only just \\nbeginning. That is all the more reason for starting now \\nand starting quickly. We have little time remaining. \\nEach of us needs to realize what would happen if we \\nhad to go home and explain to our fellow citizens that \\nwe have been incapable of reaching an agreement, of \\nfinding new solutions at a time when they are suffering \\nso grievously from the consequences of the crisis. I \\nwish to say very clearly that nothing would be worse \\nthat a mediocre compromise in Pittsburgh and in \\nCopenhagen. World opinion and the current \\ncircumstances demand that we find a real solution to \\nthe problems and not just to pretend. \\n If we do nothing, the threat of the worst crisis is \\nnot behind us but ahead of us. We are at one of those \\nmoments in history when political decisions will have \\na profound and lasting impact on the future. We have \\nno choice; we must take risks, since the greatest risk \\ntoday would be to do nothing, to let ourselves be \\ncarried along by the force of habit, to think that we still \\nhave time. France has come to tell you that we have no \\nmore time.  \\n I hope that this year, 2009, is when a new world \\norder — a more fair, more efficient world order — will \\nbe established, one that each of us will be comfortable \\nwith.', '\\nNothing is created without men; nothing lasts without \\ninstitutions. Those words of Jean Monnet, one of the \\nfounders of the European Union, remain as true as \\never. Security, climate change and some effects of \\nglobalization are challenges that all our countries face. \\nThat is why a global approach, with the United Nations \\nplaying a central role, is needed. But the United \\nNations must earn that central role. As President \\nBarack Obama said here (see ), we cannot \\ncomplain, on the one hand, about the so-called \\nunilateral action of the United States while at the same \\ntime expecting it alone to solve all the world’s \\nproblems.  \\n In that spirit I would call for a new multilateral \\ncommitment, as the reform of international institutions \\nis crucial in order to enhance their legitimacy, \\nrepresentativeness and capacity for action. Nothing is \\ncreated without men; nothing lasts without institutions. \\nFrom now on, those institutions should work \\nefficiently, starting with the United Nations. It is \\nessential to move ahead rapidly on the reform of the \\nSecurity Council and of the functioning of the General \\nAssembly. \\n Indeed, there is an urgent need to improve the \\nefficiency of our own operations. A glance at the \\norganizational chart of the United Nations allows us to \\nsee not only the overlaps but also the gaps in the \\nsystem. It is out of commitment to the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations that Belgium, one of the founding \\nMembers, strongly appeals for more rigour and \\ntransparency in the management and budget of the \\nUnited Nations in order to better use its limited \\nresources.  \\n In addition to the fragmentation of the United \\nNations system, two other trends reveal the need for \\nenhanced multilateral commitment. The first is the \\nmultitude of regional and subregional organizations \\nalmost everywhere in the world. It is true that this \\nmultitude enhances international cooperation, but \\nregional and international organizations sometimes \\nlack harmonization. Better cooperation should \\nhenceforth allow the optimal use of the resources of \\nall. \\n The second trend can be summed up by the words \\n“imperfect multilateralism”. Countries get together on \\nan informal basis to discuss international issues, for \\nexample — and this is very pertinent — the economic \\nand financial crisis. These informal groups may, \\nparticularly at first, expedite the decision-making of \\ninternational multilateral organizations, but they cannot \\nreplace those organizations themselves because \\nmultilateralism cannot be exclusive. Rather, it should \\n  \\n \\n09-52592 26 \\n \\nbe inclusive and transparent. Nothing can last without \\ninstitutions, but even the best organized institutions \\ncannot function in the absence of inspiration and \\nhuman will. Even the best organized institutions are \\npowerless when men prevent them from working.  \\n The economic and financial crisis has been given \\na great deal of attention, which is only natural. The \\ncrisis most severely affects developing countries. It is \\nnow more important than ever that donor countries \\nmeet their official development assistance objectives of \\n0.7 per cent of the gross national product. Belgium \\nplans to achieve that goal in 2010. \\n The worst international disorder is violence \\nbetween States and within States. Within some States, \\nviolence continues to kill, maim and rape millions of \\npeople. The worst international disorder is reflected in \\nthe wars, civil conflicts, inter-ethnic fighting and harsh \\nrepression that deprive millions of people of a decent \\nexistence. This is our first and foremost challenge \\nbecause without peace and security there is no \\ndevelopment, let alone sustainable development. \\nWithout peace and security, there can be no fair \\ndistribution of the wealth of our Earth. \\n As stipulated in the preamble of the Constitution \\nof UNESCO,  \\n “since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the \\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be \\nconstructed”. \\nIndeed, conflict prevention begins with the banishment \\nof all hate speech attacking the dignity of human \\nbeings, nations and communities, or the right of States \\nto exist. Far too often, we have witnessed bloodbaths \\nprovoked by incitement to hatred. Such speech has no \\nplace in this Hall or in this Organization, whose \\nprimary mission is precisely to promote peace and \\nsecurity through constructive cooperation. \\n To function efficiently, our multilateral \\ninstitutions need leaders and representatives of States \\nwho share basic approaches established on the core \\nbelief in the unique dignity of each human being. \\nNational sovereignty implies responsibility. That is \\nwhy Belgium wholeheartedly supports the principle of \\nthe responsibility to protect. The principle requires \\nGovernments to safeguard their citizens against \\ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \\nagainst humanity. Incidentally, Belgium would like to \\nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his excellent \\nreport on this topic (A/63/677) and fully supports his \\nefforts in this area. \\n It is civilians, and women and children in \\nparticular, who are often the primary victims of \\nviolence and of indescribable and unacceptable \\nsuffering. Indeed, women constitute half of the world’s \\npopulation, but too often we forget that human rights \\nalso fully apply to them. In situations of war and \\nviolence, women are frequently twofold victims \\nbecause of the sexual violence inflicted upon them. My \\ncountry is therefore determined to pursue its action \\nagainst sexual violence and any kind of violence \\nagainst children. \\n Wars are caused by men, not by weapons. \\nNonetheless, the arms control issue has to be high on \\nthe international agenda. That is why Belgium \\nwelcomes the meeting of the Security Council at the \\nhighest level on the subject of non-proliferation and \\nnuclear disarmament (S/PV.6191). That meeting was \\nundoubtedly a highlight of this week. Resolution \\n1887 (2009), adopted yesterday, represents, in our \\nopinion, a milestone for a world free of weapons of \\nmass destruction. \\n However, unfortunately, the latest news from Iran \\nseems to be heading in the opposite direction. My \\ncountry therefore endorses the very urgent call on Iran \\nand North Korea to cooperate with the international \\ncommunity and respect the Security Council \\nresolutions that pertain to them. If they do not, they \\nwill be ostracized by the international community. \\n At the same time, the fight against the \\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction should \\nnot make us overlook conventional weapons, which \\ncurrently kill on a massive scale. In particular, I refer \\nhere to anti-personnel landmines. The Convention that \\nprohibits these weapons entered into force in 1999, and \\nBelgium hopes that it will be strengthened at the \\nReview Conference scheduled to take place in \\nCartagena, Colombia, in early December. With respect \\nto that Convention, Belgium, along with Thailand, will \\nhead the Standing Committee on Victim Assistance and \\nSocio-Economic Reintegration. Furthermore, Belgium \\nhas spared no effort to push for the conclusion of the \\nConvention on Cluster Munitions. \\n Human rights in all their aspects are a major \\nconcern for Belgium. That is why my country plays an \\nactive role as a member of the Human Rights Council. \\nIn that regard, I would like to thank the members of the \\n \\n \\n27 09-52592 \\n \\nCouncil that entrusted my country, Belgium, with the \\nresponsibility and honour to preside over that \\nimportant institution. That trust is, in my view, a \\nrecognition of our commitment. \\n Finally, human rights also concern the rights of \\nfuture generations. We do not own this Earth; we have \\nit on loan from our children. Today more than ever, \\nthat heritage is threatened, and that is why \\nenvironmental protection should be our main shared \\nconcern and priority. The Climate Change Conference \\nscheduled for late 2009 in Copenhagen is an \\nopportunity that cannot be squandered. We need to \\nmake specific and binding commitments there. I \\nbelieve that the European Union has shown the way \\nwith its ambitious package of measures adopted in late \\n2008. \\n Institutions cannot function without the input of \\nmen. Therefore, those who undermine the performance \\nof these institutions should be held accountable. That is \\nwhy Belgium has been particularly active in the fight \\nagainst impunity. An international legal order is \\nrequired, but it can function only if it is upheld by \\nStates governed by the rule of law. I therefore reaffirm \\nthe need for common positions that are essential for a \\nworld that is safer, fairer and more prosperous. In the \\nwords of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan,  \\n “There is no long-term security without \\ndevelopment. There is no development without \\nsecurity. And no society can long remain secure, \\nor prosperous, without respect for human rights \\nand the rule of law.” (Press release \\nSG/SM/10425) \\nStrengthening the rule of law at the national and \\ninternational levels is more vital than ever for \\nachieving a more equitable form of globalization. \\n I will conclude with these words. Peace and \\nsecurity, sustainable development, and a fair \\ndistribution of the wealth of the Earth are the essential, \\nglobal challenges that we face. To meet these \\nchallenges, we need solid international institutions, but \\ninstitutional multilateralism is not enough. We also \\nneed a multilateralism of minds, and men and women \\nof conviction to carry it forward.  \\n This will, belief and ambition motivate my \\ncountry, a founding Member of the United Nations, to \\noffer the candidacy for the presidency of the General \\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session of our compatriot \\nLouis Michel, former Minister for Foreign affairs of \\nBelgium and former European Commissioner in charge \\nof Development and Humanitarian Aid. We are \\nconvinced that the strength of his conviction and \\ndedication will unite us further. It is indeed only when \\nthe men and women who take the floor here are fired \\nby a shared vision of human rights, peace and \\ndevelopment that our institutions will be able to deliver \\nwhat we need: collective results rather than individual \\nachievements.', 'A few weeks \\nago, the Empire State Building was lit up in orange, the \\nnational colour of the Netherlands. The reason was \\nthat, precisely 400 years ago, the Dutch East India \\nCompany commissioned Henry Hudson to find a \\nshorter sea route to Asia via the north. After a brutal \\nvoyage filled with hardships, Hudson decided to \\nchange course. He never found his shortcut to Asia, but \\nhe did become the first person to map the area around \\nthe river that would one day bear his name, including \\nthe place where we are gathered today. Ever since then, \\nthe origin of the great city of New York has been \\nclosely linked with the courage and resolve of Henry \\nHudson. Today more than ever before, we must make \\nthose qualities our own.  \\n In the past year, we have faced the harsh reality \\nof a financial and economic system on the brink. The \\ncrisis has been so severe and so rapid that courage and \\nresolve are now required of us all — the courage to \\nplace shared values and interests above narrow self-\\ninterest, the resolve to adapt existing global \\ngovernance structures to a new reality and the courage \\nto make decisive choices that take account of all \\ninterests, especially those of the world’s weakest and \\npoorest people. That is my clear message to the \\nGeneral Assembly. \\n The Dutch Government has no doubt that a \\nstrong, decisive and efficient United Nations will be \\nvital to that process. Only an integrated global \\napproach will deliver the stability, solidarity and \\nsustainability that the world needs so badly. The last \\nfew days in New York and Pittsburgh have shown that \\nthere is a clear realization that the world has changed \\nand that we must work together more closely than ever \\nbefore. Our interdependency gives us a shared \\nresponsibility. We can see now that the problems we \\nface are too big for any single nation.  \\n There is therefore strong will to address the \\nunderlying causes of the economic crisis, to work on \\nsystemic imbalances and to once again make finance a \\ntool for growth. The agreement we reached in \\nPittsburgh on a framework for strong, sustainable and \\nbalanced growth is a big step forward. It shows that \\nthere is a widely shared conviction that we have much \\nto gain from stability, solidarity and sustainability, both \\nas individual countries and collectively. I would like to \\nsay a few words about each of those core concepts. \\n \\n \\n9 09-52586 \\n \\n The current crisis offers clear proof that in a \\nglobalized world instability anywhere is a threat to \\nstability everywhere. The international policy response \\nhas shown that that is widely understood in the \\nfinancial and economic context. That is a positive sign, \\neven if there is still a long way to go. The Pittsburgh \\nagreement on compensation systems should end a \\nbonus culture that has grown out of control. We cannot \\nallow the greed of a few to endanger the jobs of many. \\nWe must therefore prevent that kind of crisis from ever \\nhappening again. \\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \\nVenezuela), Vice-President, took the Chair. \\n Institutional reform should not stop with the \\nfinancial and economic sector. There is a clear need for \\nnew arrangements that will allow us to manage a range \\nof global governance issues at the same time. In the \\nlong term, the greatest threat to a stable world order is \\nto allow the crisis to push the world’s other great \\nproblems into the background: climate change, for \\nexample, the energy and food crisis or the pressing \\nissues of peace and security, poverty and human rights. \\nWe cannot let that happen. In some cases, we simply \\nhave to honour commitments that we have already \\nmade, such as the Millennium Development Goals. In \\nothers, we need the courage to see beyond this crisis to \\nthe world of tomorrow, as we must show at the climate \\nsummit to be held in Copenhagen.  \\n In any event, the current situation demands that \\nwe place our common global values and interests \\nabove our acute domestic problems, however serious \\nthey may be. Therefore, now more than ever, we need a \\nstrong, decisive and efficient United Nations. We need \\nit here in New York, but we especially need it on the \\nground. In that context, I would highlight the vital \\nimportance of the One United Nations Initiative, which \\nneeds follow-up, and soon. \\n Stability cannot be achieved without respect for \\nhuman rights. As friends of the Iranian people, we are \\nconcerned about the worsening human rights situation \\nand the violent crackdown on popular protests. The \\nIranian nuclear issue represents a major challenge to \\ninternational peace and security, to regional stability \\nand to the non-proliferation regime. The recent \\nrevelation of a nuclear facility that was long kept secret \\nis additional reason for great concern. It calls for a \\nstrong reaction by the international community and for \\ntotal transparency by Iran. Iran must regain the trust of \\nthe international community, comply with relevant \\nSecurity Council resolutions and contribute to peace \\nand stability in the Middle East. \\n In June of this year, the United Nations showed \\nleadership by holding a major conference here in New \\nYork on the effects of the crisis for developing \\ncountries. The Netherlands fully supported that \\ninitiative, as there can be no stability without \\nsolidarity. After all, there is nothing more destabilizing \\nthan poverty, hunger and a future without hope. The \\neconomic crisis and rising food prices are threatening \\nto sweep away a great deal of hard-won progress. In \\n2009 alone, the number of people forced to live on less \\nthan $1.25 a day will grow by at least 55 million. \\n There is a real danger that those who had no part \\nin causing the crisis will be the people who suffer most \\ndeeply. In rich countries the crisis means the loss of \\njobs and assets. In developing countries it means rising \\nchild mortality and rising hunger. Therefore, in rich \\ncountries the crisis is serious; in poor countries it is a \\nmatter of life and death. \\n Let the donor countries honour an old promise \\nand set aside at least 0.7 per cent of their national \\nincome every year for development aid; and let the \\ncurrent crisis also inspire recipient countries to use the \\nfunds as effectively as possible. Now more than ever, \\npublic support for development aid depends on \\ntransparency, good governance and an effective fight \\nagainst corruption.  \\n I would also add that international solidarity is \\nnot simply a question of development budgets. It also \\nconcerns the private sector. More and more businesses \\nnow recognize the importance of corporate social \\nresponsibility. I believe there is still a world to be won \\nin that regard, not only for society but also for \\ncompanies themselves. Corporate social responsibility \\nmakes good business sense. \\n My third subject, sustainability, is essentially \\nabout making choices and sacrifices, not for our own \\nsake but for future generations. This session of the \\nGeneral Assembly is our last major stop on the road to \\nCopenhagen. We should be aware that the progress we \\nmake there will affect the lives of our children, our \\nchildren’s children and so on, down through the \\ngenerations. That must be our main motive for seeking \\na radical change in the way we live. \\n  \\n \\n09-52586 10 \\n \\n In Copenhagen we must reach an ambitious, fair \\nand comprehensive agreement. We must be ambitious \\nand set our sights high. Therefore, at Copenhagen the \\nNetherlands will call for worldwide carbon dioxide \\nemissions to be halved from 1990 levels by 2050. We \\nshould be fair to developing countries. Every country \\nshould contribute to the common goal according to its \\nmeans. Every country will be expected to play its part. \\nBut those that need help in designing and \\nimplementing sound adaptation policies must receive \\nit. That is why the Netherlands has set aside \\n€500 million to promote the use of renewable energy in \\ndeveloping countries. \\n Comprehensive also means that we should not \\nsimply pave the road ahead with good intentions, but \\nwith concrete agreements — for example, agreements \\non developing the global carbon market, on sharing \\nknowledge and on financial arrangements. We simply \\ncannot fail at Copenhagen.  \\n The world is much smaller than it was in the days \\nof Henry Hudson, but it is far more complex as a \\nresult. Any solution to the issues I have raised today \\nstarts with recognizing our mutual dependence and \\nresponsibility. Within the concepts of stability, \\nsolidarity and sustainability we will find the shared \\nvalues and interests that should guide us on the road \\nahead. It is a road that requires courage. But to echo \\nthe words I heard recently from the Italian Nobel Prize \\nwinner and senator for life Rita Levi-Montalcini, on \\nher one-hundredth birthday, “Don’t fear difficult \\nmoments. The best comes from them.” Let us go \\nforward in that spirit.', 'In these tumultuous \\ntimes marked by manifold crises, we are more than \\never in need of a global Organization that all Members \\nmake use of and support. We need the United Nations. \\nThe comprehensive, universal system of the United \\nNations forms the heart of the global system of crisis \\nprevention and mitigation. Now more than ever, \\nGermany pledges its active and extensive support to \\nthis world Organization. \\n This past year taught us bitter lessons, and today \\nit seems clearer than ever: we must secure the \\nsustainability of the economic recovery. That applies \\nnot only to the financial sector, but also, and in \\nparticular, to the most vulnerable in the world — the \\npoorest of the poor in the developing countries — as \\nwell as to our environment and the world’s climate. \\n The consultations on a charter for sustainable \\neconomic activity point in the right direction. The \\nUnited Nations should be actively involved in that \\nprocess. We must turn the crisis into an opportunity for \\ndevelopment and a truly green recovery. \\n The aftermath of the financial crisis is \\njeopardizing our progress on the path towards \\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \\nTherefore, we must do our utmost to avoid any \\nsetbacks in that regard. Donor States must continue \\ntheir efforts for development, all the more so in times \\nof crisis. Germany has continually increased its official \\ndevelopment assistance contributions in recent years. \\nIn 2008, my country was the second-largest donor of \\nofficial development assistance. We will also \\nsignificantly increase our contributions to the \\nmultilateral development banks. \\n All of this underscores one thing: Germany, as \\none of the world’s largest economies, stands by its \\nglobal responsibility. But developing countries must \\nalso live up to their responsibilities. Responsible \\ngovernance, respect for human rights, environmental \\nprotection, the fight against epidemics, the \\nstrengthening of the rights of women — those are the \\nchallenges that each country has the responsibility to \\nmeet. \\n Climate change is the pre-eminent challenge of \\nthe twenty-first century. It threatens our well-being, \\nour security and our economic development. It will \\nlead to uncontrollable risks and dramatic damage, if we \\ndo not take resolute action — not in some distant \\nfuture, but right now. \\n I can assure the Assembly: Germany will \\ncontinue to be a leader in climate protection. But we \\nwill be successful only if we act together. We need an \\ninclusive process in which those countries directly \\naffected by climate change, such as the small island \\nStates, can also play a part. The United Nations is the \\nonly reliable framework for this. I would like to thank \\nthe Secretary-General for his very timely initiative in \\nconvening a United Nations summit last week \\naddressing this key issue. \\n Disarmament and arms control can help create \\nbetter conditions for global cooperation and increase \\nsecurity and stability. We warmly welcome the new \\ndynamic in the area of nuclear disarmament. The call \\nfor a nuclear-weapon-free world enjoys widespread \\nsupport, including that of Germany. We must seize this \\nopportunity for progress in all areas of disarmament. \\nGermany has underlined that sub-strategic nuclear \\nweapons must also be incorporated into the continuing \\nprocess of disarmament. Our clear commitment to \\nridding the world of all nuclear weapons is the best \\nway to strengthen the international non-proliferation \\nregime. \\n We need a new international consensus at the \\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the \\nlaunching of negotiations in Geneva on a fissile \\nmaterial cut-off treaty and the entry into force of the \\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In order to \\navoid a conflict of objectives between \\nnon-proliferation and peaceful uses, Germany supports \\nmultilateral solutions to nuclear-fuel supply and has \\nput forward its own proposal on that issue. \\n The international community must not relent in \\nits commitment to banning all weapons of mass \\ndestruction. A model in that respect is the Chemical \\nWeapons Convention, which outlaws a whole category \\nof weapons of mass destruction. Its implementing \\norganization needs strong and dynamic leadership. \\nGermany has always had a particular commitment to \\n \\n \\n55 09-52604 \\n \\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, and we stand ready \\nto accept greater responsibility in that organization. \\n We view the ongoing nuclear programme in Iran \\nwith great concern. The belated admittance by Iran \\nconcerning the construction of a second enrichment \\nplant underlines the fact that our concerns are more \\nthan justified. Even before this latest event, the report \\nby International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \\nDirector-General El Baradei emphasized the urgency of \\nthe matter. Unfortunately, the Iranian Government still \\nrefuses to cooperate fully with the IAEA and to remove \\nserious doubts concerning the peaceful character of its \\nnuclear programme. We urge Iran to grant an IAEA \\nverification team access to the newly disclosed site \\nwithout delay. \\n We sincerely hope that Iran will use the \\nopportunity of the upcoming talks between it and the \\nE3+3 — the United Kingdom, France and Germany, \\nplus the United States, the Russian Federation and \\nChina — to demonstrate its willingness to engage in \\nhonest and speedy negotiations. If Iran’s leaders \\ncontinue to stall, the international community will have \\nno other choice but to take additional measures to \\nemphasize the seriousness of our common concern. \\n Iran has a long and great history. It witnessed the \\norigins of civilization. It can become an anchor of \\nstability in its region — a respected member of the \\ninternational community. But that involves, in addition \\nto a diplomatic resolution of questions regarding its \\nnuclear programme, a responsible foreign policy \\ntowards its neighbours. The key to this is the \\nrecognition of Israel’s right to exist. \\n Since the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip \\nat the beginning of the year, we have seen some \\nencouraging signs of a return to the peace process. The \\nresumption of negotiations aimed at the two-State \\nsolution is still possible. Germany strongly supports \\nPresident Obama’s intensive commitment and regional \\napproach. Together with the partners of the European \\nUnion, we are prepared to support efforts towards \\npeace through concrete contributions. What we now \\nneed, however, are courageous gestures of goodwill on \\nall sides to create the conditions for serious talks. \\n The successful holding of elections in June was \\nan important milestone towards the continuing \\nstabilization of Lebanon. What is now important is that \\na new Government soon be formed. The successful \\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) \\nmission remains a crucial contribution to securing the \\nceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, and thus to the \\nstabilization of the region. By again assuming \\ncommand of the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force on \\n1 September, we further strengthened our commitment \\nto UNIFIL. \\n For Afghanistan, 2009 is a pivotal year. The \\npresidential elections — the first elections in decades \\nthat were free and organized by the Afghans \\nthemselves — determined who will control the fate of \\nthe country over the next five years. They were an \\nimpressive sign of the resolve of the people of \\nAfghanistan to take part in the political process. \\n Against the backdrop of the difficult security \\nsituation, the further build-up of Afghan security forces \\nassumes even greater importance. We will, therefore, \\ncontinue to increase the number of German police \\ninstructors in Afghanistan, we will support the further \\nbuild-up of the European Union Police Mission, and \\nwe will help to advance the training of the Afghan \\narmy within the framework of the International \\nSecurity Assistance Force. \\n Despite all the criticism, there are also \\nencouraging accomplishments, especially in the field \\nof economic growth and in the reconstruction of the \\ncountry’s infrastructure. The basic prerequisites for \\nAfghanistan’s sustainable development are good \\ngovernance, a resolute fight against corruption and an \\nimprovement in State services. These are essential if \\nthe population is to once again nurture hope for the \\nfuture. As one of the largest troop-contributing nations \\nand one of the main bilateral donors, Germany will \\ncontinue to play an instrumental role in the \\nreconstruction of the country. \\n Following the presidential elections, we are now \\nentering a new phase of cooperation between the \\ninternational community and Afghanistan. For that \\nreason, Germany, together with the United Kingdom \\nand France, has taken the initiative to hold an \\ninternational conference that will set out concrete, \\nrealistic and measurable goals for the future political \\nand economic development of Afghanistan. To that \\nend, the Afghanistan Compact, which will expire in \\n2010, should be further developed. \\n In 2010, we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary \\nof the independence of no fewer than 17 African \\nStates — a fitting moment to also look to the future. \\nDespite the global economic crisis, the overall outlook \\n  \\n \\n09-52604 56 \\n \\nfor Africa and its people is positive. We must succeed \\nin utilizing the continent’s enormous potential in terms \\nof people, creativity and resources. It remains our \\nchallenge to support the development of that potential \\nwhile, at the same time, respecting African ownership. \\n African ownership should by no means be \\nequated with a withdrawal from our neighbouring \\ncontinent. On the contrary, it means that we should \\ncultivate relations with the States of Africa in a spirit \\nof partnership — a partnership in which each side \\nintroduces its ideas, and in which we work together to \\nmaster the challenges we face, whether locally or \\nglobally. \\n One major common challenge remains the \\ncontainment of violence and the protection of people in \\nconflict areas. Germany will continue its extensive \\nengagement in Africa, be it in the area of development \\ncooperation, peace and security, business and \\ntechnology, the environmental and energy sector or \\neducational and scientific cooperation. This also \\napplies to cooperation with the African Union, which \\nhas been expanding increasingly in recent years. \\n United Nations peacekeeping missions are a \\ncentral pillar of the international security architecture. \\nReform of United Nations peacekeeping is an urgent \\nissue, and Germany is ready to actively contribute to \\nsuch reform. \\n It is absolutely essential that the cooperation \\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \\nbe further intensified. The European Union has just \\nshown that, with its peacekeeping missions in \\nAfrica — those in the Democratic Republic of the \\nCongo and Chad, to name just two examples — it is a \\nreliable partner of the United Nations when it comes to \\ncrisis management. \\n We are facing a multitude of global challenges. \\nToday, no country is strong enough to tackle those \\nchallenges on its own. We need a universal forum for \\njoint global action. That is why we need a strong \\nUnited Nations that is capable of taking effective \\naction. \\n A long chain of high-level meetings — from the \\n2005 High-level Event to the Secretary-General’s \\nSummit on Climate Change last week — has \\nemphasized how urgent it is to adapt the United \\nNations to the challenges of today’s world, for threats \\nhave become global. Our responses, however, are still \\nnot always global, and that is true for the United \\nNations as well. \\n Reforms must start with simple questions. Does a \\nparticular body effectively fulfil its tasks? Does its \\ncomposition reflect the world of today? Where that is \\nnot the case, reform must have a clear objective: to \\nmake the United Nations more effective, more credible \\nand more assertive. \\n However, we must not limit reforms to the United \\nNations. If we want to deal effectively with the current \\ncrisis and effectively prevent future crises, we must \\nalso reform the international financial institutions. \\nIsolated reforms of individual institutions will not get \\nus anywhere. Reform of the financial institutions and \\nof the United Nations must intermesh as a broader \\nreform of global governance — a reform that, more \\nthan six decades after the founding of today’s world \\norder, is long overdue. Germany, incidentally, is \\nadvocating at a high level the improved representation \\nof newly industrialized and developing countries as \\npart of the reform of the international financial \\ninstitutions. This is our understanding of global \\ngovernance: fair participation for everybody. \\n In 2000 and 2005, heads of State and Government \\ncalled for reform of the Security Council. They did so \\nout of the realization that we can meet the threats of \\ntoday only if the Council reflects the world of today. \\nOne thing is clear: if the Security Council does not \\nreform itself, there is a risk that other bodies will \\nattempt to take its place. Such a rivalry would be \\ndetrimental to us all. Let us therefore attempt, at this \\nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, to bring \\nabout concrete results. \\n Germany has been and remains willing to take \\nresponsibility. That includes assuming a permanent \\nseat on a reformed Security Council. We also underline \\nthis readiness to take responsibility with our candidacy \\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period \\n2011-2012. Through our work in the Security Council, \\nwe want to contribute to the success of the United \\nNations, just as we are already contributing to \\nworldwide United Nations missions, to development \\nfunds, humanitarian aid and the United Nations \\nEnvironment Programme. Now and in the future, we \\nwill work to find common interests, to overcome \\ndivisions and to strengthen a global partnership of \\nresponsibility.', 'We look back \\non a year that has been exceptional in so many \\nrespects. Twelve months ago, a bank only a few \\nhundred metres away from here collapsed and brought \\nthe global financial system to the verge of breakdown. \\nThe ensuing turbulence in the finance sector led to a \\nsevere global economic downturn. \\n This illustrates the interconnectedness of our \\nworld. It reminds us that other issues, such as climate \\nchange, the food crisis, migration, pandemics, \\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass \\ndestruction are not confined by national borders. \\nRising to these global challenges requires determined \\nand coordinated action at the national, regional and \\ninternational levels. International cooperation has \\nbecome vital. The United Nations is the place where \\nthis cooperation happens. Today, the world needs the \\nUnited Nations more than ever. \\n The United Nations should continue along its \\npath of reform in order to reinforce its legitimacy. At \\nthe same time, exchanges between the United Nations \\nand other forums such as the Group of 20 (G-20) — \\nwhich is meeting today — must be strengthened. The \\nG-20 has taken over a role in discussing important \\nglobal issues. This development must not take place at \\nthe expense of other nations or global institutions such \\nas the United Nations. The G-20 lacks legitimacy; \\nbasic considerations of due process are absent in the \\nsanctions procedures. The members of the G-20 \\nthemselves are not subject to the same scrutiny. \\nSwitzerland advocates a level playing field. \\n The financial and economic crisis continues to be \\nof concern to all of us. Governments and central banks \\nhave put together vast stabilization packages. However, \\nquantity is not everything. What counts is quality. \\nEconomic activity must revert to fundamental values \\nand virtues. It must focus on economic, social and \\nenvironmental sustainability. Through institutions such \\nas the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank \\nand the United Nations Development Programme \\n(UNDP), the United Nations has the knowledge and the \\ninstruments needed to combat the financial and \\neconomic crisis. It is important to ensure that the \\nvoices of these institutions too be heard within the \\nG-20. \\n The present crisis has occasionally been used in \\nsome quarters as an opportunity to question the market \\neconomy and, indeed, globalization. I do not dispute \\nthat reform is necessary. The failures and abuses have \\nbeen too big to ignore. Nevertheless, we must remind \\nourselves that it is also thanks to a liberal economic \\norder and open markets that much of the world’s \\npopulation has been lifted out of poverty. Here, we \\nshare the concerns of those who believe that the current \\ngrowing trend towards protectionism will lead us \\nstraight towards disaster. My country therefore \\nwelcomes the call made at the United Nations World \\nConference on the Financial and Economic Crisis for \\nthe swift conclusion of the Doha Round. \\n People in the developing countries have been hit \\nparticularly hard by the financial and economic crisis. \\nThere is a significant risk that the achievement of the \\nMillennium Development Goals will be delayed. As for \\n \\n \\n09-52320 24 \\n \\nSwitzerland, we have pledged to maintain our level of \\ndevelopment aid despite stringent budget constraints. \\nDeveloping and developed countries are jointly \\nresponsible for achieving the Millennium Development \\nGoals. Next year, the United Nations conference \\nmarking the tenth anniversary of the Millennium \\nDeclaration will provide us with the opportunity to \\nreinvigorate this partnership and to improve the \\neffectiveness of development aid. \\n Sustainable development must also be our \\nguiding principle in the fight against climate change. \\nThis is why the climate conference in Copenhagen \\nmust be a success. Switzerland wants and is able to set \\na good example. We will achieve our CO2 reduction \\ntargets for 2012. For the period until 2020, we are \\nprepared to cut our CO2 emissions by 20 per cent. At \\nthe global level, the costs of adaptation to climate \\nchange will amount to several tens of billions of \\ndollars per year of which more than half will be at the \\nexpense of developing countries. Switzerland has \\ntherefore proposed the creation of a global carbon tax \\nwhich is based on the polluter-pays principle, in order \\nto deal with these emerging needs. \\n Violent conflicts continue to plague the planet, \\nrendering a life in dignity, peace and security elusive \\nfor too many people. The unique legitimacy of the \\nUnited Nations allows it to play an active role in \\nconflict prevention, mediation, the protection of \\ncivilians, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. My country \\nwelcomes the greater involvement of the United \\nNations in these areas and especially advocates the \\nstrengthening of United Nations prevention and \\nmediation capacities. Switzerland is also active in the \\narea of peacebuilding. It has taken over the \\nchairmanship of the Peacebuilding Commission’s \\ncountry-specific configuration on Burundi and will \\ncontinue its initiative on armed violence and \\ndevelopment. \\n This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \\nthe Geneva Conventions. Since their creation, the \\nGeneva Conventions have set indispensable rules for \\nsituations of armed conflict. New forms of armed \\nconflict and new means and methods of warfare make \\nit increasingly difficult to ensure respect for these \\nrules. It is unacceptable that civilian populations \\nshould be so often the target of deliberate attacks and \\nthat humanitarian aid personnel should be so often \\ndenied rapid and unimpeded access to populations in \\nneed.  \\n In an effort to identify ways of improving \\ncompliance with the Geneva Conventions, Switzerland \\nis organizing a ministerial side event on Saturday here \\nin New York. In November we will hold an \\ninternational conference of experts in Geneva, open to \\nall State parties to the Geneva Conventions. The \\nconference will focus on the current and future \\nchallenges faced by international humanitarian law. \\n Human dignity is an inalienable right of all \\nhuman beings, regardless of their gender, origin or \\nreligion. The Human Rights Council is the principal \\nforum for discussing human rights within the United \\nNations. Both its special procedures and its universal \\nperiodic review process have demonstrated their \\neffectiveness. This said, a great many challenges \\nremain. Switzerland will continue to work vigorously \\nfor an effective Human Rights Council and will present \\nits candidacy for a second term starting in 2010.  \\n The protection of human rights, along with the \\npromotion of democracy and the strengthening of the \\nrule of law will also be priorities of the Swiss \\npresidency of the Council of Europe from November \\n2009 to May 2010. Under the Swiss presidency, efforts \\nwill be made to increase cooperation between the \\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe. \\n 2010 will thus be a symbolic year for the United \\nNations. Five years will have passed since the adoption \\nof the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and ten \\nyears since the signing of the Millennium Declaration. \\nNext year’s summit will be an opportunity to assess the \\nstatus of implementation of these declarations and to \\ninitiate new, more comprehensive reforms. These are \\nnecessary steps because only a reformed United \\nNations will be in a position to find appropriate \\nresponses to the global challenges.  \\n In this context, it is my great pleasure to \\nannounce to Member States that Switzerland has put \\nforward the candidature of Joseph Deiss, former \\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, for the \\npresidency of the sixty-fifth session of the General \\nAssembly. \\n I will conclude with the following: the challenges \\nto be met are huge, however we must not yield to \\npessimism. Throughout history, human beings have \\ndemonstrated time and again that with courage, \\nimagination and persistence they are capable of great \\nachievements. The Swiss writer Max Frisch once said: \\n“A crisis can be a productive state. You just have to get \\n \\n \\n25 09-52320 \\n \\nrid of the aftertaste of disaster.” I absolutely agree. So \\nlet us be productive and seize the opportunity to create \\na prosperous, just, peaceful and sustainable world.', 'It is a \\ngreat honour for me to address, on behalf of \\nSwitzerland, the General Assembly, which this year is \\npresided over by my compatriot, Mr. Joseph Deiss. I \\nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \\nPresident on his election. His election is a great honour \\nfor Switzerland and is not only a personal recognition \\nof President Deiss and his work but also of our \\ncountry’s commitment to the United Nations as a \\nmember of the Organization and a defender of \\nmultilateralism. \\n We find ourselves today in a building that is \\nundergoing renovations. The architectural makeover of \\nthe United Nations prompts me to ask: what kind of \\nUnited Nations are we building for the next 10, 20 or \\n30 years? We need a United Nations that can face the \\nchallenges of the future for the good of all. We need a \\nUnited Nations that will contribute effectively to \\nsolving the world’s problems. We need Member States \\nthat are ready to take full responsibility for building a \\nbetter world. \\n The future of the United Nations must reflect the \\nworld of tomorrow. Today, nearly one billion people \\nare still malnourished. There will be many more people \\nsharing this planet in the future, and no doubt we will \\nhave to make do with fewer resources. Thanks to new \\ndevelopments in technology and information, our \\ncitizens participate more directly in the challenges \\nfacing our societies. They are increasingly better \\ninformed and feel that at least some of the legitimacy \\nof this universal Organization depends on its ability to \\nrespond effectively to those challenges. They demand \\naccountability. \\n In a more globalized world, we must treasure and \\ndefend the principles of the United Nations Charter. We \\nmust take care to ensure the proper functioning of this \\ncommon structure in a spirit of solidarity, respect and \\nresponsibility. \\n A strong international community requires \\nsolidarity. That means more than providing assistance \\nto countries when they are unable to help their own \\ncitizens. It also means reminding States of the \\nresponsibilities they have towards their own people in \\nareas such as security, the rule of law, human rights \\nand democracy, and all that in respect for the United \\nNations Charter. Every woman, every man, every \\ncitizen must make his and her contribution to the \\nstructure we are building together. At the same time \\nevery Member State must be able to place its national \\ninterests second to the common good. That is the only \\nway we will be able to find solutions that are in \\neveryone’s interest.  \\n Every day we are reminded of the growing and \\nincreasingly complex global challenges confronting us: \\nthe economic and financial crisis, climate change, \\nenergy and food security, development and poverty, \\nand peace and security. The search for sustainable \\nsolutions to those challenges calls for real governance, \\ngovernance, moreover, that must reflect the new \\nrealities in the world. The new-found prosperity of \\nsome must go hand in hand with new responsibilities. \\nStates whose economic success enables them to play a \\nmore active role in the governance of the world must \\naccept the new responsibilities that go with that active \\nrole. \\n The United Nations enjoys a unique legitimacy \\nbecause of its universal membership. Its legitimacy \\nalso derives from the issues it addresses, which \\nconcern us all. This week’s agenda is the best possible \\n \\n \\n9 10-54827 \\n \\nproof. But the legitimacy of an organization also \\ndepends on its performance and its ability to respond to \\nthe expectations placed on it.  \\n By that standard the United Nations sometimes \\ndelivers mixed results. At times it seems ill-equipped \\nand hesitant to act. The power derived from universal \\nmembership becomes a burden when we Member \\nStates are divided. Our debates should not be limited to \\nthe lowest common denominator. They must lead to \\naction and to results in the interest of the common \\ngood of humanity. \\n If the United Nations fails to act, other groups \\nrepresenting only a fraction of the countries of the \\nworld will step in, zealous for effective action, and \\nplay a central role in global governance. As far as \\nSwitzerland is concerned, such groups lack legitimacy \\nby virtue of their limited composition. It is therefore \\ncrucial for the United Nations and its principal organs \\nto remain at the centre of world governance. That is \\nwhy we must take care to ensure that the legitimacy of \\nthis universal body does not suffer from a lack of \\nefficiency. To make progress in building a better world, \\nit is our collective responsibility to meet a global \\nchallenge with a global response. Switzerland wants to \\ncontribute to this joint effort. \\n Concerted global action is required in the \\nfollowing areas.  \\n The Millennium Development Goals must be \\nimplemented rapidly and fully. We know that dropping \\na sack of rice from a helicopter is not enough. We must \\ninstead teach people how to grow rice. Still today, \\n1.4 billion people around the world are living in \\nextreme poverty. Every day too many mothers and \\nchildren die of malnutrition and lack of care. We know \\nthat huge financial means are needed after a disaster. \\nMoney flows in emergency situations, but who is still \\nconcerned three years later? Who is involved in the \\nreconstruction? \\n Binding objectives must be defined as quickly as \\npossible for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. \\nNowadays, we have knowledge and we have clean and \\ngreen technology. We must take action, each nation \\nwith measures aimed at its own targets. Waiting for the \\nindustrialized countries to invest in the South will not \\nlead anywhere. Here too, all must fulfil their own \\nresponsibilities. This year in Mexico we still have an \\nopportunity to make progress. The recent natural \\ndisasters are unmistakable signs. Switzerland will \\nreduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by \\nthe year 2020.  \\n Thirty years after the Cold War, the proliferation \\nof weapons of mass destruction remains a grave threat \\nto peace and security. But for civilian populations, the \\nreal devastation is caused by small arms and light \\nweapons. Terrorists benefit from that situation by \\neasily supplying themselves in the arms market. \\nSwitzerland, together with other countries, is \\nsupporting the full implementation of the United \\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. That \\ninitiative provides for the involvement of specialists in \\nhumanitarian aid and education. \\n Gender equality must at last become a reality. \\nAccess to education and health for women and girls \\nhas been restricted for decades. More than others, they \\nhave been victims of poverty. They have also been the \\ntargets of systematic violence in armed conflicts. It is \\nhigh time to make full use of their potential in \\nmediation and reconstruction in countries affected by \\nconflict. In that context, Switzerland welcomes the \\ncreation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women — UN \\nWomen — which brings us closer to the fulfilment of \\nthis vision. \\n We must avoid making the United Nations an \\nimmutable historic monument, but rather turn it into a \\ndynamic organization. The United Nations is the only \\norganization in the world with the legitimacy to \\nrepresent all nations and all peoples. It is the only \\nlegitimate organization in the world capable of \\nnarrowing differences and restoring a balance between \\nregions.  \\n For that to happen, however, every Member State \\nmust accept its responsibilities and start with the task \\nof putting its own house in order. Discussion and \\npreparing reports are not enough, however; we need to \\nact. Each Member State must commit itself clearly \\nwithin the Organization to respond to the urgent \\nquestions facing the world of today and of tomorrow. \\nSuch commitments will strengthen confidence in the \\nUnited Nations and its credibility.  \\n Switzerland remains firmly convinced of the \\naptness of a multilateral approach, with the United \\nNations at its centre. With the contributions of \\neveryone in this Hall today we will be able to create a \\nmore just, peaceful and prosperous world. I thank all \\nwho are gathered here for their collective commitment.', 'It is an \\nhonour for me to speak to the General Assembly today. \\n The world has changed dramatically since the \\nUnited Nations was founded 65 years ago. \\nInternational trade and exchange are, of course, \\nnothing new. What is new, however, is how quickly the \\nchanges affect everybody’s lives. Only if we in the \\nUnited Nations are and remain able to act can we shape \\nthese global changes. We will manage to solve \\nproblems relating to security and economic, social and \\necological development only if the international \\ncommunity stands united. Germany is ready to assume \\nglobal responsibility within the framework of the \\nUnited Nations. \\n Germany’s foreign policy is firmly embedded in \\nthe international community. In Europe, a system of \\ncooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly \\ndivided our continent for centuries. The European \\nUnion is successful because, in Europe, all peoples and \\nStates meet on an equal footing. The United Nations, \\ntoo, brings together nations large and small, rich and \\npoor, those that are more powerful and those with less \\ninfluence. Cooperation between equals on an equal \\nfooting is our guiding principle also for work here at \\nthe United Nations. Each and every country must \\nrespect all others. \\n German foreign policy is a policy of peace. This \\nautumn, Germany will stand for election as a \\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council \\nbecause the Council is the ideal forum in which to \\ncooperate in the cause of peace and development. \\nPeace is more than the absence of war. In today’s \\nglobalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the \\nconsequences of climate change, poverty and \\nunderdevelopment as they are to violence and \\noppression. \\n Climate change has a direct impact on each and \\nevery one of us. Countless people are already \\npersonally feeling its economic and social \\nconsequences. In their letter to the Security Council, \\nthe Pacific island States rightly warned us in no \\nuncertain terms just how much climate change \\nthreatens everyone’s security. Everyone must play their \\n \\n \\n35 10-55103 \\n \\npart to protect the climate. In Germany, we have just \\nadopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year \\n2050, 80 per cent of our electricity production will \\ncome from renewable sources. Germany has also \\npledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 per \\ncent by the year 2020, compared to the 1990 baseline. \\nEven now, we have reduced our carbon dioxide \\nemissions by almost 30 per cent. We are pioneers in the \\nfield of climate protection. We are helping those who \\nare now most adversely affected by climate change. We \\nare particularly concerned about the fate of small \\nisland States. \\n Anyone who is serious about combating climate \\nchange has to build on innovation, new technologies \\nand exchange. Developed and developing nations alike \\ncan profit from cooperation on future energies. \\nGermany will contribute its technological expertise, for \\nexample, in the fields of renewable energy and energy \\nefficiency. In this way, we are turning the challenge of \\nclimate change into an opportunity for fair \\ndevelopment and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy \\nis a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. \\nThe recent summit on the Millennium Development \\nGoals laid down the next steps forward in our global \\npartnership for development. \\n Education is the key to development. \\nDevelopment needs education. Education protects \\npeople from discrimination and oppression. Education \\nfights prejudice and thereby fosters peace. Education \\nalso creates products and markets; education is the path \\nto prosperity. The true wealth of many nations is no \\nlonger found in their raw materials but in the minds of \\ntheir people. Education is a human right. It is because \\neducation will determine whether societies succeed or \\nfail in tomorrow’s world that Germany is one of the \\nmajor international partners for learning. By building \\non education, we are building bridges to the future for \\nthe young people of today. \\n The United Nations itself must also keep up with \\nthe pace of change. Today’s world order is not properly \\nreflected if Africa and Latin America are not \\npermanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, \\ntoo, rightly considers itself to be underrepresented. The \\nentire continent, not just individual States, is \\ndeveloping at breathtaking speed. We take our \\npartnerships seriously, both the old and the new. \\nGermany, too, remains ready to assume greater \\nresponsibility. \\n Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are \\nnot issues of the past but challenges of our time. \\nDisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two \\nsides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly \\ncan to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not \\nbecome the bane of globalization. Unlike the Review \\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons five years ago, \\nthis May’s Review Conference was a success. If we \\nwork together to maintain this momentum, it will be in \\nour power to ensure that this decade does not see a \\nbuild-up of arms but becomes a decade of \\ndisarmament. A world without nuclear weapons is a \\nlong-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the \\nfirst step. \\n There is now movement in the disarmament \\ndebate. The group of States founded here in New York \\non Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms \\ncontrol does not stand alone. For over 10 years, the \\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva was not even \\nable to agree on an agenda. That is not the way to live \\nup to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the \\ninvitation of the Secretary-General to break the \\ndeadlock binding the Geneva Conference. Our world \\nwill be a more secure place when the Comprehensive \\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty enters into force and the \\nproduction of fissile material is ended once and for all. \\n German peace policy stands for the peaceful \\nsettlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its \\nutmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel \\nand the Palestinians are a success. We will continue to \\nstrengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation. \\nDuring this vital period for the peace process in \\nparticular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any \\naction that might block the path to peace. We condemn \\nany form of violence that has the sole aim of \\ntorpedoing the peace talks. At the same time, we call \\nfor the moratorium on settlement construction to be \\nextended. Lasting peace will be achieved only through \\na two-State solution, with Israel and a Palestinian State \\nliving peacefully side by side within secure borders. \\n Iran, like every other country, naturally has the \\nright to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \\nHowever, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt \\nabout the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. \\nIran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can \\nallay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It is \\nnow up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand. \\n  \\n \\n10-55103 36 \\n \\n The conference aimed at establishing a zone free \\nof weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, \\nplanned for 2012, will be a major opportunity to \\nstrengthen peace and security in the region. Germany is \\nencouraging all countries in the region to take part to \\nensure that the conference is a success. We are \\ncommitted to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East. \\n Germany is one of the major supporters of a \\npeaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in \\nLondon and Kabul, we want to transfer security \\nresponsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the \\nAfghan Government by 2014. To make progress in that \\ncountry, so long ravaged by war and civil strife, \\neffective measures must be taken to prevent the \\nviolence. However, military means alone will not bring \\nsuccess. We favour a comprehensive approach and \\nabove all a political solution. All sides now need the \\ncourage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation. \\n The German Government assists when people \\nanywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters \\nand emergencies. However, a country’s conscience is \\nto be found in the hearts of its citizens. I am proud that \\nmy fellow Germans donate so generously at times of \\ngreatest need. Humanity and solidarity are global \\nvalues; humanity and solidarity make no distinction \\nbased on skin colour or religious beliefs. When the \\ntsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, \\nwhen the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of \\ndecades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in \\nPakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared \\nthe victims’ pain and helped in the most heartfelt way \\npossible. We will stand by Pakistan over the coming \\nmonths and years to ensure that the country has a \\npromising economic future. \\n We are working towards a peaceful order in the \\nSudan, now and after the referendum early next year. \\nWe are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions \\nin Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of \\nYemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy \\noff the Horn of Africa and to bring peace and stability \\nto Somalia. \\n Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions \\ncannot bring success overnight. Similarly, for societies \\ntorn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity \\nleads through peace and reconciliation. There can be \\ntrue peace only when human rights are respected. For \\nus, such principles as the rule of law, freedom of \\nopinion, freedom of the press and respect for \\ninalienable human rights are essential. The protection \\nof human rights remains a task for all societies. \\n It is a fundamental tenet of the United Nations \\nthat women determine their own lives and help decide \\nthe fate of their countries. Ethnic or religious \\nminorities enrich their societies. Tolerance is one of \\nGermany’s guiding principles. Everyone wins in the \\ncompetition for the best ideas; in a clash of cultures, \\nthere can only be losers. \\n United Europe can make a valuable contribution \\non our continent and beyond. Germany is working to \\nensure that, in the future, the European Union shall \\ncooperate even more closely with other regions in \\nLatin America, Africa and Asia, and live up to its \\nglobal responsibility. Germany is the third-largest \\ndevelopment cooperation donor. We have practically \\nrecovered from the financial and economic crisis and \\nare on the right track due to our robust economic \\ngrowth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong \\nglobal partner. \\n If all countries, small and large, work together, \\nwe will be able to master the pressing challenges of our \\nworld. \\nThey can count on Germany. They can rely on \\nGermany. ', 'The Headquarters \\nof the United Nations is currently undergoing a major \\nrenovation, and that is a good thing. It is good because \\nthe building no longer meets the requirements of the \\nnew century. In the meantime, work goes on as usual, \\n \\n \\n27 10-55103 \\n \\nand here we all are, discussing the big issues of the \\nday. \\n Of course, the parallel is obvious. The United \\nNations system itself has now reached a certain age \\nand is also in need of renovation. And in this sense, \\ntoo, the day-to-day work of the United Nations must go \\non, for we cannot afford to take a break from tackling \\nthe global problems we face. The United Nations may \\nbe under renovation, but it still has to stay open for \\nbusiness. \\n It was 65 years ago that the United Nations was \\nestablished in San Francisco. There, and at Bretton \\nWoods, the world’s leaders laid the foundations for a \\nmultilateral system that would be built upon the \\nsmoking ruins of the Second World War. This system \\nhas demonstrated its usefulness, but it is based on post-\\nwar realities, not on the international balance of power \\nand the global problems of today. \\n I use the word “renovation”, because we do not \\nneed to build from scratch. Over the past 65 years, the \\nsystem has more than proved its worth. There is \\nnothing wrong with the foundations or the basic \\nstructure. Besides, experience has taught us that a \\npractical step-by-step approach is a more effective way \\nto reform a large organization than reliance on a “big-\\nbang” strategy. Or, as Dag Hammarskjöld, one of the \\ngreat leaders of the United Nations, put it, “Constant \\nattention by a good nurse may be just as important as a \\nmajor operation by a surgeon”. \\n Today, I would like to look briefly at three of the \\ncore tasks of the United Nations in order to show how \\nthe Dutch Government views various concrete reforms \\nin practical terms. Those tasks relate to human rights, \\nthe international legal order, and peace and security. \\nLet me begin, however, with the background to these \\nrenovations, using my own experience as a guide, \\nstarting with the question of why they are necessary. \\n In human terms, 65 years is often an age at which \\nwe start to take things easier. Unfortunately, that is not \\nan option for the United Nations, for despite all our \\nefforts, peace, security, legal certainty and \\ndevelopment are still not guaranteed for everyone. In \\nfact, since the United Nations was established, the \\nglobal challenges facing us have only grown larger. \\nConsider the climate crisis, or the energy and food \\ncrisis, or the international economic crisis that has \\nshown so clearly how closely connected everything is \\nin our time. We need each other more than ever before, \\nand we need the United Nations as the organization \\nuniting us more than ever before. \\n In this light, I applaud the choice of theme for \\nthis sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly: \\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \\nglobal governance” — although I must confess I would \\nhave replaced the word “reaffirming” with \\n“recovering”, because ground has clearly been lost, as \\nhas become especially apparent in the last few years. \\nThe Group of 20, and not the United Nations, has taken \\nthe lead in tackling the economic crisis, for example. \\nThe United Nations Climate Change Conference could \\nhave delivered more if the world had been able to unite \\nbehind the tough decisions. And where the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are concerned, we see \\nmixed results. A lot has been achieved, but on some \\nGoals we are lagging far behind, thanks to a \\nfragmented and defective international aid architecture. \\nWe discussed this earlier in the week at the MDG \\nsummit. \\n What these examples show is that the United \\nNations is losing its position — and its convening \\npower — as the obvious global platform for discussion \\nand decision-making. It pains me to say that. However, \\nI also have every faith that the United Nations can \\ncontinue in the future to claim its vital role as the \\nworld’s overarching governance organization. \\n In my view, the end of the cold war freed the \\nUnited Nations from a long period of confrontation and \\nstagnation. In its wake the international agenda was \\nredefined with great speed and vigour. Relatively new \\ntopics like the environment and climate change, social \\nthemes and gender issues began to claim our attention. \\nThe international legal order was strengthened by new \\ninternational tribunals, the International Criminal Court \\nand a growing number of peace missions under the \\nUnited Nations flag — and of course, in setting the \\nMDGs at its Millennium Summit (resolution 55/2), the \\nUnited Nations showed how ambitious it can be. \\n The United Nations is only able to achieve such \\nthings because every country is involved and everyone \\nhas a voice. That is the power of the United Nations, \\nbut also its greatest weakness. Inclusion does not only \\nfoster legitimacy — the unique selling point of the \\nUnited Nations. It also leads to sluggish decision-\\nmaking, politicized relationships and a bureaucratic \\nstructure that lacks transparency. I believe that anyone \\n  \\n \\n10-55103 28 \\n \\nfamiliar with the international circuit over the past 10 \\nyears will recognize this picture. \\n It is often said, “If the United Nations did not \\nexist it would have to be invented” — and indeed, a \\nglobal organization with universal membership is \\nessential. Still, no matter how representative an \\norganization may be, it will lose its relevance if it does \\nnot deliver sufficient results. In short, legitimacy and \\neffectiveness are two sides of the same coin. \\n The Dutch Government is convinced that the \\nUnited Nations can improve its effectiveness and \\ndecisiveness and so increase its legitimacy and public \\nsupport. This can be done by utilizing the United \\nNations and its process to solve problems and by \\nputting practical considerations first when problems \\nare tackled. The Netherlands wants to see that happen \\nand will work to make it happen. We will do so as a \\nfounding Member of the United Nations but also \\ntogether with our partners in the European Union, of \\nwhich we also are a founding member. The European \\nUnion is strongly committed to the United Nations, and \\nwe subscribe to its contributions to secure the future of \\nthe United Nations. \\n That brings me to the first of the three core tasks \\nI mentioned at the start of my speech: human rights. \\nThis, without question, is an area in which the United \\nNations has achieved great success in setting standards, \\nwith the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an \\nunshakeable basis. Unfortunately, though, it still falls \\nshort in enforcing those standards. We still hear reports \\nevery day of torture, unfair trials, curbs on freedom of \\nexpression and other human rights violations. The \\nDutch Government considers it unacceptable that \\npeople, often women, are still being stoned to death in \\n2010. We must continue to resist this practice with \\nevery ounce of our being. \\n The Dutch Government urges that the capacity of \\nthe human rights machinery, and particularly the \\nHuman Rights Council, be strengthened. To start with, \\na clear division of tasks between the Human Rights \\nCouncil and the Third Committee of this General \\nAssembly is needed. Overlap and lack of clarity make \\nit too easy for some regimes to distract attention from \\nhuman rights violations. The Netherlands will press for \\nclarity. \\n Of course, human rights are closely related to the \\ninternational legal order, the second area I want to \\ntouch on. As you know, this is a subject very close to \\nthe Netherlands’ heart. The city of The Hague is not \\nonly the centre of Dutch democracy, it is also known as \\nthe legal capital of the world — and we are proud of \\nthat. More important, though, of course, is the fact that \\nthe international institutions based in The Hague are \\nsending a clear message with the work they undertake. \\nThe international community will not allow human \\nrights violations and crimes against humanity to go \\nunpunished. That applies to the various ad hoc \\ntribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal \\nfor the Former Yugoslavia. It also applies to the \\nInternational Court of Justice and of course the \\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). \\n Over the last 20 years international criminal law \\nhas developed at an impressive rate. Today, those who \\ncommit the most terrible crimes, wherever in the world \\nthey may be, know that their chances of being called to \\naccount are growing by the day. Now we must act \\nboldly. We must strengthen these institutions’ visibility, \\ncredibility and authority. We can do that by improving \\ninternational cooperation on investigations and \\nprosecutions, by increasing compliance with the \\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and by pushing \\nfor as many countries as possible to sign the Rome \\nStatute and to conduct themselves according to both its \\nletter and its spirit. With that in mind, I say that it is \\nunacceptable to the Dutch Government that someone \\nlike President Al-Bashir of the Sudan, against whom an \\narrest warrant is outstanding, should be allowed to \\nmove freely in a country that is an ICC partner. \\n In closing, I would like to say a few words about \\nthe broad topic of peace and security. At this moment, \\nthere are some 100,000 people taking part in United \\nNations peace missions around the world. So no one \\ncan deny that the United Nations plays a leading role in \\nthis area — and rightly so, because it is precisely in \\nmatters of war and peace that legitimacy and resolve \\nare most essential. Such legitimacy and resolve can \\nonly be provided by the United Nations and the \\nSecurity Council. \\n We saw only recently, in the incident involving \\nthe Republic of Korea’s naval ship, the Cheonan, how \\ndifficult and shaky the position of the Security Council \\ncan sometimes be. On the one hand, the Council \\ncondemned the attack unanimously and in strong \\nterms, and that has to be applauded. On the other hand, \\nthe Council remained silent on the question of blame, \\nwhich is an extremely hard thing to bear for the \\nsurvivors and the victims’ loved ones. \\n \\n \\n29 10-55103 \\n \\n It is precisely in order to guarantee the legitimacy \\nand strength of the Security Council in the future that \\nthe Dutch Government continues to support reforms of \\nthe Council that reflect the geopolitical realities of \\ntoday and not of 1945. Naturally, the exact substance \\nof those reforms is still open to debate. But it is clear \\nto the Netherlands that there should be more room for \\nmore countries to join the discussions and exert \\ninfluence: room for large countries that in 1945 were \\nnot yet large enough or were not yet Members of the \\nUnited Nations; but also room for smaller nations that, \\nas troop-supplying countries or as interested parties in \\na particular region, should have the right to speak. I \\nwould add immediately that countries that want \\ninfluence should realize that this entails financial, \\npolitical and moral obligations. Or, in the words of \\nWinston Churchill, the price of greatness is \\nresponsibility. \\n I have briefly sketched why the United Nations is \\nin need of renovation. I hope I have made clear that its \\nrelevance is tied not only to its legitimacy but also to \\nits effectiveness. And I have suggested the direction the \\nrenovation might take in three specific areas. One thing \\nI have not yet done, however, is to reaffirm that the \\nNetherlands, in keeping with its long international \\ntradition, will continue to work for quality in the \\nUnited Nations system. Together with others, together \\nwith all represented in this Hall, we will work in the \\nknowledge that this renovation, like all our activities, \\nrequires us to pool our resources. Or, as the United \\nNations Charter says: “unite our strength” and \\n“combine our efforts”. Let those words inspire us in \\nthe work that lies ahead.', '\\nHistory has shown us that words can change the face of \\nthe world. It has proven that the spoken word can \\ninfluence the future, but only when they go beyond \\nrhetoric. What is our global governance worth if it does \\nnot go beyond the expression of ambitions and \\nintentions? Words remain ineffectual if they are not \\nfollowed up with action. We must therefore act. I say \\n“we”, the nations united, because no country, no matter \\n \\n \\n47 10-54833 \\n \\nhow large, can respond alone to the great challenges \\nfacing humanity. I say “we” because no large-scale \\nproblem is limited to a single country, leaving \\nuntouched the lives of those who live elsewhere. The \\nobligation to act is a shared, global responsibility.\\n That is why today my message is about \\nresponsibility and increased accountability. \\n At the heart of any form of governance lies \\nresponsibility, be it global or local, national or \\ninternational. But this is not enough. Indeed, \\ngovernance is not only about behaving responsibly; it \\nis also about being accountable. This applies not only \\nat the level of the single State, but also at the level of \\nour United Nations. \\n Human rights, security and development are at \\nthe core of the mandate of the United Nations. Former \\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out the fact that \\nthe three are inextricably linked when he said: \\n “There will be no development without security \\nand no security without development. And both \\ndevelopment and security also depend on respect \\nfor human rights and the rule of law.” \\n(A/59/2005, annex, para. 2) \\nIt has indeed become common knowledge that human \\nrights are unlikely to be protected in an insecure and \\nunderdeveloped environment and that economic \\ndevelopment cannot be durably sustained in a society \\nwhere there is no rule of law. \\n Accountability in international affairs is about \\nrespecting international law — the rules that govern \\nrelations among States. Without a solid legal basis, \\ninternational cooperation remains optional and falls \\nshort of the necessary transparency and long-term \\nsustainability. Important steps have been taken to \\nuphold the rule of law at the international level over \\nthe past decades. \\n Belgium pleads for the universal acceptance of \\nthe competence of the International Court of Justice \\nand the International Criminal Court. If all countries \\nwere willing to follow up on this appeal, we would be \\na step closer to having an effective and accountable \\ninternational system. \\n Meeting our responsibilities in the field of human \\nrights means ensuring efficient means and mechanisms \\nto ensure their protection. We need to instil more \\ncoherence to our action. Unfortunately, today we focus \\nour attention all too often on how to react to human \\nrights violations while we should focus more on \\nprevention and on the root causes of those violations. \\n Human rights are universal. My country strongly \\nopposes any form of relativism in this respect. \\n International and regional human rights \\ninstruments need to be strengthened. The evaluation \\nwithin the Human Rights Council in 2011 should give \\nimportant momentum to that strengthening. \\n There is also a need for increased accountability \\nin the field of security, another pillar of the United \\nNations. Over the past year, important progress has \\nbeen made. The Review Conference of the Parties to \\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty came to a substantial and \\nbalanced result. Respect for Non-Proliferation Treaty \\nprovisions and cooperation with the International \\nAtomic Energy Agency are accountability in practice. \\nUnfortunately, the non-acceptance or non-respect of \\nthese provisions by countries like North Korea and Iran \\nthreatens the international non-proliferation regime. \\n In particular, Belgium welcomes the entry into \\nforce earlier this year of the Convention on Cluster \\nMunitions. The prohibition of the production and use \\nof cluster munitions has become the international \\nstandard. I am pleased and proud to announce that \\nBelgium has recently destroyed its entire stock of \\ncluster munitions. \\n The Millennium Development Goals and climate \\nnegotiations are at the top of our twenty-first century \\nagenda, and rightly so. We are all responsible for our \\nplanet. In fact, we are all accountable to current and \\nfuture generations, especially in the field of poverty \\nreduction and environmental protection. Let us not \\nforget the ancient Native American saying: “We do not \\ninherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from \\nour children”. \\n Creating a world that is equitable, a world that \\nwill last, is our common responsibility. Belgium is \\ndoing so by spending 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic \\nproduct on development cooperation. \\n If we indeed accept the need to be accountable \\nfor the results we do or do not obtain, we should have \\nthe courage to evaluate and adapt the institutions and \\ninstruments at our disposal. In that respect, Belgium \\nfully supports the efforts of the European Union to \\n  \\n \\n10-54833 48 \\n \\nparticipate in a timely and effective manner in the work \\nof the General Assembly. \\n If it is to contribute effectively to global \\ngovernance and to take up its global responsibility, the \\nUnited Nations needs to continue its efforts to become \\nmore representative and more efficient. The creation of \\nUN Women was a welcome development, and it has \\nmy country’s full support. Of course, gender will need \\nto remain a mainstream theme influencing the actions \\nof each and every United Nations institution. \\n Important discussions on the reform of the \\nSecurity Council have been ongoing for quite some \\ntime. Belgium hopes that the negotiations will soon \\nlead to concrete results. \\n I have talked about institutions, and concerns \\nabout institutions are, of course, legitimate. But they \\nshould never lead us to forget that the first \\naccountability of humankind is not created by \\nabstractions or institutions, but by the face of a person \\nin dire need; of the man, woman or child who is the \\nvictim of violence; of those who suffer the violence of \\nnature, or from violence perpetrated by other men. \\n When it comes to humanitarian protection and \\naid, responsibility and accountability have never been \\nmore necessary. That is why United Nations \\npeacekeeping missions with strong mandates, \\nespecially in the field of the protection of civilians, are \\nimportant and should be given the necessary \\ninstruments, not least in the context of the fight against \\nsexual violence. In this context, Belgium strongly \\nsupports Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and \\nits goals of ensuring the participation, protection and \\npromotion of women in peace and security. \\n The concept of sovereignty cannot be used as a \\njustification for human rights violations against the \\ncitizens of any country. On the contrary, sovereignty \\nimplies the responsibility to protect, and we support \\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to further put this \\nprinciple into practice. \\n My key message of increased responsibility and \\naccountability also applies to certain situations in the \\nworld that I would like to address briefly: the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and \\nPakistan.\\n The fiftieth anniversary of the independence of \\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has been an \\nopportunity to measure the unquestionable progress \\nmade over recent years. What is important as we move \\nforward is the consolidation of peace and democracy in \\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Belgium is \\npleased that the mandate of the United Nations \\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo has incorporated the element of \\npeacebuilding alongside that of peacekeeping. \\n The elections in 2006 allowed the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo to choose the path of \\ndemocratization. The Congolese authorities have \\nexpressed their determination to persevere on this path \\nin confirming their intention to hold elections in 2011. \\nThat deserves our full support. \\n Despite all this progress, it is clear that many \\nchallenges remain. In spite of the rapprochement \\namong its neighbours, the situation in the East of the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo remains worrisome. \\nWe were reminded of this by the shocking reports of \\nwidespread rape in Luvungi. \\n The fight against impunity, which is crucial to my \\ncountry, hinges first and foremost on the strengthening \\nof the rule of law. It is one of the primary \\nresponsibilities of the authorities, but here, too, the \\nsupport of the United Nations and the international \\ncommunity is crucial. Belgium calls on the \\ninternational community to continue to assume its \\nresponsibility. Like in every country, the Afghan Government is \\nheld accountable by the Afghan people. We hope that \\nlast weekend’s elections contributed to this. However, \\nthe Afghan authorities do not stand alone. The \\ninternational community, with a central role for the \\nUnited Nations, assists the Afghan Government in \\nenhancing the level of accountability to its population. \\nGradually, the Afghan authorities need to take on more \\nresponsibility, especially in the field of security. This \\ntransfer is welcome, but rather than being calendar-\\ndriven, it should be results-driven. \\n The Belgian Government has decided to extend \\nits current military and civilian presence until the end \\nof 2011. We believe that 2011 will be of crucial \\nimportance in transferring further security \\n \\n \\n49 10-54833 \\n \\nresponsibilities. The focus of the Belgian presence \\nbeyond 2011 will therefore likely be more and more on \\ncivilian assistance. \\n Nobody can remain untouched by the devastation \\nand human suffering caused by the floods in Pakistan. \\nAs members of the international community, we have \\nto take on our responsibility. This “slow-motion \\ntsunami”, as the Secretary-General called it, demands a \\nlong-term and strategic answer. Belgium therefore \\nwelcomes the three-step approach — the meeting last \\nSunday in New York, the meeting in Brussels next \\nmonth of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan, and the \\ndonor event in November — which clearly sets out the \\nframework for reconstruction. \\n We have to move beyond the stage of emergency \\naid. In this respect, I am glad to say that the European \\nUnion last week took the firm commitment to improve \\nmarket access for Pakistan as a concrete measure to \\nreinvigorate Pakistan’s economy. \\n Allow me to conclude by recalling John F. \\nKennedy’s observation that the only reward for a \\npolitician is a good conscience. It may be true that not \\nmany other rewards should be expected for politicians. \\nBut even so, the conscience of a politician cannot free \\nhim from the obligation of being accountable to those \\nhe wants to serve, to the people he wants to represent \\nand to the country he wants to lead.', 'I \\ncome to this rostrum on behalf of France to express my \\nsincere and fervent faith in the United Nations. \\nFrance’s ambition is to be a major actor in building a \\nsystem of global governance that is more just, more \\ncohesive, more social, and a global order that is \\norganized and regulated around a stronger, more \\nrepresentative and more effective United Nations — a \\nUnited Nations capable of meeting the great challenges \\nof our century. \\n I look out upon the Assembly. I know many of \\nthose present here today. For 25 years now — even \\nmore — I have been going up and down the corridors \\nof the United Nations because I like the United \\nNations, because I believe in the United Nations, and \\nbecause I know it to be indispensable. \\n I would like to speak to the Assembly candidly. I \\nam going to talk about men and women, suffering and \\nhope. I am going to talk about responsibility, because \\nwe have responsibilities as citizens, diplomats and \\npolitical leaders to meet these sufferings, hopes and \\nexpectations. \\n Of course, all of us would have an infinite \\nnumber of reasons to present a litany of generous \\nintentions, only to go home, our conscience clear, for \\nwhat we had said a little while before to the Assembly \\nand then go back to our day-to-day problems at home. \\nOf course, after the terrible economic crisis from which \\nwe have barely emerged, we have to live with reduced \\nbudgets and tense socio-economic situations. The times \\nare difficult and our fellow citizens are worried. The \\ntemptation to retreat exists. Of course, to correct the \\nlarge imbalances and injustices that undermine our \\nsociety and to fight for the planet’s security and \\ndevelopment, we can always count on others. But \\nwhich others? There are no “others”. We are all here, \\nthe nations of the world, represented in the General \\nAssembly, and we only have to decide together to act. \\n Not acting today would be to resign ourselves to \\ndisorder, injustice and chaos. That choice will never be \\nFrance’s because it is not in keeping with our history, \\nor our values, or our interests. Faced with disorder in \\nthe world, the greatest risk today would be to lapse into \\nroutine. Please do not tell me that we cannot move \\nforward, that the situation is at an impasse. No, in the \\npast, we have been able together, collectively, to be \\nrevolutionary on fundamental subjects, even at the \\nexpense of the national sovereignties which we all \\nrepresent here. \\n Recall our boldness here in 1988, General \\nAssembly resolution 43/131, and then two years later, \\nresolution 45/100, on humanitarian assistance to \\nvictims of natural disasters and similar emergency \\nsituations. These resolutions allowed us for the first \\ntime to guarantee free access of humanitarian workers \\nto the affected regions. Then there was Security \\nCouncil 688 (1991) (5 April 1991) on the situation in \\nKurdistan, where, for the first time, the door was \\nopened to a military operation to protect civilian \\npopulations against an oppressor State. \\n These were two historic moments which laid the \\nfirst markers of the right to intervene. This became the \\nresponsibility to protect, which this Assembly adopted \\nby consensus at the 2005 World Summit (see resolution \\n60/1). Who could have imagined that such an upending \\nof international law would be possible? The fight was \\nlong and difficult; it is not over — far from it. To speak \\ncandidly to the Assembly, the results are not \\ncompletely what I had expected. But we must note that, \\ntogether, we were able to overcome some obstacles \\nwhich were supposed to be insurmountable. Let \\nnothing stop us from taking up subjects which we \\ndecide on together. \\n Our first shared responsibility is development — \\nto make sure that all men and women, including the \\nmost impoverished, have decent living conditions. The \\nwidening gap of inequalities is not only morally \\nunacceptable, it is politically dangerous. Of course, it \\nis costly to act, but the cost of inaction is even greater. \\n The conclusions of the High-level Meeting on the \\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that we just \\nheld place our responsibilities squarely before us. This \\n \\n \\n37 10-55122 \\n \\nis an urgent matter. We can no longer ask suffering \\npopulations to continue to wait. \\n The President of the French Republic, Nicolas \\nSarkozy, reminded the Assembly of this fact, that France \\nis the second largest global donor of official \\ndevelopment assistance — €9 billion per annum — \\ntargeted to education, health, food security, sanitation \\nand infrastructure. France’s commitment to development \\nwill not slacken, but figures do not make a policy. Our \\nassistance must be judged according to its results. We \\nneed to go further and move faster for children dying of \\nmalaria — one every 30 seconds — for entire families \\nstricken by AIDS, and for all those who are hungry or \\ncannot go to school. \\n I ask the Assembly: what planet do we wish to \\nleave as a legacy to our children? Will we be able to \\nmake an ambitious decision to combat climate change \\nand preserve our environment? This is a subject that \\nconcerns us all and requires a global partnership, one \\nwhere we aspire to find an agreement on both reducing \\nemissions and measures to be taken in order to adapt. \\nAnd we must, first and foremost, ensure that the \\ncommitments undertaken will be implemented and that \\nfollow-up mechanisms and effective institutions will be \\nput in place. \\n For all of this, we must find a great deal of \\nmoney — several tens of billions of dollars per year — \\nfor us and our planet. Let us provide the means to \\nrealize our ambitions. The solutions are here, within \\nreach; they have proved to be effective and await only \\nour political will and our courage. They are called \\ninnovative financing. The tax on airline tickets was a \\nstep forward, a long time in coming. Today we should \\ngo farther by adopting an international tax on financial \\ntransactions which would permanently change matters \\nfor development. It is an idea that I have been \\ndefending for more than 20 years. It is a priority for \\nFrance now. The President alluded to it here a few days \\nago. \\n Bear in mind that a minute tax of 0.005 per cent, \\nthat is five cents on a transaction of €1,000, could raise \\n€30 billion to €40 billion per year, almost one quarter \\nof official development assistance. Who could deny \\nthat this is a stable and predictable way of raising a \\nmassive amount for development? Even with half of \\nthat amount, it would be possible to send every child to \\nschool in the low-income countries. Everyone agrees \\ntoday that it is technically and economically feasible to \\nestablish such a mechanism. \\n And, make no mistake; we are not talking about \\ndiminishing official development assistance or dodging \\nour responsibilities. No, on the contrary, this amount \\nwould come as an addition. And so we must not waste \\ntime, we are together, this is what we established this \\ninstitution for, this institution, unparalleled in history, \\ncalled the United Nations. \\n It is now a universally recognized principle that \\ndevelopment cannot occur without peace and security, \\nwhich are the basic raison d’être of the United Nations. \\nHere, the challenges remain considerable. Afghanistan, \\nSomalia, the Sudan, the Middle East — so many \\nconflicts continue to feed chaos throughout the world. \\n How many missed opportunities, how many \\ndashed hopes, how many misunderstandings have for \\nmore than 60 years — I repeat, 60 years — marked this \\nprocess, peaceful in name only, in the Middle East? \\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict concerns us all. I say Arab-\\nIsraeli because, besides the Palestinian track, France \\nconsiders it just as important to work on the Lebanese \\nand Syrian tracks. Today we have before us a historic \\nopportunity. We cannot let it slip. \\n The process almost stopped yesterday evening. I \\nam not sure that it will continue in an orderly way and \\nwith unanimous support. I hope it will. We have \\nlimited time remaining. Palestine, the new State \\nMember of the United Nations which many of us have \\nbeen calling for, will be, I hope, the best guarantee of \\nsecurity for Israel. \\n All States in the region have a critical role to \\nplay. All of that is important, but what is necessary is \\nthat the Israelis and Palestinians make a strategic \\ndecision to put an end to this conflict in their own \\ninterests. I would therefore call on the sense of \\nresponsibility of President Abbas and Prime Minister \\nNetanyahu; together they must make the painful \\ncompromises on the road to peace. \\n I have said that I have faith in the United Nations. \\nI served the United Nations, as perhaps you know, in \\nKosovo and in a number of other places. I know, \\nrespect and deeply love the men and women who give \\nlife to the United Nations. From this rostrum, I wish to \\npay tribute with emotion, affection and respect, to all \\nthose who, in serving the United Nations, take risks \\nevery day for our shared ideal of peace and \\n  \\n \\n10-55122 38 \\n \\ndevelopment. I think of all the friends we have lost — \\nand the friends we may still lose — year after year, \\nand, of course, of those who take their place. \\n The fight is noble. Respect for the values and \\nuniversal principles of human rights constitutes the \\nindispensable foundation on which United Nations \\naction must be built. The ambition to build a world \\norder founded on universal respect for human dignity \\nhas been and will always be at the heart of French \\ndiplomacy. \\n Have we collectively progressed in our service of \\nthese values? Not enough. How long will we continue \\nto accept — now that we live in a so-called \\ninformation society, a world where people can know \\nwhat is happening in other places — that, in terms of \\nhuman rights, there are so many blind spots, so many \\nforgotten tragedies and so much suffering that remain \\nhidden? As I asked at the beginning, what has become \\nof the responsibility to protect? \\n Today the success of the United Nations must \\nfirst of all be assessed in terms of its contribution to \\nthe protection of civilians. That is the first area in \\nwhich our requirements should be upheld. Every day \\nmassacres and rapes are committed throughout the \\nworld, in Somalia, in Darfur and in the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo, including in regions where \\npeacekeeping operations are deployed. \\n We can no longer simply count the victims when \\nmass crimes are committed. Our courage must not be \\nless than that of those who die from risks that we no \\nlonger know how to take. \\n France believes that the International Criminal \\nCourt is one of the most important advances made in \\nthe history of a humankind conscious of the dangers to \\nwhich it is exposed by its own demons. France \\nunderstands the criticism of those that believe that the \\nCourt is too slow or that it goes too far. Let us be clear, \\nFrance will always support the idea of international \\ncriminal justice that is impartial and universal, for it is \\nthe only way of fulfilling the imperative dictated by \\nour history, namely, combating impunity. To all who \\nare shocked by the boldness of some of the Court’s \\nprosecutions, I say that, on the contrary, it would be \\nappalling if the victims were deprived of their right to \\njustice. \\n Human rights, the protection of civilians, \\ninternational justice — these are not hollow concepts \\nor empty principles for us. For France, they are first \\nand foremost principles of action, and the only valid \\ncriterion for judgement is the impact of our actions on \\nthe actual situation. \\n In Guinea, after the killings in the Conakry \\nstadium, on 28 September 2009, we came together to \\ndenounce the human rights violations and to assist the \\nvictims of the atrocities committed. The Secretary-\\nGeneral dispatched an International Commission of \\nInquiry to the field one month after the fact, and I \\nwould like to once again thank him sincerely for that. \\nThe Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court \\ninstituted proceedings. That pressure enabled Guinean \\ncivil society in the field to make the difference. Today \\nthe junta has been replaced by a transitional executive. \\nNothing has been won. There will be a second round of \\nelections in two weeks. But I wanted to recall this \\nsuccess of the United Nations since at the beginning I \\nsaid that the responsibility to protect was threatened. I \\nthink we can all agree that there is a movement \\nforming in civil society throughout the world and that \\nwe can still take action.', 'The values upon which the Organization was founded, \\n65 years ago, are still appropriate for overcoming the \\nglobal challenges we face today. Whether in fighting \\npoverty, protecting the environment and conserving \\nbiodiversity, building peace in conflict areas, helping \\npopulations affected by natural disasters, promoting \\nhuman rights, the rule of law and democracy in the \\nworld, making progress towards disarmament and \\nnon-proliferation or combating terrorism, we need to \\nwork together today more than ever before. \\n You yourself, Mr. President, have quite rightly \\norganized the general debate under the theme \\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \\nglobal governance”. As a founding Member of the \\nUnited Nations, Luxembourg fully endorses the \\nSecretary-General’s assessment that only the United \\nNations has the scope, knowledge and legitimacy \\nnecessary to develop and implement effective policies \\nin order to address global challenges, which require \\nurgent and collective responses. However, we cannot \\ncontent ourselves with that simple article of faith. We \\nneed to draw the necessary conclusions and take \\nresponsibility for them. Those responsibilities are both \\nindividual and collective ones, especially for members \\nof the international community and our universal \\nOrganization. \\n At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \\nMillennium Development Goals, which was held \\nearlier this week, we reiterated our collective \\ndetermination to do everything possible to free \\nhumankind from hunger, illiteracy and disease and \\nultimately to free the Earth of inequalities — between \\nand within continents, regions and countries and \\nbetween men and women. \\n Luxembourg welcomes this renewed commitment \\nto combat poverty in its manifold dimensions. The \\nestablishment of a true partnership for development is \\nbased upon shared responsibilities for both donor and \\nrecipient countries. Although we rely on stronger \\naction from developing countries on good governance, \\nthe rule of law, capacity-building and development \\nownership, developed countries must fulfil their \\ncommitments in terms of aid quality and quantity. This \\nis a needed basis for such a partnership, particularly \\nwith regard to Africa. \\n I am proud to say that Luxembourg is among the \\ncountries to have kept its promises. We strive to be a \\nreliable international partner, even in times of crisis. \\nBy 2000, Luxembourg’s official development \\nassistance (ODA) had reached the threshold of 0.7 per \\ncent of gross national income (GNI), and in 2009, our \\nODA surpassed 1 per cent of GNI. Our Government is \\ncommitted to maintaining this effort, both in terms of \\nvolume and percentage of gross national income. That \\neffort is necessarily linked to steadily growing quality \\nof aid. \\n The duty to prevent, contain and resolve violent \\nconflict is a central aim of our Organization. The \\n  \\n \\n10-54959 36 \\n \\nCharter calls on us to unite our forces in order to \\nmaintain international peace and security. With more \\nthan 120,000 men and women deployed, peacekeeping \\noperations have reached an unprecedented scale in \\nrecent years. While the stabilizing role of United \\nNations forces is undeniable, the changing nature of \\nconflicts and the increasing complexity of mandates \\nhave also revealed the limits of the system, structures \\nand basic tools of our Organization. \\n The mass rapes and sexual assaults that took \\nplace in North Kivu this summer and the inability of \\nthe United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo to protect \\ncivilians are stark reminders of the difficulty of \\nmaintaining peace in conflict areas in the absence of \\nadequate resources and mandates. Those atrocities \\ncompel us to urgently continue the debate on the future \\nof peacekeeping operations and to overcome our \\ndifferences and divisions on this particular issue. \\n They also serve to underscore once again the \\nimportance of substantial United Nations action to \\neradicate the use of sexual violence as a weapon of \\nwar. In that regard, I welcome the appointment of \\nMs. Margot Wallström as Special Representative of the \\nSecretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. In \\nthis, the tenth anniversary year of Security Council \\nresolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and \\nsecurity, such heinous acts and flagrant violations of \\nhuman rights can no longer be tolerated. Impunity must \\nalso be brought to an end. \\n While the primary responsibility for the safety \\nand safety of its citizens and for combating poverty and \\nestablishing the rule of law lies within the Congolese \\nGovernment, the international community must do \\neverything possible to support that Government in its \\nefforts to ensure that those responsible for these \\nhorrendous crimes are actively sought out, tried and \\npunished. Combating impunity must also lead us to be \\nfar more attentive to the report on violations of human \\nrights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \\nbetween 1993 and 2003, the publication of which the \\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \\nHuman Rights has announced for 1 October 2010. \\n As I said at the Review Conference of the Rome \\nStatute, held in Kampala in May, combating impunity \\nfor the most serious crimes should not be an abstract \\ngoal any longer, but become a tangible and concrete \\nreality. All of us must cooperate to ensure success in \\nthat regard. \\n Year after year, in this very forum, we express \\nour hope to see peace established in the Middle East. \\nWe once again call for a solution based on the \\ncoexistence of two States, Israel and Palestine, living \\nside by side in peace and security. We urge the parties \\nto assume their responsibility to create through their \\nactions the framework for a lasting settlement of the \\nconflict. To date, as we know, such calls have mostly \\nbeen in vain. \\n The resumption of direct talks between Israelis \\nand Palestinians on 2 September 2010, however, once \\nagain gives me hope that we will finally reach a final \\nsettlement that ends the occupation that began in 1967 \\nand leads to the birth of an independent, democratic, \\nviable and contiguous Palestinian State living in peace \\nand security with Israel and its other neighbours. I \\ngenuinely hope that the call by President Obama to \\nwork to achieve a Palestinian State in 2011 will \\nbecome a reality. \\n However, we must not be distracted by the \\nenemies of peace and those who seek to sabotage peace \\ntalks. It will be important for both parties to show \\ndetermination, courage, calm and restraint, and to act \\nsolely according to international law. Hence the \\nimportance of ending all settlement activities. They are \\nillegal, contrary to international law and clearly \\nconstitute an obstacle to peace. Why is that so? While \\nthe material fact of building on another person’s land is \\nin itself to be condemned, it is also a symbol of \\ndomination and humiliation that cannot be accepted. As \\na European, I am heartened that the European Union \\npersists in its strong unanimous call for a prolongation \\nof the moratorium beyond next Sunday, 26 September \\n2010. President Obama’s position is clearly and \\nunambiguously along the same lines. \\n Meanwhile, it will be of paramount importance to \\nfind a lasting solution for the situation in Gaza and to \\nrevive its economy. The blockade continues. I hope \\nthat the calls by the United Nations Relief and Works \\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East will at \\nlast be heard. In that context, I welcome the launching \\nby the Secretary-General of an international \\ninvestigation into last May’s incident involving the aid \\nflotilla en route to Gaza. A full, honest, impartial, \\nbalanced and transparent investigation consistent with \\n \\n \\n37 10-54959 \\n \\ninternational standards is of great importance. It also, \\nof course, entails the credibility of our Organization. \\n In the Sudan, the implementation of the \\nComprehensive Peace Agreement is entering its final \\nphase with the referendum on the self-determination of \\nSouthern Sudan and Abyei. After more than two \\ndecades of confrontation, the prospects for a settlement \\nare taking shape at last. The road ahead nevertheless \\nremains fraught with difficulties. It is our collective \\nresponsibility to help the Sudan steer through this \\ncritical period and carry out a process that at last leads \\nto lasting peace for its people. We must ensure that the \\nelections are conducted in a transparent and peaceful \\nmanner, regardless, of course, of the outcome. \\n Increased efforts are also needed to support the \\ncurrent initiatives of the African Union and the United \\nNations towards a political solution involving all \\nparties in Darfur in order to address the root causes of \\nthe conflict and ensure the protection and promotion of \\nhuman rights, justice and reconciliation. The \\ncontinuing violence in Darfur threatens the stability of \\nthe whole of the Sudan and of the larger region. \\n A comprehensive approach is also needed in \\nSomalia, a country that has for too long been \\nsynonymous with civil war and bloody conflict. Only a \\ncomprehensive approach will put an end to the terrorist \\nthreat that armed groups pose to Somalia, the \\nsubregion and the entire international community, as \\nwell as permanently eradicating piracy and establishing \\nthe rule of law in Somalia. \\n My country seeks to play its full effective role in \\nthe global efforts to resolve the crisis in Somalia. To \\nthat end, Luxembourg actively participates in \\nOperation Atalanta to deter, prevent and suppress acts \\nof piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast, as \\nwell as in the military mission to help train security \\nforces of the Transitional Federal Government — two \\noperations launched by the European Union in support \\nof Security Council decisions. Together with our \\nEuropean and African partners, we intend to continue \\nour support for the Djibouti peace process and for the \\nsearch for a lasting political solution. \\n Allow me for a moment to address another issue \\nthat I believe it is important not to overlook when \\ndiscussing ways to guarantee and strengthen peace, \\nsecurity and stability at the international level: \\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. The success of the \\neighth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held \\nhere in New York in May, brought us closer to our \\ncommon goal of a world safer for all and free of \\nnuclear weapons. It will now be important to maintain \\nthe political momentum and to ensure the full \\nimplementation of the decisions taken, including that \\nrelating to the holding by 2012 of a conference on a \\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. I am \\ncertain that progress in this area will not remain \\nwithout implications for other actors and for other \\nissues. \\n In addition, as I had the opportunity to say \\nyesterday at the ministerial meeting on revitalizing the \\nwork of the Conference on Disarmament convened by \\nthe Secretary-General, we must continue our efforts at \\nboth nuclear and conventional disarmament. The \\nconstant search for security at the lowest possible level \\nof armaments will make an essential contribution to \\nstability in the world. \\n In that regard, I welcome the entry into force, on \\n1 August 2010, of the Convention on Cluster \\nMunitions, which prohibits the use, production, \\ntransfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions. At the \\nnational level, Luxembourg, which was among the first \\ncountries to sign and ratify the Convention, has also \\nprohibited the funding of cluster munitions. \\n The progress made towards a legally binding \\narms trade instrument under the auspices of the United \\nNations is also to be welcomed. The problems linked to \\nthe unregulated trade in conventional weapons and the \\ndiversion of those weapons into illicit markets have the \\npotential to fuel instability, organized crime and \\nterrorism, thereby  jeopardizing peace, security and \\nsustainable economic and social development. Hence \\nthe importance of finally adopting a binding instrument \\nin this field. \\n Next week, together with other partners, my \\ncountry will hold a symposium in Boston on an arms \\ntrade treaty. All United Nations Member States have \\nbeen invited to participate. We hope thereby to \\ncontribute to the discussion and consideration of this \\nimportant issue. \\n If we believe in the relevance of a multilateral \\napproach based on the United Nations, we must give \\nthe Organization the means to be the centre of \\nmultilateral action and a real catalyst for change. We \\nneed to push for decisive internal reforms, including, I \\nbelieve, reform of the Security Council. We are all \\n  \\n \\n10-54959 38 \\n \\naware of the need for Council reform to make it more \\ninclusive and more representative of today’s realities, \\nas well as more effective and more transparent. \\nEnsuring an adequate place for small States, which \\nnow represent the vast majority of the Organization’s \\nMember States, is paramount in this regard. \\n We must review the instruments at our disposal, \\nbe it peacekeeping operations, to which I referred \\npreviously, the Peacebuilding Commission or the \\nHuman Rights Council, including the necessary \\nintegration of human rights in all aspects of United \\nNations action.  \\n The Peacebuilding Commission represents a key \\nasset for the operational capacity of the international \\ncommunity in the vast peace agenda. Luxembourg fully \\nsupports the philosophy behind the Commission and is \\nactively involved in the Guinea-Bissau configuration. \\nThe Commission has begun to prove its usefulness. \\nHowever, we should consider how we can make its \\nresults more tangible at the country level in order to \\nallow other countries to benefit from its achievements \\nand face emerging challenges. Our goals must meet the \\nexpectations of post-conflict societies and peoples. In \\nthat regard, I welcome the recent decision to include \\nLiberia on the Commission’s agenda. \\n We also need to overcome the systemic \\nfragmentation that has gradually developed since the \\nestablishment of the Organization and enhance system-\\nwide coherence. An important step in that direction \\nwas taken this year with the establishment of the \\nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \\nEmpowerment of Women (UN Women). I would like to \\nwarmly welcome the appointment of Ms. Michelle \\nBachelet as head of UN Women. I have no doubt that  \\n \\nshe will demonstrate a dynamic and unwavering \\ncommitment to serve women and girls worldwide. She \\nwill be able to rely on the full support of my country, \\nwhich has for many years pursued an integrated gender \\napproach and an active policy of promoting gender \\nequality, including in the area of development \\ncooperation. \\n As you rightly pointed out, Sir, when you were \\nelected to the presidency on 11 June (see A/64/PV.93), \\nour primary task is to work together to find \\nconstructive solutions for the dignity, safety and \\nsecurity and well-being of all. My country is ready to \\ncontinue to play its part at the national level, but also \\nas a member of the European Union. The willingness \\nof Luxembourg to assume its national responsibilities \\ncan be seen in the concrete examples that I have just \\ngiven. It is also expressed in our bid for a non-\\npermanent seat in the Security Council for the period \\n2013 to 2014. \\n The commitment of Luxembourg is also a \\nEuropean one, as I have just said. By strengthening its \\ncapabilities and the increased synergy of its \\ninstruments following the entry into force of the \\nLisbon Treaty, the European Union is now more than \\never ready to be an active, effective and supportive \\nactor for the United Nations in all areas in which the \\nOrganization is active. The European Union wants to \\nbe such an active and supportive partner. Hence the \\nimportance we attach to a resolution regulating the \\neffective participation of the European Union in the \\nwork of our Organization. It is only together in the \\nUnited Nations that we can help build a better future \\nfor all. ', 'The tragic \\nearthquake in Haiti, the devastating floods in Pakistan \\nand the financial crisis have reminded us that the \\nglobal challenges of the twenty-first century require \\nconcerted action. The United Nations needs to be at the \\ncentre of our activities. It is the forum of today’s \\nmultilateral system that enjoys the highest degree of \\nlegitimacy. Inclusiveness is its key comparative \\nadvantage. \\n However, this moral authority must be matched \\nby mechanisms and resources to ensure its \\neffectiveness. Adherence to the rule of law is \\nfundamental. All multilateral efforts and activities need \\n \\n \\n23 10-55109 \\n \\nto operate on the basis of clear and predictable rules \\nthat apply equally to all Member States. Member \\nStates, as well as men and women around the globe, \\nmust be able to trust in the United Nations capacity to \\nturn the promises of the Charter into reality. \\n Cooperation with other international actors is \\nindispensable to the United Nations efforts to deal with \\nthe complex challenges of today. Austria and the \\nEuropean Union (EU) stand ready as reliable partners \\nfor the United Nations in areas ranging from \\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian aid to the \\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to \\npromoting the respect for the rule of law and human \\nrights. In this context, we hope that our initiative to \\nobtain modalities for the EU’s participation in the \\nGeneral Assembly, reflecting the changes provided for \\nin the Treaty of Lisbon, will soon be adopted. This \\nwould greatly help to reinforce the productive \\npartnership of the United Nations with an organization \\nthat is fully committed to the principles and objectives \\nenshrined in the Charter. Austria is proud to contribute \\nto the work of the United Nations by hosting the \\nUnited Nations Office at Vienna. We will continue to \\noffer Vienna as a platform for dialogue and \\ncooperation. \\n In our view, good governance is an inherent \\nelement of global governance. The Vienna-based \\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is central to \\nthe United Nations efforts to combat corruption and \\norganized crime by supporting Member States in \\nimplementing international standards, including the \\nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption. \\nCorruption presents one of the major challenges with \\ndire consequences for the international community’s \\nefforts to reduce poverty. The recent founding of the \\nInternational Anti-Corruption Academy in Austria is an \\nimportant step towards addressing this challenge. That \\ninstitution aims to provide a tool for research, \\neducation and training for professionals from all fields, \\nincluding law enforcement officials, judges and \\nprosecutors. \\n The fight against climate change is one of the \\ncentral issues of the twenty-first century. Climate \\nchange has a far-reaching impact on the economic and \\nsocial development of the entire international \\ncommunity. We need global consensus now if we want \\nto achieve the goal to limit global warming to 2°C and \\nto reverse the trend of rising greenhouse gas emissions \\nby 2020. Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of \\nthis task. However, the fight against climate change is \\nalso an opportunity. We have the chance to create a \\nframework for sustainable, qualitative growth at the \\nglobal level. Austria is committed to contributing to \\nthis endeavour. \\n This week, leaders agreed on concrete actions to \\nget the Millennium Development Goals back on track \\nin the fight against world poverty. We now need to \\nmobilize all our efforts to live up to this renewed \\ncommitment, particularly in addressing the special \\nneeds of Africa in this regard. The Governments of \\ndeveloping and developed countries, as well as the \\nprivate sector and civil society, need to work together \\nto achieve our ambitious goals by 2015. \\n Let me now turn to one of the most urgent threats \\nto peace and security. These days, our attention is \\nfocused on the recently initiated direct talks between \\nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. We \\nwelcome the leadership and commitment of President \\nObama, who made this development possible. These \\ntalks offer the first concrete prospects for a sustainable \\npeace in the Middle East in many years. An agreement \\nbetween Israel and Palestine would not only radically \\nimprove the lives of the peoples concerned, but would \\nalso provide the key to a more stable region and a more \\npeaceful world. We hope that both sides are aware of \\ntheir enormous responsibilities. \\n The process is still fragile. We believe that the \\nextension of the settlement moratorium is fundamental \\nto keeping the talks on track and creating an \\nenvironment in which the core issues can be tackled \\nsuccessfully. It is equally important that the efforts of \\nthe Palestinian authorities to build up functioning \\ninstitutions for a future Palestinian State move forward \\ndynamically. It is ultimately up to the parties to bring \\nthe peace process to a positive conclusion. However, \\ninternational actors, in particular the members of the \\nQuartet, have an important role to play. As a member \\nof the European Union, Austria is ready to fully play \\nits part. \\n In order to ensure that the United Nations \\ncontinues to play a central role in global governance, \\nwe must continue with our efforts towards internal \\nreform of the United Nations, including the reform of \\nthe Security Council. Both an enlargement of the \\nSecurity Council that reflects today’s political, \\neconomic and social realities and a reform of the \\nCouncil’s working methods will enhance the Council’s \\n  \\n \\n10-55109 24 \\n \\nlegitimacy and the acceptance of its decisions. As an \\nelected member of the Security Council, we participate \\nin its work with great commitment and are doing our \\nbest to promote effectiveness and transparency. \\n Significant efforts are under way to ensure and \\nsustain United Nations peacekeeping as an essential \\ntool for achieving the goals of the United Nations. \\nConfronted with limited financial and human resources \\nand the increasing complexity of peacekeeping \\noperations, the United Nations has started a review of \\nthe whole United Nations peacekeeping system with a \\nview to adjusting it to the needs of the twenty-first \\ncentury. It is of vital importance for the Council to \\neffectively monitor and oversee the implementation of \\npeacekeeping mandates, in close cooperation with \\ntroop and police contributors, the Secretariat and \\nUnited Nations missions. Austria fully supports the \\nongoing peacekeeping reform and stands ready to play \\nits part in a renewed global peacekeeping partnership. \\n We also have to work on making peace \\nconsolidation irreversible. The United Nations \\nPeacebuilding Commission, together with integrated \\npeacebuilding support offices, has a key role in \\nfostering sustainable peace. If we use the \\npeacebuilding architecture optimally, lasting peace can \\nbe achieved with determination and the political will of \\nthe country concerned, as well as the support of the \\ninternational community. Since peacekeeping and \\npeacebuilding must be approached in an integrated \\nmanner, we strongly support the enhanced interaction \\nof the Security Council with the Peacebuilding \\nCommission throughout the conflict cycle, as was \\naffirmed at the Security Council summit this week. \\n Due to the changing nature of conflict and an \\nincrease in the activities of non-State actors, the \\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict constitutes a \\ncore task of a large number of United Nations \\npeacekeeping missions. The effective protection of \\nthose affected by hostilities and violence has become a \\nyardstick for the success and credibility of United \\nNations missions in the field and the United Nations at \\nlarge. Security Council resolution 1894 (2009), \\nunanimously adopted in November last year, was a \\nmajor step forward in the Council’s efforts to better \\nprotect civilians from physical violence, displacement \\nand violations of their rights. \\n However, resolution 1894 (2009) has not yet had \\nits full impact on the ground. Violations of \\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law and \\nimpunity for such crimes continue to pose a major \\nthreat to the rule of law and lasting peace in post-\\nconflict situations. \\n Austria acknowledges the primary responsibility \\nof States to ensure the protection of civilians, including \\nthe credible prosecution of those responsible for war \\ncrimes, genocide, crimes against humanity or other \\nserious violations of international law. We support the \\nuse and promotion of mechanisms such as the \\nInternational Criminal Court, commissions of inquiry \\nor panels of experts. Such tools should be seen as a \\nviable complement and reinforcement of steps taken at \\nthe national level to ensure accountability. The \\nSecurity Council has a central role in this endeavour. \\nEnsuring the implementation of resolution 1894 (2009) \\nwill be one of the key priorities of Austria during the \\nremainder of its term on the Council. \\n Austria also attaches utmost importance to \\nenhancing the role of women in conflict and post-\\nconflict situations. Even 10 years after the adoption of \\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women \\nand peace and security, we can still witness major gaps. \\nWomen continue to be largely absent from peace \\nprocesses and conflict-resolution efforts, and crimes \\nagainst them all too often remain unpunished. The \\nlatest, shocking mass rapes in the Eastern Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo demonstrate more than ever that \\nthere is urgent need for action. We cannot afford to \\nignore those gaps. The occasion of the tenth \\nanniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) \\nwill therefore provide a crucial opportunity to work \\ntowards more consistent implementation in promoting \\nwomen’s issues in all aspects of international peace \\nefforts. Those efforts are fully supported by our \\ndevelopment cooperation. \\n Austria warmly welcomes the milestone decision \\nof the General Assembly to establish UN Women, \\nwhich will make the United Nations a stronger and \\nmore effective partner in the advancement of women \\nworldwide. We look forward to working with Michelle \\nBachelet towards our common goals. \\n Children in armed conflict deserve special \\nprotection. I am very satisfied that the United Nations \\nsystem has made concrete progress in combating \\nserious child rights violations and in fighting the \\nrecruitment and enlisting of child soldiers. \\n \\n \\n25 10-55109 \\n \\n Austria reiterates the pivotal role of the United \\nNations at the centre of our counter-terrorism efforts. \\nRespect for human rights and the rule of law is a \\nfundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. As \\nChair of the Security Council Committee established \\npursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-\\nQaida and the Taliban, Austria is committed to \\nenhancing due process in the Council’s sanctions \\nregimes. We therefore welcome the substantial \\nimprovements of the listing and de-listing procedures \\nand the recent appointment of Ms. Kimberly Prost as \\nOmbudsperson. \\n The Austrian candidature for the Human Rights \\nCouncil for the period 2011-2014 is a logical \\ncontinuation of our long-term work and engagement in \\nensuring the respect for human rights, including in the \\nSecurity Council. Dialogue and partnerships are crucial \\nfor turning the promises of the Universal Declaration \\nof Human Rights into a reality for all people around \\nthe globe. Austria has consistently worked with all \\nactors towards narrowing the gap between standards \\nand their implementation at the national and \\ninternational levels. \\n To end on a positive note, this past year saw the \\nmost positive developments towards nuclear \\ndisarmament in a decade. Security Council resolution \\n1887 (2009), adopted just a year ago, provided a \\npowerful impetus. Although many issues are still \\nunresolved and require our close attention, the Review \\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May \\nproduced an outcome that restored confidence in the \\nTreaty. For the first time, a comprehensive action plan \\ndealing with all three pillars of the Treaty was agreed. \\nLet me stress here that Austria is honoured to have \\ncontributed to that success. For the first time, a world \\nwithout nuclear weapons was accepted as the goal of \\nall parties, who pledged to ultimately eliminate all \\ntypes of nuclear weapons. For the first time, the \\ncatastrophic humanitarian consequences of the use of \\nsuch weapons were recognized — an important step \\ntowards the eventual legal ban of nuclear weapons by \\nmeans of a nuclear weapons convention or framework \\nof legal instruments. \\n Although the results of the Conference are \\npositive, much remains to be done. The action plan \\nneeds to be implemented. The nuclear-weapon \\nStates — which promised to engage among themselves \\non a number of vital issues and report by 2014 — must \\nlead by example. The international disarmament \\nstructures must be reformed. I am grateful for \\nSecretary-General Ban’s initiative in this respect. \\n Finally, we must learn from successful \\ndisarmament initiatives. Let me underline that Austria \\nis delighted that the Convention on Cluster Munitions \\nentered into force last month. The Convention is a \\npositive example of how committed Governments, \\ninternational organizations and civil society can work \\ntogether to achieve real progress. In order to promote \\ninteraction in this respect in the nuclear field as well, \\nAustria supports the establishment of a competence \\ncentre for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in \\nVienna early next year. Conceived as a platform for \\nopen discussion and independent expertise, monitoring \\nand advocacy, the centre shall facilitate understanding \\nand cooperation among all entities involved. I hope \\nthat it will contribute to further progress in nuclear \\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \\n We, the United Nations, have shared \\nresponsibility to move forward jointly in order to reach \\nour common goal of international peace, security and \\ndevelopment for all. ', 'Luxembourg is very pleased that the President of the \\nEuropean Council, Herman Van Rompuy, was able for \\nthe first time to address this Assembly on behalf of the \\nEuropean Union (see ), and I align myself \\nfully with his statement. \\n Never before has the United Nations been so \\nindispensable; never before have expectations of it \\nbeen so great. We are going through a period of great \\nturbulence; a period, as the Secretary-General has said, \\nburdened by great difficulties, but also rich in \\nopportunity for the progress of humankind. It is our \\nduty to respond to the expectations placed on us by all \\nthose across the world who seek peace, security and \\ndignity. \\n On 9 July 2011 a new State was born before the \\neyes of the entire world. In January, during their \\nreferendum on independence, the people of South \\nSudan spoke loudly and clearly. More than 98 per cent \\nof the electorate voted for the independence to which \\nthe southern part of Africa’s largest country had \\naspired for so long. Luxembourg is proud to have \\nrecognized South Sudan on 9 July, even before the \\nhistoric moment of its admission to the United Nations. \\n The independence of South Sudan is a testament \\nto the willingness of the two parties in the long \\nSudanese conflict to implement the Comprehensive \\nPeace Agreement. It is now up to both parties to show \\nthe same willingness to implement new agreements to \\naddress the issues of good-neighbourly relations \\nbetween the Sudan and South Sudan. The two Sudans, \\nand their peoples first of all, will benefit if the \\nrelationship finally becomes a constructive one, \\nallowing for socio-economic development on a new \\nbasis.  \\n The international community stands ready to \\nsupport both countries. The development of the Sudan \\nand support of the new State of South Sudan on its path \\nto viability, stability and prosperity are tasks that we \\nmust all tackle together and cooperatively. The \\nEuropean Union is actively engaged. Luxembourg fully \\nsupports its efforts and is also committed bilaterally, \\nparticularly regarding demining activities to help \\nremove the vestiges of a war that was so long that it \\nhas marked several generations of Sudanese. \\n A few days ago, in recognizing the full powers of \\nLibya’s National Transitional Council, the Assembly \\nblessed, in a way, the end of Colonel Al-Qadhafi’s \\ndictatorial regime, one that suffocated the whole of \\nLibyan society for 42 years and did not hesitate to use \\n  \\n \\n11-51378 2 \\n \\nheavy weapons against its own population without \\ndiscrimination, trampling on its people’s aspirations for \\nfreedom. \\n The international community had to react, to \\nassume its responsibility to protect Libyan men, \\nwomen and children who were under fire — and who, \\nunfortunately, are still under fire in Sirte and Bani \\nWalid. We did not want to reproach ourselves yet again \\nfor having hesitated too long, for having neglected our \\nresponsibility to protect those unable to defend \\nthemselves against the cruelty of their own authorities. \\nWe did not want once again to be the powerless \\nwitnesses of large-scale violence.  \\n Our Organization was able to react and \\ndemonstrate its capacity to act in a decisive, timely and \\njust manner. The General Assembly suspended Libya \\nfrom the Human Rights Council. Acting within the \\nremit of Chapter VII of the Charter, the Security \\nCouncil authorized all measures necessary to protect \\nthe population and civilian areas under threat of attack. \\nThe Council was able to act so decisively because the \\ninternational community, and the region in particular, \\nsupported its action. The Arab League played a very \\nimportant role in this regard, which I heartily \\ncommend. \\n Today, thanks to their courage and the resolute \\nsupport of the international community, the Libyan \\npeople are free to choose their future. Together with \\nour European Union partners, we stand ready to \\nsupport Libya on its path to democracy and to help the \\nNational Transitional Council in its immense task of \\nestablishing a new State, in which human rights are \\nrespected and every element of society can find a \\nplace. As Mr. Jean Ping, who was President of the \\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, put it so \\nwell in Paris on 1 September, Africa will benefit \\nenormously from the emergence of a democratic Libya, \\nat peace with itself and with its neighbours. We will all \\nbenefit from it. \\n In Tunisia and in Egypt, the people have also \\nprevailed in their quests for liberty and the rewriting of \\nthe social contract, in the face of the supporters of their \\nformer regimes. In other countries in the region, people \\nmust, alas, continue to struggle to achieve respect for \\ntheir fundamental freedoms.  \\n In Syria, the regime continues to conduct a brutal \\ncampaign against its own population. Every appeal, \\nincluding that of the Secretary-General, to end the \\nviolence and repression has so far remained \\nunanswered. As the Human Rights Council on \\n23 August decided, commendably, to send urgently an \\nindependent international commission of inquiry to \\nSyria, the Security Council should also assume its \\nresponsibility in the matter. The credibility of the \\nUnited Nations as a moral force, one that protects \\ncivilian populations and their rights, is at stake. \\nEqually at stake is the capacity of the United Nations \\nto be present in crises, revolts and disasters that assault \\npeoples’ dignity and threaten their very existence. \\n Peace, security, dignity — these are also key \\nwords when we talk about the Israeli-Palestinian \\nconflict: the right of two peoples to live in peace, \\nsecurity and dignity.  \\n A solution to this conflict, which has lasted too \\nlong and has poisoned the entire region, must \\nnecessarily be reached through the recognition of the \\nright of both parties — not just one of them — to live \\nin a sovereign and viable State. This is unfortunately \\nnot yet the case, despite the hope inspired by the \\ncourageous words of President Obama at this very \\nrostrum last year (see A/65/PV.11). On the contrary, we \\nhave seen neither a halt to the illegal construction of \\nsettlements, nor a significant lifting of the embargo on \\nthe Gaza strip. The revival of direct peace talks was \\nshort-lived. \\n We all heard Palestinian President Mahmoud \\nAbbas’s vibrant appeal yesterday, his call for \\nrecognition of the his people’s legitimate right to a \\nState and for acceptance of the aspirations of Palestine \\nto have a seat in the Assembly and to fully assume its \\nplace among the nations of the world. I can only hope \\nthat his appeal will be heard. Israel’s legitimate desire \\nto live for the long term in security depends on the \\nrealization of the right of the Palestinians to live in \\ndignity in their sovereign State. \\n But merely responding to this appeal is not \\nenough. It is imperative that negotiations between the \\ntwo parties start again as soon as possible. Only \\nnegotiations will allow tackling the root causes of the \\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. The parameters for a \\nsettlement have been known for a long time. I fully \\nsupport the proposal made yesterday by the Quartet for \\na strict timetable: one month to agree on the agenda \\nand modalities of the negotiations, and no more than a \\nyear to reach a comprehensive agreement.  \\n \\n \\n3 11-51378 \\n \\n I appeal to the parties to show proof of their \\npolitical will and ability to make the necessary \\ncompromises and sacrifices so that by the end of 2012 \\npeace in the Middle East finally becomes a reality. \\nFrom this rostrum, I reiterate firmly that the restart of \\nnegotiations cannot again stumble over cement and \\nstones, and I dare believe that the Israeli Government \\nknows that. In their efforts both now and in the future, \\nthe parties can count on the nations of the European \\nUnion, including my country, Luxembourg. \\n The events over the past year in North Africa, the \\nMiddle East and sub-Saharan Africa remind us of the \\nimportance of a United Nations Organization with solid \\nmeans for prevention and mediation, for peacekeeping \\nand peacebuilding. Conflict prevention is one of the \\nprincipal obligations set out in the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations. Primary responsibility for that belongs \\nto Member States, but no State can act alone. Each \\nmust be able to count on the support of the rest.  \\n At the 2005 World Summit, we all committed to \\npromoting a culture of prevention, and we put in place \\nimportant new tools and mechanisms. The \\nPeacebuilding Commission, by uniting all concerned \\nactors and formulating integrated strategies, is an \\nessential element of these. \\n My country is deeply convinced of the relevance \\nof a broad and multidimensional approach to \\npeacebuilding. Luxembourg is proud to be an active \\ncontributor to the work of the Peacebuilding \\nCommission, notably as Chair of the country-specific \\nconfiguration for Guinea established this February. Our \\npriority is to support the authorities in Conakry in the \\nareas of national reconciliation, security sector reform \\nand employment for women and young people. Since \\n2010 Luxembourg, in its national capacity, has been \\nsupporting mediation conducted by the Community of \\nSant’Egidio between the main political and civil \\nsociety actors in Guinea. \\n Both at the bilateral level and in its capacity as a \\nmember of the European Union, Luxembourg sees \\nconflict prevention and providing support in post-\\nconflict situations as being at the heart of its activity \\nabroad, primarily through multilateral instruments, \\nwith the United Nations, naturally, first and foremost \\namong them. The challenges we face are not limited to \\npolitical conflicts but also concern economic, social \\nand environmental transformation.  \\n Let us remember that the Arab Spring began with \\nan act of social protest. We therefore agree entirely \\nwith the priority that the President intends to give \\nduring his mandate to sustainable development, \\npoverty eradication and achievement of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. \\n With our European Union partners, we will do \\neverything in our power to contribute ensuring that the \\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \\nDevelopment (Rio+20), which will take place in Brazil \\nless than a year from now, in June 2012, is truly \\nsuccessful. Rio+20 must set a range of ambitious goals \\nthat will ensure that we stay on track with sustainable \\ndevelopment and preserve future generations’ ability to \\nlive on our planet.  \\n Sustainable development, in its three elements — \\neconomic, social and environmental — has long been \\nat the centre of Luxembourg’s development \\ncooperation policy. I am happy to say that Luxembourg \\nhas managed to maintain and even increase its efforts \\nin terms of official development assistance, which in \\n2010 reached 1.09 per cent of our gross national \\nproduct. \\n We no longer need to prove the close link \\nbetween security and development. For Luxembourg, \\nthe links between security and climate change are \\nequally obvious. As the Secretary-General observed, \\nclimate change must be seen as a threat multiplier. \\nLuxembourg’s commitment to combating climate \\nchange, including through the Group of Friends created \\nhere in New York for that purpose, is also part of our \\nstrategy for preventing conflicts before climate change \\nmakes them worse. In that context, my country offers \\nsupport and technical assistance to small island \\ndeveloping States, particularly those in the Pacific, \\nwhose existence is threatened by climate change. \\n Since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, \\nLuxembourg, together with its European partners, has \\nmade binding commitments to reduce its carbon \\nemissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. \\nLuxembourg is also contributing to the fast start \\nfinance initiative in order to tackle climate change. I \\nshould stress that these resources are new and \\nadditional to our official development assistance. \\n Among the numerous other challenges that \\nrequire a coordinated and collective response, I should \\nlike to mention one in particular: the prevention and \\ncontrol of non-communicable diseases. Non-communicable \\n  \\n \\n11-51378 4 \\n \\ndiseases not only cost 36 million human lives every year; \\nthey also result in significant losses to national revenue \\nand pull millions of people below the poverty line. \\nThey affect all of us and are having an increasingly \\npreponderant impact on developing countries. The \\nresponse to this challenge of epidemic proportions \\nmust be global and universal. \\n I therefore commend the initiative on the part of \\nthe Caribbean Community countries to put this subject \\non the General Assembly’s agenda and to publicize, \\nbeyond the medical community, the scope and impact \\nof the crisis in non-communicable diseases, including \\nin development terms. There is no question that the \\ndebate in the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and \\nControl of Non-communicable Diseases, the round \\ntables and the various side events held in the last few \\ndays have allowed us to reach that goal. We should \\nnow fully implement the commitments undertaken in \\nthe Political Declaration (resolution 66/2, annex). I can \\nassure the Assembly that Luxembourg will continue its \\nefforts to that end at the national, regional and \\ninternational levels. \\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, \\nwhose tenth anniversary we have just commemorated, \\nwere attacks against not only the United States, the \\nhost country of our Organization, but against all of us, \\nagainst our values and principles, our convictions and \\nbeliefs. Our Organization itself has become the target \\nof cowardly attacks. Such despicable acts must not, \\nhowever, lead us to turn inward. On the contrary, they \\nshould encourage us to redouble efforts to continue to \\nact together in furthering the ideals and values of our \\nOrganization and its Charter, to fight together against \\nterrorism and for a better and safer future for \\ngenerations to come, for development and respect for \\nhuman rights, for democracy and the rule of law. That \\nis our joint responsibility: the responsibility to prevent, \\nto preserve and to protect. \\n Luxembourg stands ready to shoulder its \\nresponsibilities and to continue to work for an effective \\nmultilateralism, including — if the Assembly affords \\nus the opportunity — as a non-permanent member of \\nthe Security Council in 2013-2014.', 'When we \\nmet in this very place in September last year, who \\namong us could have imagined that in barely one year \\nthe world, already shaken by an unprecedented \\neconomic crisis, would undergo such change? Within a \\nfew months, the Arab Spring gave rise to immense \\nhope. \\n The Arab peoples, too long crushed by \\noppression, were able to raise their heads and claimed \\nthe right to be free at last. They fought back against the \\nviolence and brutality with their bare hands. To those \\nwho proclaimed that the Arab Muslim world was by \\nnature hostile to democracy and human rights, the \\nyoung Arabs produced the most cogent denial. \\n We do not have the right to disappoint the hope of \\nthe Arab peoples. We do not have the right to destroy \\ntheir dreams. For shattering the dreams of those \\npeoples would vindicate the fanatics who have not \\nstopped pitting Islam against the West by stirring up \\nhatred and violence everywhere. \\n That appeal for justice shook the world, and the \\nworld cannot respond to that call for justice by \\nperpetuating an injustice. That miraculous spring of the \\n \\n \\n23 11-50692 \\n \\nArab peoples imposes on us the moral and political \\nobligation at last to find a solution to the Middle East \\nconflict. We cannot wait any longer. The method used \\nto date — I weigh my words carefully — has failed. So \\nwe must change the method. \\n We must stop believing that a single country — \\nwhether the largest or a small group of countries — can \\nresolve so complex a problem. Too many large actors \\nhave been sidelined for our efforts to succeed. I mean \\nthat no one can believe that the peace process can \\nsucceed without Europe, without all the permanent \\nmembers of the Security Council and without the Arab \\nStates that have already chosen peace. A collective \\napproach has become indispensable in order to create \\ntrust and to provide guarantees to each of the parties. \\n Peace will indeed be made by the Israelis and the \\nPalestinians, and by no one else. No one can expect to \\nimpose it on them. But we must help them.  \\n The method no longer works. Let us together \\nacknowledge that setting preconditions for negotiation \\nis to condemn ourselves to failure. Preconditions are \\nthe opposite of negotiation. If we wish to enter into \\nnegotiation, which is the only possible path for peace, \\nthere must be no preconditions. \\n Let us change the method. All the elements of a \\nsolution are known — the Madrid Conference of 1991, \\nPresident Obama’s speech of 19 May, the Road Map, \\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the parameters agreed by \\nthe European Union. So, let us stop endlessly \\ndiscussing the parameters and allow negotiation to \\nbegin in line with a concrete and ambitious timetable. \\nSixty years without one centimetre’s progress — does \\nthat not compel us to change the method and time \\nframe to one month to resume discussions, six months \\nto reach agreement on borders and security, and one \\nyear to reach a definitive settlement? \\n As of this autumn, France proposes hosting a \\ndonor conference so that the Palestinians can complete \\nthe construction of their future State. France wishes to \\nsay that we must not immediately seek the perfect \\nsolution, because there are no perfect solutions. Let us \\nchoose the path of compromise, which is neither \\nrenunciation nor repudiation, but which allows us to \\nmove forward, step by step. \\n Thus, for 60 years the Palestinians have been \\nwaiting for their State. Has the time not come to give \\nthem hope? For 60 years, Israel has suffered from not \\nbeing able to live in peace. For 60 years, the question \\nof the peaceful coexistence of the two peoples — \\nPalestinian and Israeli — has continued to fester. We \\ncan no longer wait to take the path of peace. Let us put \\nourselves in the place of the Palestinians. Is it not \\nlegitimate that they claim their State? Of course it is. \\nAnd who does not see that creating a democratic, \\nviable and peaceful Palestinian State would be, for \\nIsrael, the best guarantee of its security? \\n Let us put ourselves in the place of the Israelis. Is \\nit not legitimate that, after 60 years of war and attacks, \\nthey demand guarantees of that peace, so long awaited? \\nOf course it is. I say that forcefully. If anyone \\nanywhere in the world were to threaten the existence of \\nIsrael, France would immediately and wholeheartedly \\nstand alongside Israel. Threats made against a State \\nMember of the United Nations are unacceptable, and \\nthey will not be accepted. \\n Today, we are facing a very difficult choice. Each \\nof us knows — and let us stop with hypocrisy and one-\\noff diplomacy — that full recognition of the status of a \\nState Member of the United Nations cannot be attained \\nat once. The first reason for that is the lack of trust \\nbetween the main parties. But let us tell the truth: who \\ncan doubt that a veto in the Security Council will \\nengender a cycle of violence in the Middle East? Who \\ncan doubt that? \\n Must we therefore exclude an intermediate stage? \\nWhy not envisage offering Palestine the status of \\nUnited Nations Observer State? That would be an \\nimportant step forward. After 60 years of immobility, \\nwhich has paved the way for extremists, we would be \\ngiving hope to the Palestinians by making progress \\ntowards final status. \\n To show their determined commitment to a \\nnegotiated peace, the Palestinian authorities should, as \\npart of that approach, reaffirm Israel’s right to exist \\nand to its security. They should commit to avoiding \\nusing this new status to resort to actions that are \\nincompatible with the pursuit of negotiations. \\n We have but one alternative — immobility and \\nnegotiations that go nowhere or an intermediate \\nsolution that would give hope to the Palestinians with \\nthe status of an Observer State.  \\n In parallel, Israel must observe the same restraint. \\nIt must abstain from any actions that would prejudge \\nthe final status.  \\n  \\n \\n11-50692 24 \\n \\n The ultimate goal must be mutual recognition of \\ntwo nation-States for two peoples established on the \\nbasis of the 1967 lines with agreed and equivalent \\nexchanges of land.  \\n The General Assembly, which has a power to do \\nso, should decide to move ahead, leave behind the fatal \\ntrap of paralysis, missed appointments and short-lived \\nattempts to relaunch the process. Let us change our \\napproach. Let us change our state of mind. Each should \\ntry to understand the reasoning, sufferings and fears of \\nthe other. Each must open its eyes and be ready to \\nmake concessions. \\n In conclusion, I would like to say to the \\nPalestinian people with the deep and sincere friendship \\nI hold for them: “Think of the Israeli mothers grieving \\nfor their family members killed in terrorist attacks. \\nThey feel the same pain as the Palestinian mothers \\nconfronted with the brutal death of one of theirs”. \\n I would like to say to the Israeli people with the \\ndeep and sincere friendship I hold for them: “Listen to \\nwhat the young people of the Arab Spring are saying: \\n‘Long live freedom!’ They are not crying ‘Down with \\nIsrael’. You cannot remain immobile when this wind of \\nfreedom and democracy is blowing in your region”. \\n I say with deep and sincere friendship for these \\ntwo peoples who have suffered so much that the time \\nhas come to build peace for the children of Palestine \\nand for the children of Israel. But it would be a great \\nshame if the General Assembly did not seize the \\nopportunity of the reawakening of the Arab peoples to \\ndemocracy to settle a problem that brings unhappiness \\nto these two peoples, who are in any event condemned \\nto live alongside each other. If we take a compromise \\nsolution, we will rebuild trust and we will give people \\nhope. \\n I say that with the utmost gravity to the \\nrepresentatives of all nations. We must assume an \\nhistoric responsibility. It is the General Assembly of \\nthe United Nations that must keep this appointment \\nwith History. \\n Let us reassure Israel and give hope to the \\nPalestinian people. The solution is on the table. Let us \\ntake this compromise solution over deadlock. Deadlock \\nmight satisfy everyone here, but it will create violence, \\nbitterness and opposition that will imperil the \\nresurgence of the Arab peoples. To that, France says \\nthat the tragedy must cease for a simple reason: it has \\ngone on for too long. \\n', 'Twelve months ago, I \\nstood here and insisted upon the importance of the \\nprinciple of accountability. This year there is even \\nmore reason to underscore this core value in national \\nand international politics. \\n In several countries of the Arab world — in \\nTunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Syria, Yemen and \\nelsewhere — people are transforming the outlook of \\ntheir societies, moving towards more accountable \\nleadership. \\n On the African continent, in Côte d’Ivoire a \\nleader who repeatedly plunged his country into \\nviolence did not stand the test of democratic \\nlegitimacy. With parliamentary elections scheduled to \\ntake place later this year, Côte d’Ivoire is now ready to \\nmake a fresh start. \\n And in Europe the arrest of Ratko Mladic \\nconfirms what leaders should know all too well: that \\nwar crimes will not remain unpunished for ever, that \\nthis world will not accept impunity. \\n The past year has shown that, more than ever, \\nhistory is on the side of those who, worldwide, strive \\nfor more accountability. They will find Belgium on \\ntheir side. \\n Accountability means first of all legal \\naccountability: the obligation to implement \\ninternational treaties and to respect international law. A \\nformer Nuremberg prosecutor, Benjamin Ferencz, \\nstated, “There can be no peace without justice, no \\njustice without law and no meaningful law without a \\nCourt to decide what is just and lawful under any given \\ncircumstance”. \\n Some of the examples I have just mentioned \\nillustrate that all too well. Ratko Mladic is on trial in \\nThe Hague. Mass atrocities committed in Côte d’Ivoire \\nand Libya have been referred to the International \\nCriminal Court. \\n From this place, I would like to launch a strong \\nappeal to those Member States that have not yet done \\nso to adhere to and shoulder the Rome Statute, as a \\ncontribution to a sustainable and accountable \\ninternational legal system. \\n But accountability is of course much broader. It \\nalso implies political accountability. Governments, \\n \\n \\n5 11-51378 \\n \\npoliticians and civil servants are accountable and \\nresponsible to their citizens, be it through the ballot \\nbox or through constructive engagement with \\nrepresentative organizations. \\n Let me be frank: this is also a challenge in the \\ncontinent I come from, Europe. We, as European \\nleaders, should not run away from the obligation of \\nbeing accountable to the people we represent. In the \\nDurban spirit of non-discrimination, let me add: \\naccountable to all the people, regardless of their ethnic \\nbackground, their religion or belief, their gender, \\nsexual orientation or social position. \\n Worldwide, the challenges are sometimes of a \\ndifferent order. Let us be clear. Leaders who believe \\nthat they can cling to power through terror and \\nsuppression make a cruel mistake. Leaders who believe \\nthat pointing guns at their own people, that sending \\ndeath squads on to the streets, that stoning women to \\ndeath is acceptable, have lost touch with humankind \\nand are bound to lose all support, not only from their \\nown people but also from the world. \\n Warlords who think that they can get away with \\nsexual abuse of women and recruiting child soldiers \\nshould be stopped and held accountable by a united \\nand firm international community. \\n Belgium will not stand idly by when people claim \\na future free of coercion and terror. Instead of \\nnon-interference, Belgium believes in non-indifference. \\nSovereignty cannot be a wall that leaders can use to \\nviolate the rights of their citizens. Sovereignty cannot \\nbe used as an excuse to run away from the \\nresponsibility to protect their people. \\n This is one of the main lessons that I draw from \\nrecent events in the Arab world: that democracy and \\naccountability are of a universal nature; that they \\ncannot be claimed, and should not be claimed, by any \\nnation or group of nations. \\n Take the case of Libya, where the Security \\nCouncil was able to prevent a massacre in Benghazi. \\nBelgium decided, with almost unanimous support in \\nParliament, to take part in the military Operation \\nUnified Protector, assuming the risk and the cost.  \\n That was because Belgium is convinced that the \\ninternational community has the responsibility to take \\naction when populations are exposed to imminent \\ndanger. Molière said long ago that we are responsible \\nnot only for what we do, but for what we do not do.  \\n Today, now that the immediate danger is fading, \\nthe international community has a responsibility to \\nhelp in the reconstruction of Libya. Let us not forget \\nthat that responsibility is an integral part of the \\nresponsibility to protect. Belgium will contribute.  \\n Let us look at the rest of the African continent, \\nwhose peoples want their voice to be heard through \\nfree and fair elections. In that context, I wish to make \\nspecific mention of the Democratic Republic of the \\nCongo, where, after years of violence, undeniable \\nprogress has been made.  \\n The important part played by the United Nations, \\nand in particular by the United Nations Organization \\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \\nthe Congo, cannot be ignored.  \\n There are still significant challenges to be \\novercome. They include the continuation and \\nstrengthening of stabilization efforts in the east of \\ncountry, the reform of the security sector, the \\nestablishment of the rule of law and countering \\nimpunity and sexual violence.  \\n Those are essential ingredients in the \\nconsolidation of democracy. The 2006 elections put the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the road to \\ndemocracy. The elections to be held at the end of \\nNovember should confirm that the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo is ready once and for all to \\nmove on from its bloody past.  \\n As an important partner of the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo, my Government is contributing \\nfinancially to the preparations for the elections, and \\ndemands that every candidate and every citizen be able \\nto participate peacefully and with full respect for \\ndemocratic rules.\\n Let us finally look at the Middle East, a conflict \\nregion that has this week received much attention here \\nin the Hall. Dag Hammarskjöld, to whom this week is \\ndedicated and who himself devoted much of his effort \\nto finding a lasting peace in that region, said more than \\nhalf a century ago: “The building of a firm bridge … \\nover which you can pass without any difficulties may \\nbe a long story”. More than 50 years later, we still do \\nnot have such a “firm bridge”. That is not acceptable.  \\n  \\n \\n11-51378 6 \\n \\n The parameters of a sustainable solution are well \\nknown. Both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples have \\nlegitimate aspirations. People want statehood. People \\nwant to live in peace and security. These were the \\nmessages that President Abbas and Prime Minister \\nNetanyahu brought us yesterday. It must be possible to \\nsatisfy both legitimate needs. \\n Over the past few months, the European Union \\nand its High Representative have spared no effort to \\nget a process of negotiations started. There is no \\nalternative to negotiations, however difficult and risky \\nthe path may be. It is therefore my sincere hope that \\nthe steps proposed by the Quartet yesterday will be \\nfully implemented. \\n It is also clear that the Palestinian Authority has \\nsuccessfully progressed on the road to statehood, also \\nthanks to the important and sustained contributions by \\nthe European Union and by Belgium, and that it has \\nnow reached a level of statehood that the world cannot \\nignore. \\n Now is the time to show leadership. After all, that \\nis what accountability towards the people of the region \\nis all about. \\n Many have said it before: the global challenges \\nwe face are multiple. They range from terrorism to \\nclimate change and sustainable development — in \\nwhich regard the upcoming United Nations Conference \\non Sustainable Development will ask a lot of our \\nenergy and creativity in the months ahead; from \\nfinancial turmoil to terrible humanitarian tragedies like \\nthe one in the Horn of Africa; from banning cluster \\nmunitions to curbing nuclear proliferation, notably in \\nNorth Korea and Iran; from guaranteeing the \\nresponsible and transparent exploitation of natural \\nresources through schemes such as the Kimberley \\nProcess; through to fully implementing the indicators \\nof the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 \\n(2000) on women, peace and security. \\n For Belgium, the only way to address those \\nchallenges is through a multilateral approach. No \\ncountry, however big or important, is capable of \\ntackling global challenges alone. No country, however \\nmodest in size it may be, should think that it cannot be \\npart of the solution. \\n Multilateralism is not about blocking solutions. It \\nshould lead to change, and should have at its centre the \\nUnited Nations, which indeed has proved its added \\nvalue in so many fields. Let me mention just one such \\nfield to which Belgium attaches particular importance: \\ninternational conflict mediation. \\n When the Secretary-General addressed us earlier \\nthis week he mentioned Guinea, Kenya and Kyrgyzstan \\nas United Nations mediation successes. The list is \\nundoubtedly longer, but so are the needs. I am \\ntherefore grateful to the President of the General \\nAssembly for choosing mediation as a central theme \\nfor our debate. I strongly believe that the United \\nNations should continue to invest in strengthening its \\nmediation capacities. \\n I am proud to announce that Belgium has decided \\nto financially support the United Nations Mediation \\nSupport Unit and to actively engage with the President \\nand with other Governments and non-governmental \\nstakeholders to strengthen the role of United Nations \\nmediation efforts. \\n Some say that the United Nations is losing its \\npower as a global platform for discussion and decision-\\nmaking. Some say that global trends point towards a \\nmore fragmented structure of global governance. I do \\nnot think that that is true. I would certainly not think \\nthat it was desirable. \\n Belgium remains a staunch supporter of the \\nUnited Nations. Our current engagement in the \\nPeacebuilding Commission and our bid for a \\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \\nperiod 2019-2020 show our willingness to play our role \\nin the United Nations. \\n Today I am also proud to introduce Belgium’s \\ncandidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period \\n2015-2018, to add our voice to those who fight \\nimpunity and discrimination; to give a voice to those \\nmen, women and children who worldwide see their \\nrights curtailed; to turn the principle of non-\\nindifference into a living reality. That is not for the \\nsake of ourselves, but for the sake of those to whom we \\nare accountable.', 'This year has once \\nagain confirmed the importance of the United Nations \\nas the truly indispensable multilateral forum for \\naddressing today’s global problems. The humanitarian \\ncrisis in the Horn of Africa, ecological disasters such \\nas Fukushima, political developments like the Arab \\nSpring and terrorist attacks such as the assault on the \\nUnited Nations building in Abuja last August require \\nconcerted action by the United Nations and its Member \\nStates. Ten years after 9/11, joint action in the fight \\nagainst terrorism continues to remain central on the \\nmultilateral agenda. \\n In the past nine months, we have witnessed \\nmomentous changes in the Arab world that nobody \\nexpected when we met one year ago. Pressure for \\nchange is driven by the wish of women and men to \\nchoose their own fate and to improve their chances for \\na better life. These are legitimate demands. An \\noverwhelming number of young people were at the \\nforefront of this enormous tide, which started in \\nTunisia and Egypt. We should pay tribute to their \\ncourage. \\n In Libya, thousands lost their lives in the struggle \\nfor freedom and democracy. In Syria, and to some \\nextent in Yemen, the suppression is ongoing. Austria \\nstrongly condemns the systematic human rights \\nviolations and the violence against peaceful \\ndemonstrators. We strongly urge those responsible to \\nimmediately stop the bloodshed and to engage in \\nmeaningful dialogue and reforms. Austria supports the \\nLibyan people in its struggle for freedom. Over \\n€150 million blocked in Austrian bank accounts has \\nbeen de-frozen for humanitarian use. Both the Austrian \\nGovernment and private sector have provided \\nmedicine, relief supplies and desperately needed fuel to \\nLibya. \\n The international community and the United \\nNations have to support and assist the transition \\nprocess in the Arab world as the United Nations does \\nnow in Libya. This period of change may last for some \\ntime and will be full of challenges. Austria welcomes \\nall efforts undertaken by Governments in the region for \\npeaceful and credible change. We encourage the newly \\nempowered authorities to create a constitutional \\nframework based on democracy and human rights, in \\norder to fulfil their mandate for democratic change \\nresponsibly and peacefully. \\n The events in the Arab world notwithstanding, we \\nmust continue to focus on the Middle East peace \\nprocess. The Middle East took centre stage this week \\nhere at the General Assembly — and rightly so. We \\nmust build trust and we have to foster the belief among \\nIsraelis and Palestinians that a negotiated settlement \\ncan be achieved — a sustainable solution based on two \\nStates living side by side in a secure and peaceful \\nneighbourhood within mutually recognized borders. \\nWe have no choice but to return to direct negotiations \\nbetween the two parties. The Quartet, in its statement \\nyesterday, has shown a way to do that and has also \\nproposed concrete timelines. Austria fully supports the \\nQuartet statement. There is no time to lose. \\n  \\n \\n11-51372 26 \\n \\n Austria welcomes President Al-Nasser’s choice of \\ntheme for this year’s general debate. We appreciate \\nQatar’s strong track record in that regard.  \\n Last year’s tenth anniversary of the adoption of \\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \\npeace and security reminded us that the promise of \\nwomen’s full and equal participation in all efforts of \\nmaintaining peace and security, including in mediation \\nprocesses, has not yet come true and that we all need to \\nintensify our efforts. \\n In that context, let me also mention an Austrian \\ncontribution to international mediation efforts. By \\ninviting political decision-makers from both Khartoum \\nand Juba to Vienna in recent years, Austria has \\nmanaged to offer the two sides a platform for \\ndiscussion. We are ready to continue to do so. The \\nSudan and South Sudan have a shared past and must \\nresolve their remaining problems peacefully. \\n The United Nations headquarters in Vienna \\nserves as a dynamic hub for the promotion of peace, \\nsecurity and sustainable development. I am proud to \\nannounce that a liaison office of the United Nations \\nOffice for Disarmament Affairs will open in Vienna soon. \\nOver the past year, the International Anti-Corruption \\nAcademy set up its headquarters near Vienna, and the \\nVienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation \\nand an office of the International Peace Institute were \\nestablished. \\n Austria fully stands behind the campaign \\nlaunched by the Secretary-General on Monday to \\nachieve universal access to modern energy services. \\nWe support doubling the rate of improvement in energy \\nefficiency and the share of renewable energy in the \\nglobal energy mix by 2030. Austria provides \\nsubstantial support to the energy and environment \\nefforts undertaken by the United Nations Industrial \\nDevelopment Organization. Last June, we hosted the \\nVienna Energy Forum, where about 1,400 participants \\ndiscussed alternative energy concepts to reach the \\nenergy goals of the United Nations. \\n The Fukushima nuclear catastrophe should \\nbecome a turning point in our approach to nuclear \\nsafety. We owe it to future generations to make safety \\nconcerns come first when using nuclear power. Austria \\ndecided, in 1978, to forgo the use of nuclear energy. \\nSome countries have recently adopted a similar course, \\nwhich we welcome. \\n The last time I spoke at the United Nations, it \\nwas during the thematic debate held in April on the \\nrule of law and global challenges. That was an \\nimportant step in the preparation of the high-level \\nmeeting on the rule of law that will take place in \\nSeptember 2012. Next year’s meeting will provide an \\nimportant opportunity to renew the efforts of both the \\nUnited Nations and Member States to promote the rule \\nof law. As a medium-sized country and as a strong \\nsupporter of multilateralism, Austria attaches particular \\nimportance to the rule of law, including at the \\ninternational level. The international system can only \\nproperly function if it based on clear and predictable \\nrules that apply equally to all Member States. \\n The promotion and protection of human rights is \\na core priority of Austria’s foreign policy. We are proud \\nto serve on the Human Rights Council for the period \\n2011-2014. For our membership in this body, Austria \\nhas identified the following priorities, on which we \\nwill take action. \\n Austria is firmly committed to respect for \\nfreedom of religion and belief. We are deeply troubled \\nby recurring attacks against religious minorities in all \\nparts of the world and among all religions. To foster \\ntolerance, Austria has hosted a number of high-level \\ndialogues between religious and secular leaders over \\nthe past decade. We think that that has become a new \\nand promising field of modern diplomacy, putting the \\nemphasis on conflict prevention. \\n Various forms of child trafficking and \\nexploitation constitute gross violations of children’s \\nrights. As a member of the Human Rights Council, \\nAustria will work to address that issue and to help \\ndevelop counter-strategies. We highly appreciate the \\nwork of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\\nGeneral for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. Radhika \\nCoomaraswamy, and we strongly support the renewal \\nof her mandate. \\n Racism, xenophobia and discrimination on the \\ngrounds of ethnic origin, gender, age, sexual \\norientation and religious belief are ongoing challenges \\nand of concern to all of us. Austria is committed to the \\nfight against those abuses, including anti-Semitism. \\nTherefore, we will continue to press for action, \\nincluding in the framework of the United Nations. We \\nwill also take initiatives during our membership in the \\nHuman Rights Council to strengthen the protection of \\njournalists against all forms of threat and intimidation. \\n \\n \\n27 11-51372 \\n \\n Austria has a 50-year-long track record of \\ncontributing to United Nations peacekeeping \\noperations. And we will continue our engagement. We \\nrecently decided to deploy 160 Austrian troops to the \\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in \\naddition to our continued presence in the United \\nNations Disengagement Observer Force and the United \\nNations Truce Supervision Organization. Through its \\nparticipation in UNIFIL, Austria wishes to make an \\nactive contribution to the maintenance of peace and \\nsecurity not only in Lebanon but in the region as a \\nwhole. \\n Austria welcomes the positive momentum in \\ninternational security policy over the past couple of \\nyears. We salute the Secretary-General’s determined \\nleadership, including his five-point plan on \\ndisarmament. We look forward to continuing our work \\nin this positive spirit at the first meeting of the \\nPreparatory Committee for the Review Conference on \\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons, to be held in Vienna in May of next year. \\nWe, and hope for progress with regard to the \\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \\nMiddle East. \\n Nevertheless, despite our collective efforts, we \\nhave not been able to move forward on new  \\n \\ndisarmament and arms control issues. The multilateral \\nmachinery, and in particular the Conference on \\nDisarmament, remains deadlocked. Unfortunately, the \\nmomentum that we had hoped to generate over the past \\nyear has not materialized. Therefore, in Austria’s view, \\nthe Conference on Disarmament has not only lost its \\ncredibility, it is also risking its legitimacy. Austria will \\ntherefore encourage the adoption of a draft resolution, \\nat the next session of the First Committee, on how to \\nmove multilateral disarmament negotiations forward. \\n Austria remains committed to multilateralism and \\nto the United Nations as the noblest form of \\ninternational cooperation. We will therefore support the \\nefforts of the President and the Secretary-General to \\nfurther strengthen the Organization in order to better \\nenable us to face the challenges of our time.', 'In May I visited \\nTunisia, the cradle of the revolutions that have spread \\nacross the Arab world. I spoke to many people there \\nwho told me about their deep yearning for freedom, \\nabout the decades during which their freedom had been \\nsuppressed and about what the revolution meant for \\ntheir lives. One of them was Essma Ben Hamida, the \\nstrong-willed director of a civil society organization \\nactive in micro-finance. She said literally to me, “If \\n  \\n \\n11-51390 16 \\n \\ndemocracy would mean that I lose my rights as a \\nwoman, I do not want democracy.” In one sentence, \\nMs. Ben Hamida defined one of the key challenges we \\nface. \\n The call from the streets of the Arab world for \\nfreedom and democracy has brought about great \\nchange. It has inspired people around the world to \\nclaim their rights.  \\n But huge challenges remain. And the severe \\nfinancial and economic crisis is threatening growth and \\ntrade around the globe. This crisis is undermining \\npeople’s ability to earn a living and enjoy freedom to \\nthe fullest extent. It is thus crucial that we manage \\nthese developments.  \\n The United Nations and individual Governments \\nmust support people’s calls for freedom. Freedom is a \\nright for everyone, a duty for Governments and the \\nmission of the United Nations. Freedom must be \\nsupported by three key pillars: first, security; second, \\ndemocracy and the rule of law; and third, prosperity. \\n Lack of security is a fundamental threat to \\npeople’s freedom. Providing security is a responsibility \\nof Governments and of the international community as \\na whole. \\n In March this year, we rose to the challenge. \\nSecurity Council resolution 1973 (2011) on Libya was \\ntruly historic. It explicitly referred to the international \\ncommunity’s responsibility to protect. It highlighted \\nthe indispensable role of the United Nations. \\n By contrast, the Council’s failure to reach \\nconsensus on Syria has been at great human cost. \\nEvery day we are shocked by new, horrific stories. This \\nvery weekend peaceful demonstrators were carrying a \\nsign that read: “Help Syria. It is bleeding.” We need to \\nlisten to the people of Syria. We need to stop President \\nAl-Assad’s Government from brutally murdering his \\nown citizens in an attempt to crush their legitimate call \\nfor freedom. I urge all members of the Security \\nCouncil to act decisively and agree on targeted \\nsanctions against the regime. \\n Freedom and security are also key issues in the \\nMiddle East peace process. If we do want peace, we \\nneed direct negotiations now, not new resolutions at the \\nUnited Nations. The Netherlands endorses the time \\nframe outlined by the Quartet and stands ready to assist \\nwherever it can. We are a major donor to the \\nPalestinian Authority. We fully support the ambition of \\nthe Palestinian people to build a viable, democratic and \\npeaceful Palestinian State. However, this cannot be \\nviewed separately from the Israeli people’s desire to \\nlive in a secure, internationally recognized Jewish State \\nin peace with their neighbours.  \\n It is really essential that the two parties invest in \\nmutual confidence, refrain from unilateral steps and \\nfind a solution together. They should be prepared to \\nmake the difficult and painful concessions necessary \\nfor the fulfilment of their peoples’ aspirations. I talked \\nwith President Abbas. I talked with Prime Minister \\nNetanyahu. I listened carefully to what they had to say, \\nand the message is simple and clear: negotiate, \\nnegotiate, negotiate. \\n Democracy and the rule of law are the best \\nguarantees for freedom, but they require hard work. As \\nFrancis Fukuyama put it, democracy is more than the \\nmajority voting in elections. It is a complex set of \\ninstitutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of \\npower through law and a system of checks and \\nbalances. That is what it is about.  \\n I admire the tremendous courage that people, \\nyoung and old, have shown to claim their individual \\nliberty and democratic rights. We must support their \\nefforts to build truly democratic societies governed by \\nthe rule of law. The United Nations should play a \\nleading role by helping with institution-building and \\ndeveloping the rule of law. To that effect, Slovakia and \\nthe Netherlands, for their part, are co-chairing the \\nCommunity of Democracies’ task force that is \\nsupporting Tunisia’s democratic transition. \\n The international community should also support \\ninternet access that is free and uncensored. This is an \\nessential tool for people to exercise their freedom of \\nexpression, and we should take great care to make sure \\nthey can use it. Countries supporting this cause should \\nreally unite around it. \\n As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently said, \\n“Countries do not become fit for democracy; they \\nbecome fit through democracy.”  \\n Democracy means freedom and equal rights for \\neveryone. It provides opportunities to empower \\nwomen. Women represent 50 per cent of the world’s \\nhuman capital. It is in every country’s own interest to \\nensure that women take an active role in society and \\n \\n \\n17 11-51390 \\n \\nthe economy as well as in the political process in the \\npolitical power structures. I am convinced that in free \\nand fair elections, extremists who want to take away \\nwomen’s rights will not succeed.  \\n Real democracy also means that the rights of \\nreligious groups, including Christians, are respected. \\nSociety as a whole should be tolerant towards those \\nwith other religions and beliefs. There should be no \\ndoubt about that. \\n Freedom offers the best route to prosperity. The \\nongoing global economic crisis is affecting prosperity \\neverywhere in our world. \\n Enabling free trade is vital to economic recovery. \\nMarket access is crucial for private sector \\ndevelopment. Breaking down the barriers to trade in \\nagricultural products can galvanize entrepreneurship in \\nthe countries that really need it the most. The Arab \\nregion in particular should benefit from enhanced \\nexport opportunities to the European Union.  \\n The beauty of well-regulated free trade is that it \\nis not a zero-sum game; it benefits everyone and it is \\npart and parcel of freedom. This is why the World \\nTrade Organization (WTO) Doha Round must succeed. \\nThe world should not and cannot revert to \\nprotectionism. The WTO has an important part to play \\nin preventing this. The European Union is also \\nambitiously negotiating free trade agreements with \\nvarious partners. Of course, these agreements should fit \\nwithin the multilateral system. \\n Free trade leads to economic growth, which in \\nturn should also benefit the poorest countries in this \\nworld. To further support their growth, we should \\nenhance their access to education, vocational training \\nand microfinance for women and the poor. \\n Freedom belongs to us all. Those who have \\nfought to gain their freedom will never give it up. \\nFreedom must be supported through security, \\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and prosperity. We can \\nachieve this through the efforts of Member States. \\nSince the United Nations is the international forum \\nwhere global issues and actors come together, it is here \\nat the United Nations that we must join forces. We are \\nwitnessing international developments unfolding more \\nrapidly than ever before. The United Nations needs to \\nadapt to maintain its important role in international \\nrelations. \\n For that matter, the Security Council should \\nbetter reflect changing international relations and \\neconomic realities. The Netherlands supports a modest \\nenlargement of the Security Council, but with a limit \\non the right of veto in order not to undermine the \\neffectiveness of the Council’s decision-making process. \\n The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General’s \\ndrive for budgetary discipline. We have to make careful \\nchoices about what to finance and what not to. I also \\nurge emerging economies to take their share of \\nresponsibility for the sustainability of United Nations \\nfunding. \\n The United Nations has an essential role in \\nfostering the rule of law around the world, as well as in \\npreventative diplomacy and mediation. The Netherlands \\nwill play its part, including through the role of The \\nHague as the international city of peace and justice. \\nThe Peace Palace, the international courts and the legal \\ninstitutions attest to our long tradition of international \\nlaw and active role in its practice. That tradition, may I \\nsay, goes back to Grotius’s early seventeenth-century \\nMare Liberum, which laid the foundation for \\ninternational law. \\n I would like to congratulate Secretary-General \\nBan Ki-moon on his reappointment. I call on him to \\nuse the overwhelming support for his second term as a \\nmandate to reform the United Nations. A strong and \\nactive United Nations is essential in a world in which \\nno country can shape the future single-handedly. To \\nsucceed, public support for the United Nations is \\ncrucial. Clear and tangible results are necessary to \\nsustain the commitment of Governments to the United \\nNations. An effective and efficient United Nations is in \\nthe national interests of all its Member States, and is, \\nindeed, essential for freedom throughout the world. \\n Through our efforts at the United Nations, we can \\nsupport the calls for freedom around the world. Then, \\non my next visit to Tunisia, Essma Ben Hamida, a \\nstrong-willed woman, can hopefully tell me that \\nfreedom has brought her both democracy and her rights \\nand empowerment as a woman.', 'Seldom has \\npeople’s yearning for freedom, dignity and self-\\ndetermination played such a dominant role as it has this \\nyear. Until now, we have experienced globalization \\n \\n \\n49 11-51384 \\n \\nfirst and foremost through the ever-greater integration \\nof the world economy. Today, we see that globalization \\nmeans so much more; that it has also brought about a \\nglobalization of values. Those are the values enshrined \\nin the United Nations Charter, the inalienable rights \\ncontained in the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights. \\n In North Africa and in the Arab world, millions of \\npeople have shaken off the shackles of decades of \\noppression. They want freedom, democracy and human \\nrights, as well as better lives for themselves and their \\nfamilies. That road is anything but easy. A new \\npolitical system must mature in order to become stable. \\nThat takes time and patience. However, even the \\nlongest road begins with the very first step. This is a \\nyear of momentous steps. \\n We have not forgotten the moving images of \\npeople who won dignity and self-respect by their own \\nefforts, the proud faces on Bourguiba Boulevard in \\nTunis and in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Those people want \\nto shape their own future, and their yearning is by no \\nmeans limited to the Arab world. In Belarus, too, \\npeople long for an end to repression and tyranny and \\nfor the opportunity to fully develop their individual \\npersonalities. \\n With the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification \\nmore than 20 years ago, Germany experienced for \\nitself the joy of a peaceful revolution. Today we have a \\nfundamental interest in the success of the political \\nawakening in the southern Mediterranean region. We \\nGermans offer our support for the reforms in Morocco \\nand Jordan, the political awakening in Egypt and \\nTunisia, and the fresh start in Libya following the \\noverthrow of the dictator. \\n Every country and every society will find its own \\nway into the modern world, either through revolution \\nor through reform. We want to provide advice and \\nsupport. We want to help create an independent \\njudiciary, a pluralistic media landscape, and a vibrant \\ncivil society. We want to help people come to terms \\nwith their past and we want to support the \\nconstitutional process. Above all, however, we want to \\nassist in the crucial process of building a new social \\nand economic order, for we all know that the success of \\nsocial change largely hinges on economic success. \\nPeople who take to the streets for freedom and self-\\ndetermination must see first-hand that they, too, can \\nsucceed with the help of their ideas, their creativity and \\ntheir commitment. \\n Germany is therefore working not only for close \\npartnerships but for increased market access. We want \\nto foster change through increased trade. We are \\noffering investments, especially in the small and \\nmedium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of an \\nopen and successful society. Most important of all, \\nhowever, will be to offer young people education and \\ntraining so that they can make the most of their \\nopportunities. That is of key importance to successful \\ntransitions and fresh starts in those countries. \\n The courageous men and women of Syria deserve \\na clear sign of our solidarity. The Syrian Government \\nhas responded to the legitimate demands of the Syrian \\npeople with brutal force. Germany will continue to \\npress for a Security Council resolution. This is not only \\nabout showing solidarity with the Syrian people; it is \\nalso about the credibility of the international \\ncommunity. If the repression continues, we Europeans \\nwill further tighten sanctions against the regime. The \\nSyrian people should be free to shape their own future. \\n This week has been dominated by the unresolved \\nconflict in the Middle East. On Friday here in New \\nYork, President Abbas expressed the Palestinians’ \\nexpectations and understandable frustration with the \\nlack of progress made (see ). On the same \\nday, Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s \\njustified desire to exist in peace within secure borders \\n(see ). Both sides have legitimate interests. \\nHowever, these interests are certainly not \\nirreconcilable. They can be overcome if the parties \\ninvolved are willing to do so. \\n Germany is backing a two-State solution. We \\nsupport a Palestinian State that will allow the \\nPalestinians to live in dignity and self-determination \\nand that is independent, sovereign, contiguous and \\ndemocratic, as well as politically and economically \\nviable. Over the past few years, we have been heavily \\ninvolved in the practical development of this statehood \\nby helping to build an administration, infrastructure \\nand vocational training, as well as politically, in the \\nGerman-Palestinian Steering Committee. And we do \\nnot want that State to be founded sometime in the \\ndistant and indeterminate future. \\n Let there be no doubt, however, that the security \\nof Israel is and will continue to be part of the raison \\nd’être of the Federal Republic of Germany. Peace \\n  \\n \\n11-51384 50 \\n \\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians is possible. A \\nPalestinian State is possible. Two States existing \\npeacefully side by side are possible. However, they can \\nbe achieved only through negotiations. The statement \\nissued by the Middle East Quartet on Friday identified \\nthe milestones along the way. Germany worked hard \\nfor that Quartet statement and staunchly supports it. \\n The confrontation of words here in New York \\nmust not be allowed to lead to an escalation in violence \\nin the Middle East. I therefore call on both sides, \\nPalestinians and Israelis, to enter into direct \\nnegotiations without delay. On Friday, the two sides \\nreaffirmed their desire for a negotiated peace. The task \\nnow is to channel the energy and pressure of recent \\ndays into a constructive process. The two sides have \\nbeen called on to come forward within three months \\nwith comprehensive proposals on territory and security, \\nand to refrain from all provocative actions. The \\ninternational community will continue to support the \\ndifficult road to peace. This includes the Moscow \\nconference as part of the negotiating timetable for the \\ncoming months. \\n I would like to express my appreciation to all \\nwho have worked so hard in the past few days to create \\nthis opportunity for a constructive solution. As a \\nEuropean, I would like to extend my special thanks to \\nthe European Union’s High Representative, Lady \\nAshton. Let us make use of the impetus provided by \\nthe intensive efforts here in New York for the benefit of \\nthe people of Israel and the Palestinian territories. \\n The international community has worked \\ntirelessly for years to ensure that Afghanistan ceases to \\nharbour a threat to international peace and security. \\nMany, indeed too many people have already lost their \\nlives as a result of that threat. On 5 December in Bonn, \\nunder Afghanistan’s chairmanship, we will discuss the \\nway forward. The Conference will focus on three major \\nissues. The first is the complete handover of \\nresponsibility for security. This summer saw the start \\nof a process whereby the Afghans are to gradually \\nassume responsibility for security in their country by \\n2014. This is a responsible handover of responsibility. \\n Secondly, the international community will \\nremain engaged in Afghanistan after 2014. Afghanistan \\nwill continue to need economic initiatives and more \\nregional cooperation to help strengthen its sovereignty. \\nThe New Silk Road initiative, which we launched here \\nin New York last week, is intended to serve this aim.  \\n Thirdly, Afghanistan’s internal reconciliation and \\nsupport from States in the region are critical to lasting \\npeace. The brutal murder of former President Rabbani \\nshows that the reconciliation process will continue to \\nsuffer setbacks. Nevertheless, it must and will go on. \\nGermany will play its part on the road to Bonn. \\n While people are seizing the opportunity to build \\na better future for themselves in freedom and self-\\ndetermination in a growing number of countries around \\nthe world, millions in the Horn of Africa are struggling \\nto survive. The United Nations has played a valuable \\nrole in providing swift humanitarian assistance. \\nGermany is doing everything in its power in this and \\nmany other crises to alleviate the suffering. \\n The collapse of State authority and the impact of \\nclimate change are aggravating the already disastrous \\nsituation. Germany will continue to be in the vanguard \\nof the fight against climate change. As with \\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, as well as \\nthe protection of human rights, the fight against \\nclimate change is an integral element of preventive \\ndiplomacy. It is part of a farsighted peace policy. \\n By the end of this year, our planet will have more \\nthan 7 billion inhabitants. In that world, Germany will \\nplace its hopes in a strong United Nations as a forum \\nfor political consensus-building, a source of rules with \\ninternational legitimacy, and a player in the crisis \\nregions of this world. The United Nations Charter and \\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights offer more \\npeople than ever before the direction and inspiration \\nthey need to strive for a cooperative world order and a \\nfairer global community. \\n However, the United Nations has to adapt to our \\nchanging world. Only then will the decisions made \\nhere gain political force, effectiveness and acceptance. \\nNew centres of power are emerging in global politics. \\nTheir economic dynamism has prompted them to \\ndemand political participation. The sixty-fifth session \\nof the General Assembly considered United Nations \\nreform, but no real progress has been achieved so far. \\nWe welcome the fact that the new President intends to \\nagain personally champion this reform. We will do \\neverything we can to him. \\n In September 38 years ago, two German States \\nwere admitted to the United Nations. At that time, my \\npredecessor in office, Walter Scheel, stated before the \\nAssembly: \\n \\n \\n51 11-51384 \\n \\n “Where there is a question of international \\ncooperation, of preserving peace and of \\nprotecting the rights of man, there the Federal \\nRepublic of Germany will always be found. If \\nthere is anything we have learned from our own \\nbitter experience it is this: man is the measure of \\nall things”. \\n Man is the measure of all things. Germany \\nremains committed to this principle.', 'How \\ncan we shape development policy that is of benefit to \\nall? The per capita gross domestic product of \\nSwitzerland is 130 times higher than that of a country \\nsuch as Mozambique. Why do the poorest countries \\nbenefit so little from globalization, and what can we do \\nto change this? One-quarter of the world’s population \\nconsumes three-quarters of the available raw materials. \\nHow can we ensure that nearly 7 billion individuals \\nhave enough water, food and energy at affordable \\nprices? And what happened to equity and social justice \\nin the twenty-first century? \\n It is up to us together to find the answers to these \\nquestions. That will require us to have a sense of \\nresponsibility and to be ready to reflect together on \\nnorms, values and priorities. \\n More than any other international organization, \\nthe United Nations has the potential and the necessary \\n  \\n \\n11-50692 50 \\n \\nconditions to support States in these efforts. Since its \\nfounding, the United Nations has developed into a \\ndense institutional network. International governance \\nremains fragmented and inefficient. Governance \\nstructures need to be strengthened if the United \\nNations is to succeed as the driving force towards \\nsustainable development. \\n Events in the Arab world have been a reminder \\nthat democracy and sustainable development go hand \\nin hand. Indeed, it was ultimately the lack of political \\nfreedom, combined with injustice and a lack of \\neconomic prospects, that unleashed the fundamental \\nchanges that have so surprised us. Many nations are \\nfacing difficult changes today and the fact that \\nrelations among States and between the region and the \\nrest of the world need to be based on new principles. \\nThis is a challenge to the countries themselves and to \\nthe new social groups driving the change: youth, \\nwomen, the emerging middle classes and civil society \\nas a whole. But it is also a challenge to the countries \\nand Governments of the region, as well as for us all as \\nMembers of the United Nations. \\n We must do our best to ensure that effective aid is \\nprovided quickly to the victims of unrest and violence. \\nWe must ensure that security and the rule of law are \\nstrengthened. We must contribute to inclusive political \\ndialogue, promoting national reconciliation and \\nlegitimate efforts to create new constitutions. We must \\nextend the authority of State institutions and restore \\npublic services. We must help to protect the human \\nrights of all and support transitional justice. We must \\nalso support immediate economic recovery measures. \\nOnly through such a wide-ranging programme, backed \\nby an international community in which each member \\nis ready to make a constructive contribution, will it be \\npossible to create more favourable conditions for \\nsustainable development. \\n I note with regret that the spirit of optimism \\nborne of the Arab Spring has not breathed new life into \\nthe Middle East peace process. We remember the \\nwords of President Obama before the General \\nAssembly a year ago well — words that encouraged us \\nto hope for change. For a few minutes, we dreamed \\ntogether of  \\n “the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no \\nceiling on her dreams or the young boy in Sderot \\nwho wants to sleep without the nightmare of \\nrocket fire” (A/65/PV.11, p. 12).  \\nWe entertained the hope that, together with Palestine \\nand Israel, we could succeed in reaching an agreement \\nthat would allow us to welcome a new Member to the \\nUnited Nations — a sovereign and independent \\nPalestine, living side by side in peace with Israel. \\n Somberly, we note instead that the past year has \\nbeen a year of deadlock with no progress but \\nstagnation, and even a hardening of positions. For \\nmore than 60 years, the international community has \\nfailed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The \\nso-called peace process has replaced peace. In order to \\nreturn peace to the centre of the stage, influential \\npeople on both sides have attempted to implement a \\ntangible and lasting vision. We gave them our support \\nand facilitated a model agreement. The Geneva \\ninitiative is today a consolidated, detailed proposal \\ncompatible with internationally accepted parameters, \\nincluding the Arab Peace Initiative. It remains at the \\ndisposal of the decision-makers, as well as of the \\npopulations whose right it is to demand peace. \\n Preventing future wars was the goal of the \\nfounding of the United Nations. Today, it remains \\namong the noblest objectives of this Organization. The \\npast two decades have shown that the international \\ncommunity has every interest in finding ways to \\nstrengthen its efforts in the area of mediation. Indeed, \\nit is in a negotiated solution rather than military victory \\nthat a lasting solution will be found for the majority of \\nconflicts.  \\n The Security Council plays an important role in \\nthe prevention of conflicts. Switzerland would \\nwelcome a stronger and more lasting commitment to \\npreventive diplomacy on the part of the Security \\nCouncil. If the Security Council is to be able to make a \\nworthwhile contribution to peace and security, it must \\nadapt to new realities and reflect the new political \\nbalance of power of the twenty-first century. I should \\nalso like it to be more transparent and open and to \\nfulfil its duty of remaining accountable to the Member \\nStates.  \\n Ultimately, the decisions of the Security Council \\nhave a direct impact on all States in ways that are \\nlegally binding. That is why Switzerland advocates, \\nalong with its partners in the so-called small five \\ngroup, improvement of the Council’s working methods. \\nThe small five’s proposals are practical and concrete. \\nThey can be implemented immediately without any \\nneed to amend the United Nations Charter.  \\n \\n \\n51 11-50692 \\n \\n However, the United Nations will be truly \\nstrengthened only if those countries that rightly insist \\non having greater participation also show themselves \\nready to accept greater responsibility for the \\nOrganization’s proper functioning and its financial \\nsituation. \\n The United Nations is unique in being the only \\nOrganization that offers all the countries of the world \\nthe opportunity to join together to address the whole \\nrange of international challenges to peace and security, \\nranging from the protection of human rights to \\nsustainable development. Switzerland is ready to \\ncontribute, and we look forward to working together  \\n \\nwith the new President of the General Assembly, \\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, whom I congratulate \\non his election and offer the full support of my country \\nduring this sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.', '\\ufeffOn behalf of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,\\nlet me congratulate President Jeremić on his election\\nas President of the General Assembly. He can count on\\nthe full support of my country as he assumes this major\\nresponsibility.\\nThe General Assembly is the central body of the\\nUnited Nations architecture. Here all Member States\\nare represented, and each has a vote, irrespective\\nof its size, its population or its economic power. The\\nAssembly truly is the concert of nations embodying\\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of all Member\\nStates. To President Jeremić, the conductor of the\\nconcert of States here assembled, we wish inspiration,\\npassion and wisdom.\\nLuxembourg is proud to have been part, since the\\nvery beginning, of the peace project that is the United\\nNations.\\nOur then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Joseph\\nBeck, in presenting the Charter of the United Nations\\nCharter — signed a few weeks earlier in San Francisco —\\nto the Luxembourg Parliament on 9 August 1945, spoke\\nthe following visionary words:\\n“It is in the work of the United Nations that our\\ncountry found the hope of rebirth in its darkest\\nhour; it is within the United Nations that it has\\ntaken up its place as an independent State, as a free\\ncountry; it is among these peaceful countries, just\\nunited by the Organization of San Francisco in the\\nwonderful hope of a lasting peace, that it will find\\nthe guarantees of a future which are necessary for\\nits renewal”.\\nHistory has vindicated him. Determined, with the\\nother peoples of the United Nations, to save succeeding\\ngenerations from the scourge of war, Luxembourg\\nfound in the United Nations and in multilateralism\\nin general the ideal framework to flourish as an\\nindependent, sovereign State, free to choose for\\nitself. Luxembourg has been able to prosper thanks\\nto the peace it has enjoyed since 1945. In return, we\\nhave resolutely committed ourselves, within the\\nUnited Nations, to contribute to building peace and\\nto promoting sustainable development for the greatest\\nnumber possible.\\nPresident Jeremić has rightly chosen the peaceful\\nsettlement of disputes as the theme of the general\\ndebate at the current session. It is one of the overarching\\nobjectives of our Organization, aimed at enabling it to\\nmaintain international peace and security. To settle\\ndisputes peacefully, the Charter has attributed a major\\nrole not only to the Security Council, but also to the\\nGeneral Assembly and to the International Court of\\nJustice.\\nThe Syrian crisis, which has lasted already 18\\nmonths, continues to get worse. It has now claimed more\\nthan 20,000 victims. Repercussions on neighbouring\\ncountries continue to intensify. The crisis is a call on\\nour collective conscience and puts our commitment to\\nthe test. Some are tempted to accuse the United Nations\\nof inaction. However, the fault lies elsewhere. Those\\nresponsible for the terrifying violence, the war crimes,\\nthe egregious human rights violations and crimes\\nagainst humanity committed in Syria will one day\\nhave to answer for them. Such is Luxembourg’s firm\\nconviction.\\nThe failure to this day of attempts to resolve the\\nSyrian crisis through peaceful means must not lead\\nus to neglect the quest for political solutions to other\\ncrises.\\nLuxembourg has consistently advocated a peaceful\\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That\\nconflict has been going on for far too long. It is\\nessential that the parties resume direct negotiations and\\nnegotiate a sustainable peace among themselves, with\\nthe support of the Quartet. The path will no doubt be\\narduous, but the objective is worth it for the Israelis, the\\nPalestinians and the region as a whole. We would like to\\nsee an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable\\nState of Palestine, living side by side with the State of\\nIsrael in peace and security.\\nLuxembourg has for many years now supported the\\nbuilding of the Palestinian State at both the political\\nand the economic levels. We also support Palestine’s\\naspirations to assume its place among the nations of the\\nworld. We provide financial support to the Palestinian\\nAuthority in order to assist it in making its public\\nadministration and basic social services work, and we\\nare also a reliable partner of the United Nations Relief\\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near\\nEast. Under an agreement signed in February 2012, Luxembourg will provide assistance in the amount of\\n€15 million to Palestine refugees throughout the period\\n2012-2015.\\nAllow me to give a few other examples to illustrate\\nhow Luxembourg is contributing to the peaceful\\nsettlement of international disputes. First, as was\\nrecalled during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of\\nLaw, Luxembourg was one of the very first States to\\nrecognize the jurisdiction of the International Court\\nof Justice as compulsory. The Court elucidates and\\ndevelops international law and thereby strengthens\\npeaceful relations between States. Next, Luxembourg\\nsupports preventive diplomacy and mediation activities\\nas well as the good offices undertaken by the United\\nNations. Our support in that area also benefits regional\\norganizations, such as the African Union. Finally,\\nLuxembourg also supports civil society, as it did\\nin 2010, when it backed the mediation efforts by the\\nCommunity of Sant’Egidio between political and civil\\nsociety actors in Guinea and the Niger.\\nLuxembourg, a multicultural and multilingual State\\nby virtue of its history, its geographical location and the\\ncomposition of its population, has often played the role\\nof mediator between its large European neighbours and\\nwithin the European Union.\\nBuilding on a balanced foreign policy, free\\nfrom the legacy of a colonial past and defined by\\nan unwavering commitment to multilateralism,\\nLuxembourg is at the service of the United Nations\\nwhen it comes to playing the role of honest broker and\\nassuming the responsibilities that come with that role.\\nIn 2009, moreover, Luxembourg had the honour of\\nchairing the Economic and Social Council at a crucial\\njuncture marked by the devastating effects of the global\\neconomic and financial crisis of 2008.\\nMy country has also been a linchpin of the\\nPeacebuilding Commission since its inception in 2005.\\nSince February 2011, the Permanent Representative of\\nLuxembourg to the United Nations, Ambassador Sylvie\\nLucas, has chaired the Guinea configuration of the\\nPeacebuilding Commission. Luxembourg is honoured\\nto be able to marshal the efforts of the international\\ncommunity in support of the authorities in Conakry,\\nwho have asked to be assisted in three priority areas:\\nnational reconciliation, security sector reform, and\\nyouth and women’s employment. Our commitment\\nstems from our conviction that we need to adopt a\\nglobal approach towards peacebuilding and towards the maintenance of international peace and security — an\\napproach that recognizes the intrinsic link between\\nsecurity and development.\\nIndeed, to ensure lasting peace, one must tackle the\\nroot causes of conflicts. Luxembourg is concentrating\\non two of these: social inequalities resulting from\\npersistent poverty, and the increasing scarcity of natural\\nresources as a result of climate change.\\nThe fight against poverty is one of our stated\\npriorities. Since 2000, Luxembourg has reached the goal\\nset by the United Nations of dedicating at least 0.7 per\\ncent of its gross national income to official development\\nassistance. In 2009 and 2010, that assistance exceeded\\nthe threshold of 1 per cent of our gross national income.\\nThe Government of Luxembourg is determined to\\nmaintain that effort despite budgetary constraints. Our\\nassistance is benefiting the least developed countries\\nin particular. Here again, we exceed the goal set by the\\nUnited Nations by dedicating more than 0.2 per cent\\nof our gross national income to those countries, the\\nmajority of which are in Africa.\\nBeyond simple statistics, those figures reflect our\\nspirit of solidarity towards developing countries. That\\nspirit drives not only our political decision-makers\\nand our development cooperation experts but also the\\nnumerous citizens who are acting through civil society\\norganizations. My family is proud to participate in that\\nmovement of solidarity. My wife, the Grand Duchess,\\ninvests herself fully in the social sector as a UNICEF\\nEminent Advocate for Children, notably in Burundi.\\nShe has been passionate about microfinance for many\\nyears and has completed numerous projects in that area.\\nAs the report of the Secretary-General (A/67/1)\\nhighlights, we have achieved, worldwide, some essential\\ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals ahead\\nof time. However, the effects of global warming are\\ncatastrophic and are threatening to undo the progress\\nthat has been accomplished. In the least developed\\ncountries, the situation is particularly worrisome. It is\\ntherefore essential that we act resolutely in that area.\\nProgress has been made at the Conferences of the\\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention\\non Climate Change in Cancún and then in Durban. We\\nnow need further commitments to be made in terms of\\nreducing carbon emissions. Another major challenge\\nlies in the mobilization of adequate financial and\\ntechnological resources to enable the most vulnerable\\ncountries, in particular, the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island\\ndeveloping States, to adapt to the effects of climate\\nchange. Luxembourg is acting to meet that challenge.\\nWe have thus decided to join an important programme\\nof support for renewable energy that would meet the\\nspecific needs of Pacific small island developing States.\\nI personally attended the United Nations Conference\\non Sustainable Development in Brazil in June in order\\nto show how high a priority the sustainable development\\nof our planet is for my country. None of us has the\\nmeans to make it on our own. Our interdependence\\npushes us to act together. It is a matter of survival. And\\nit is within the United Nations that we must organize\\nour collective survival.\\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention another\\npriority for Luxembourg in terms of conflict\\nprevention, namely, disarmament and non-proliferation.\\nLuxembourg promotes the constant search for security\\nat the lowest level of armaments. It is a party to all\\nrelevant global and regional treaties and conventions\\nand, despite the setback that the international\\ncommunity suffered this year, we remain committed\\nto working towards an arms trade treaty, which would\\nhelp Member States to effectively combat the scourge\\nof uncontrolled arms circulation.\\nWhen conflicts break out despite attempts to\\nprevent them, Luxembourg does not shy away from\\ncommitting itself. My country participates quite\\nregularly and actively in peacekeeping operations. At\\nthe present time, Luxembourg troops are contributing\\nto efforts under the United Nations mandate in Kosovo,\\nLebanon and Afghanistan. Through its contributions\\nto European Union missions, Luxembourg has also\\nassumed responsibilities in the Democratic Republic of\\nthe Congo, in the fight against piracy off the coast of\\nSomalia and in the Sahel region, where the international\\ncommunity must redouble its efforts to prevent terrorist\\ngroups linked to transnational organized crime from\\ntaking root.\\nAll the areas of action I have touched upon here\\nshow how indispensable the United Nations is. If\\nwe are convinced of the relevance of a multilateral\\napproach founded on the United Nations, we must\\ngive the Organization the means to be a true centre\\nof multilateral action. For that, we need to continue\\nto press ahead with United Nations reform, including\\nSecurity Council reform. We are all aware of the need\\nto make the Security Council more inclusive and more representative of today’s realities and to make it more\\neffective and transparent by continuing to improve its\\nworking methods.\\nAfrica should finally take its rightful place on the\\nCouncil, in particular among the permanent members.\\nIt is also important to ensure adequate representation\\nfor small States, which represent the vast majority of\\nthe Member States of the Organization.\\nLuxembourg’s action in the United Nations\\nsince 1945 can be summarized by three key words:\\ncommitment, solidarity, responsibility. Yet, although\\nLuxembourg has consistently proved its solidarity and\\ncommitment and has taken on responsibilities at the\\nUnited Nations, it has not ever had the honour of serving\\non the Security Council. Building on its commitment to\\npeacekeeping operations and peacebuilding activities,\\nLuxembourg declared its candidature 11 years ago\\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for\\nthe period 2013-2014. Luxembourg stands ready to\\nshare primary responsibility for the maintenance of\\ninternational peace and security, which the States\\nMembers of the United Nations have conferred on the\\nSecurity Council under the Charter.\\nCommitment to effective multilateralism does not\\ndepend on size. During his official visit to Luxembourg\\non 17 April 2012, when he addressed our Parliament\\nand thus our country, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\\nmade the following eloquent pronouncement:\\n“You have shown that it is not the size of a nation’s\\nterritory that makes the difference. It is the size of a\\nnation’s heart. It is the breadth of a nation’s vision.\\nIt is the depth of a nation’s promise to the wider\\nworld.”\\nThat recognition honours us. It has further strengthened\\nLuxembourg’s resolve to prove itself up to the task and\\nto serve the United Nations.\\n', '\\ufeffFirst of\\nall, on behalf of my country, I would like to welcome\\nthe broad vision and the pertinence of the ideas put\\nforward by the Secretary-General.\\nI come from Belgium, one of the six founding\\ncountries of the European Union (EU), a multicultural\\nunion of 500 million people who, as President Obama\\nhas reminded us, live in peace — something that I wish\\nfor the entire world — after experiencing horrifying\\nwars.\\nBelgium provides a unique setting for political\\ndecisions and international meetings. Brussels is\\nthe capital of Europe and also the seat of NATO\\nheadquarters. We are naturally open to the world. I\\nmyself come from the city of Mons, which will be the\\nEuropean cultural capital in 2015. In 2014, Belgium\\nwill solemnly commemorate the centennial of the\\nstart of the sad and painful First World War. We will\\ndo so in memory of the young people from more than\\n50 countries who, on our territory, defended the ideals\\nof peace and freedom. In 2013, Antwerp will host the\\nWorld Outgames, a gathering of tolerance and diversity, while the city of Liège is a candidate to host the World’s\\nFair in 2017. All those international events have a single\\ngoal: to bring us closer together and to mobilize around\\nuniversal values.\\nFor my country, respect for life and human rights\\nis fundamental. Whether we speak of the rights of the\\nchild, of women or of refugees, or of the struggle against\\nall forms of discrimination, a single principle guides\\nmy country: the effective equality of all human beings,\\nregardless of status or beliefs. In that light, Belgium will\\njoin Slovenia in sponsoring a draft resolution against\\nracial discrimination. I hope members will support it.\\nAll heads of State and ministers share an immense\\ncollective responsibility to ensure that women become\\nequal to men worldwide at the political, social and\\neconomic levels; to ensure that little girls are no\\nlonger subjected to circumcision; and that acts of\\nviolence against women are systematically fought and\\neliminated.\\nIn my country, women head three ministries: the\\nMinistry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and\\nthe Ministry of the Police. Significant efforts have\\nalso been made to more effectively combat domestic\\nviolence. Our national laws prohibit and punish all\\nforms of discrimination, whether on the basis of gender\\nor that of claimed race, disability or sexual orientation.\\nIn my country, both marriage and adoption are open\\nto same-sex couples. Those are grounds for pride in\\nBelgium.\\nWith the support of several countries of the European\\nUnion, Belgium invites members to take vigorous,\\nconcerted action in various realms of social life. I am\\nthinking first and foremost of the decriminalization of\\nsexual orientation and the promotion of the rights of\\nlesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. In that\\nregard, I welcome the initiative of UNESCO to counter\\nhomophobia in schools.\\nFor my country, freedom of religion, which is to\\nsay the freedom to practise or not practise a religion,\\nis fundamental. Belgium unequivocally condemns\\nIslamophobia. We just as firmly condemn violence,\\nwhich is unacceptable in all cases. We believe that\\nhuman beings should be free to think what they wish\\nand be able to express their indignation without ever\\nresorting to violence. Diplomatic missions should be\\ninviolable throughout the world. It is not by oppressing\\nhuman beings or promoting violence that the fundamental challenges of prosperity, the well-being of\\ncitizens and peace will be resolved.\\nBelgium attaches particular importance to\\nstrengthening the rule of law throughout the world. The\\nreason for that is simple: in my country we are convinced\\nthat the rule of law is necessary for development and\\nprosperity. It contributes to a better world, because the\\npurpose of the rule of law is to enable every human\\nbeing to live, flourish and love in complete freedom.\\nFor that reason, and in the spirit of mutual human\\nrespect, we support the principle of the responsibility\\nto protect victims of violence wherever they are. In\\nthe same spirit, Belgium responded to the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s call by instituting 17 specific projects.\\nThe rule of law and the enforcement of respect for\\nhuman rights require us to step up the fight against\\nimpunity. Belgium will continue its policy of active\\ncooperation with international criminal tribunals. The\\naction of the International Criminal Court will help to\\nusher in an era of responsibility. It is incumbent upon all\\nStates to cooperate with the Court. Belgium, together\\nwith Slovenia and the Netherlands, calls on all States\\nrepresented here to improve international cooperation\\nin mutual legal assistance and extradition.\\nAs the President of Brazil pointed out\\n(see A/67/PV.6), the effects of the economic crisis\\nand financial speculation are felt by every household.\\nWhen the balance sheets of banks represent 300 per\\ncent, 400 per cent or 600 per cent of gross domestic\\nproduct — indeed, even more in some countries — we\\nshould not be surprised that there is a direct link between\\nbank management and the economic and budgetary\\nhealth of sovereign States. In many countries in-depth\\nstudies have been carried out and decisions taken, but\\nclearly that is not enough. That is because the financial\\nworld operates in line with the rhythm of its own peculiar\\nlogic. Here at the United States the phenomenon is\\nbetter understood than elsewhere. Programme trading\\ndominates financial exchanges. The software reacts a\\nmillion times faster than human traders, buying and\\nselling thousands of shares every millionth of a second.\\nWe must work together here at the international level to\\nestablish oversight mechanisms for the financial world,\\nwith a view to ensuring that it again assists more in job\\ncreation and that it steers clear of risky management\\npractices that compromise the economic and budgetary\\nhealth of nations.\\nIn Belgium we are working on the issue nationally\\nand within the eurozone. But an agreed international approach is becoming indispensable. Beyond such\\nin-depth reforms in the banking and financial sectors,\\nlet us also dare to tax financial transactions. It is high\\ntime that income derived from that source be used to\\npromote prosperity for our people.\\nThe Assembly is committed to the follow-up\\nto the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\\nDevelopment. We can never underline enough that we\\nmust break with an economic development model that\\ndevours natural resources and energy. Belgium supports\\nthe Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for All\\ninitiative. It also stresses the importance of merging\\nwithin one process the Millennium Development Goals\\nand the sustainable development goals.\\nI would like to turn to some regional issues that my\\ncountry finds especially disturbing and tragic. In the\\nGreat Lakes region, the situation in the eastern part of\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the resurgent\\nviolence and the Mouvement du 23 Mars rebellion\\ngreatly concern the Belgian Government, especially\\nbecause of their serious impact on local populations.\\nWe see images of massacres, rape, forced recruitment,\\nincluding of children, pillaging, 400,000 internally\\ndisplaced persons — all of it completely unacceptable.\\nBelgium calls upon the countries of the region to\\nredouble their efforts to put an end to the current\\nrebellion. We also call for a response to the root causes\\nof instability in the Great Lakes region. We commend\\nthe Secretary-General’s attention to the region and his\\ninitiative in calling a high-level meeting tomorrow\\non the crisis. Our Foreign Minister will attend, and\\nBelgium stands ready to do what it can to help.\\nThe territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic\\nof the Congo must categorically be respected. All\\nexternal support for the rebels must stop. Let us not\\ndelude ourselves. Denying the facts does not make\\nthem disappear. The facts on the ground give the lie to\\nall denials. Belgium calls on all countries in the Great\\nLakes region to pledge to respect the sovereignty of the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Belgium also urges\\nthe Congolese authorities to institute the necessary\\nreforms in the army and the police to re-establish the\\nrule of law in the whole of its territory, including,\\nobviously, the eastern part.\\nI dearly hope that reason will prevail. Belgium is\\nready to work to help restore trust among the countries\\nof the region. We furthermore hope that direct relations\\nbetween the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the President of Rwanda can be established\\nand that it will speed progress towards a solution.\\nAs to Syria, we are all deeply concerned by the\\ndeteriorating situation of an impasse on the ground,\\nand a political impasse as well. We are appalled by\\nthe posture of a regime that kills its own citizens.\\nBeyond the 30,000 dead there are at least 250,000\\nrefugees in neighbouring countries, and even more\\ninternally displaced. How is it that the collective human\\nconscience is not in agreement to stop the massacre? I\\nsay respectfully to the members of the Security Council\\nthat we cannot knowingly allow such human suffering\\nto go on. Unless we take action we are complicit in\\ncrimes against humanity.\\nBelgium has faith in and supports Joint Special\\nRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi. Belgium also supports\\nthe efforts by Arab countries and hopes that they will\\nbe successful. We must all hope for a political solution.\\nOne thing is certain. Bashar Al-Assad must leave. The\\nregime has lost all legitimacy. Given the urgency of the\\nsituation and the approaching winter, Belgium urges\\nthe international community to take concrete steps on\\nthe humanitarian front and to come to the aid of the\\nmillions of people affected. Humanitarian concerns are\\nour highest priority. The Belgian Government provides\\nfinancial support for humanitarian aid to the refugees.\\nIn that connection, I will allow myself to insist\\nthat my country demands earnestly that a solution be\\nfound to enable humanitarian organizations to carry\\nout their work, particularly in hospitals, in line with\\ninternational humanitarian law. I believe that both the\\nChinese and Russian authorities will be able to join us\\nin those objectives.\\nI have another comment concerning the region; I\\nwish to mention the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Belgium\\nfavours the rapid resumption of negotiations aimed\\nat finding a solution based on the coexistence of two\\nStates — the State of Israel and a State of Palestine that\\nis independent, democratic, united and viable — living\\ntogether in peace, security and prosperity. We also wish\\nto state very clearly our opposition to the continuation\\nof colonization.\\nMy country believes that multilateralism is the only\\nway to improve conditions of our planet. Belgium is the\\nfifteenth largest contributor to the United Nations.\\nLet us have the courage and strength to agree to\\nfree humankind from wars and social injustices, and support its development. I invite all of us to spur our\\nawareness. Let us demonstrate together our capacity to\\nact.', '\\ufeffThis is the\\nfirst time that I speak from this rostrum at the United Nations. It is a very moving moment for me because\\nI understand what the United Nations represents, for\\nour world, and what it has represented historically. I am\\nalso aware of a sense of responsibility, because France\\nis a permanent member of the Security Council and\\ntherefore has duties. I am also here at this rostrum to\\ntalk about values that do not belong to any particular\\npeople, are not owned by any particular continent\\nand are not the privilege of any particular part of the\\npopulation.\\nI am here to talk about universal values, which\\nFrance has always proclaimed, and about the rights\\nof every human being, wherever they live: liberty,\\nsecurity and resistance to oppression. Those values\\nand those rights are all too frequently held in contempt\\nin our world, especially as we face three main threats,\\nwhich we must tackle head-on. The first is the threat\\nof fanaticism, which fuels violence. We have seen\\nthat yet again in recent days. The second is the global\\neconomy, which has been affected by a crisis and which\\nperpetuates intolerable inequalities. The third threat is\\nthe disturbance in the climate system, which threatens\\nthe very survival of our planet.\\nThe mission of the United Nations is to tackle these\\nchallenges and to find strong and just responses to them\\ntogether. These responses must be just because without\\njustice, force is blind, and they must be strong because\\nwithout strength, justice is powerless.\\nI am also here to express France’s confidence in\\nthe United Nations. In recent years, we have been able\\ntogether, to finally put an end to deadly conflicts, and\\nwe have been able to prevent confrontations. However,\\njust as we are sending out 100,000 Blue Helmets who\\nact on our behalf — and I would like to pay tribute to\\nthem — because of divisions, the blocking of our own\\ninstitutions and inertia, the United Nations has not been\\nable to put an end to war, atrocities and attacks on the\\nrights of peoples.\\nI would therefore, on behalf of France, draw one\\nconclusion that I would like to share with the Assembly.\\nIf we want to make our world safer, it is up to us to fully\\nshoulder our responsibilities. How can we do so?\\nFirst of all, we can do so by reforming our own\\nOrganization, the United Nations. The Security Council\\nmust better reflect the realities of the world today. This\\nis why I would once again recall that France supports\\nthe request for an enlargement of the Council made\\nby Germany, Japan, India and Brazil. But we are also in favour of an increased African presence, including\\namong the permanent members. Having a seat on the\\nSecurity Council is not a privilege justified by history,\\nand it is not a matter of satisfying some ambition related\\nto economic power. No, having a seat on the Security\\nCouncil means making the commitment to take action\\nto promote peace in the world. Indeed, we must act and\\nact together, but act quickly, because it is urgent.\\nThe most urgent situation is in Syria. The Assembly\\nhas several times denounced the massacres carried out\\nby the Syrian regime, called for those responsible to be\\nprosecuted and expressed the desire for a democratic\\ntransition. But the ordeal of the population continues to\\nthis day. There have been almost 30,000 deaths in the\\nlast 18 months. How many more deaths will we wait for\\nbefore we take action? How can we allow the paralysis\\nof the United Nations to continue?\\nI know one thing for certain: the Syrian regime\\nwill never again take its place among the alliance of\\nnations. It has no future among us. This is why I have\\ntaken the decision, on behalf of France, to recognize the\\nprovisional Government representing the new Syria as\\nsoon as it is formed. That Government will itself have\\nto give guarantees that every community in Syria will\\nbe respected and will be able to live in security in their\\nown country. Without further delay, I would ask that\\nthe United Nations immediately give the Syrian people\\nall of the assistance and support they are requesting\\nand, in particular, that the liberated areas be protected\\nand humanitarian aid be assured for refugees. As for\\nthe leaders in Damascus, they must know that the\\ninternational community will not stand by if they take\\nthe unhappy decision to use chemical weapons.\\nAnother situation that is urgent is the fight against\\nthe most serious of threats to stability in the world,\\nnamely, the proliferation of nuclear weapons. For several\\nyears now, Iran has been ignoring the demands of the\\ninternational community. It shuns monitoring by the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. It does not keep\\nits word or uphold Security Council resolutions. I had\\nhoped that negotiations could take place in earnest and\\nthat steps could be outlined, but, again, no negotiations\\nhave taken place. France will not accept such actions,\\nwhich threaten not only security in the region but peace\\nthroughout the world.\\nI therefore state once again that we are prepared to\\nadopt new sanctions, not to punish the great people of Iran, but to tell their leaders that enough is enough and\\nthat negotiations must be resumed before it is too late.\\nThe third urgent issue is at last to find a solution to\\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The status quo is not a\\nresponse; it is an impasse. France will make every effort\\nto re-establish the basis for negotiations leading to the\\ncoexistence of the two States in question; everyone\\nknows that this is the only solution that could lead to a\\njust and lasting peace in the region.\\nThe last of the urgent issues that I will mention,\\nalthough there are many others, might be the most\\nimportant one for us to focus on this week: the Sahel.\\nThe situation created by the occupation of territory\\nin northern Mali by terrorist groups is intolerable,\\ninadmissible and unacceptable. It is unacceptable not\\nonly for Mali, which is affected by that terrorist threat,\\nbut also for all countries of the region and beyond the\\nregion — all of those that one day might be affected by\\nterrorism.\\nThe African Union, which I commend, and the\\nEconomic Community of West African States have said\\nthat they are prepared to take courageous decisions.\\nThe authorities of Mali have spoken; there is no time to\\nlose. France will support any initiative that will enable\\nthe Africans themselves to resolve that issue within the\\nframework of international law, with a clear mandate\\nfrom the Security Council. Mali must recover its\\nterritorial integrity, and terrorism must be eliminated\\nfrom that area of the Sahel.\\nThe role of the United Nations is to respond to\\nurgent situations. But there is another objective that\\nshould unite us here, and that is development. The\\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\\nDevelopment, held in Rio, in which I participated, was\\na disappointing stage for some and an encouraging one\\nfor others. I believe that today we have an agenda that\\nshould encompass economic growth, poverty reduction,\\nsocial progress and environmental protection. That is\\nwhat we need to do over the long term.\\nThe 2015 deadline for a climate agreement is fast\\napproaching. I wish to state here that France is ready to\\nhost the United Nations conference on climate change\\nto be held at that time, because I want us to succeed\\ntogether in meeting that challenge.\\nIn parallel, I would recall that one of the\\ndisappointments of Rio was our failure to agree on\\nthe creation of a major United Nations organization for the environment. That remains France’s objective.\\nSuch an agency would be based in Africa, because\\nthat continent, which has been neglected for too long,\\nis facing climate-related challenges. It would also be\\nhighly symbolic to entrust Africa with such a global\\nagency for the environment.\\nWith respect to development, I believe that we\\nshould face reality. We will not achieve the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals without new resources. Everyone\\nknows the budgetary limitations of our respective\\nStates. That is why today, from this rostrum here at the\\nUnited Nations, I am making an appeal for innovative\\nfinancing, which would give us the means to enable our\\norganizations to fight effectively against diseases such\\nas HIV/AIDS and malaria.\\nI would like to commend the success of the\\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility, which was\\nfinanced by a tax on airline tickets. That path\\nhas been opened, and today we must take another\\nstep in that direction. I propose a tax on financial\\ntransactions — which several European Union countries\\nhave already agreed to — aimed at slowing down the\\nmovement of capital or at least financing development\\nand helping to fight health-related scourges. France\\nhas adopted such a tax. We have also made another\\ncommitment: to dedicate at least 10 per cent of the\\nbenefits of that tax to development and to fight health-\\nrelated threats and pandemics.\\nThat is the message that I wanted to send to the\\nAssembly today: let us ensure that a global tax on\\nfinancial transactions can be levied and that the benefits\\nit yields can be spent on development and fighting\\npandemics. That would be an excellent example of what\\nI call the globalization of solidarity, and one of the best\\nideas that today’s world could implement.\\nBut the mission of the United Nations is not only\\nto fight financial instability or ensure that development\\nremains at the centre of our concerns: it is to work to\\ncounter all forms of instability. I am thinking here about\\ndrug trafficking, a scourge that affects producing, transit\\nand consuming countries. To combat drug traffickers,\\nwho are frequently allied with terrorist networks, the\\nUnited Nations must elaborate and implement a global\\nstrategy to fight against drugs.\\nArms trafficking also poses a major threat. France\\nis firmly committed to the conclusion of a universal\\narms trade treaty. What the United Nations must defend\\nand promote is a worldview that is based on respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. The Arab Spring\\nshowed that those values are universal and apply to all\\ncontinents and countries.\\nI want to welcome the events that took place in\\nTunisia, in Libya, in Egypt. It is true that transitions\\nare not always easy. There are risks, and setbacks can\\noccur. Some may attempt, through violence, to reverse\\nthe progress made and the achievements gained. France\\nwill call on the new political authorities emanating\\nfrom democratic elections in those countries to wage an\\nunrelenting combat against complacency, extremism,\\nfanaticism, hatred, intolerance and violence, whatever\\nthe provocation may be, because there can never be any\\njustification for violence.\\nFrance wants to set an example. It is not telling\\nanyone what to do; that is simply its history and its\\nmessage. We want to be an example in the promotion of\\nfundamental freedoms. That is our combat, and we are\\nhonoured to wage it. That is why France will continue\\nto fight to abolish the death penalty, to ensure women’s\\nright to equality and dignity, and to work towards the\\nuniversal decriminalization of homosexuality, which\\ncannot be viewed as a crime but must be recognized as\\nan orientation.\\nWe will continue to fight for the protection of\\ncivilians. Moreover, I recall that the Assembly affirmed\\nthe principle that all States have the responsibility to\\nensure the security of their civilians. If a State fails\\nin that obligation, it is up to us, the United Nations,\\nto use the means at its disposal to meet it in its place.\\nLet us not neglect that promise, as it can serve us. I\\nam thinking, in particular, of what is happening in the\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, where civilians are the\\nmain victims of clashes and where foreign interference\\nmust cease as soon as possible.\\n\\nThose are the goals that France will support and\\ndefend at the United Nations. France has confidence in\\nthe United Nations. We know that no State, however\\npowerful, can deal with emergencies, undertake the\\nfight for development or overcome all crises. No State\\ncan do that, but, on the contrary, if we act together, we\\nwill live up to our responsibilities. France wants the\\nUnited Nations to be the centre and the framework for\\nglobal governance, but do the States that make up the\\nOrganization want that to be our purpose and goal?\\n\\nI say in all seriousness that when there is paralysis,\\ninertia and inaction, injustice and intolerance find their\\nplace. What I would like members to understand is that\\nwe must act in order to shoulder our responsibilities\\nand to deal with urgent situations, such as Syria,\\nnuclear proliferation and the Sahel. We must also work\\nfor another world that is based on development and\\ninnovative financing and for the fight against health\\ncrises. We must act, always and together. Let us live up\\nto the mission entrusted to us and to the expectations of\\npeoples. That is France’s message.', 'The events of recent\\nmonths have illustrated once again the importanceof the United Nations as a multilateral forum for\\naddressing today’s crises and challenges. The conflicts\\nin Syria and Mali and the ongoing reform processes in\\nmany parts of the Arab world demonstrate that we can\\nface such challenges only through concerted action.\\nIn Syria, thousands have lost their lives in their\\nstruggle for freedom and reform owing to crimes\\ncommitted by a regime that denies them every basic\\nhuman right in order to stay in power. Austria condemns\\nthe systematic human rights violations and bloodshed\\nin Syria in the strongest possible terms. The more than\\n27,000 victims and some 2.5 million people in dire\\nneed of humanitarian assistance are a stark reminder\\nfor each and every one of us that it is high time for the\\nUnited Nations to finally act. The Security Council, in\\nparticular, must assume its responsibilities in relation\\nto the ever-worsening situation in the country. Violence\\nhas to stop immediately, and both sides have to engage\\nin a meaningful dialogue facilitated by Joint Special\\nRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi. There will be no\\nsolution unless President Al-Assad steps aside and\\ngives way to the forces of reason and reconciliation.\\nAustria continues to fully support the ongoing\\ntransition processes in the Arab world. We welcome\\nthe efforts undertaken so far to lay the foundations\\nfor more open, inclusive and prosperous societies. We\\nencourage the newly empowered authorities to fulfil\\ntheir mandate for democratic change responsibly. The\\naspirations of the people for dignity and freedom must\\nbe satisfied, thereby contributing to peace and stability\\nin the region.\\nIn that context, let me reiterate my strongest\\ncondemnation of the recent attacks on diplomatic\\nmissions and personnel, especially the murder of\\nAmbassador Chris Stevens and three of his colleagues\\nin Benghazi. Violence is never an acceptable response\\nto the exercise of the fundamental right of freedom of\\nspeech. To attack an Embassy and its personnel is not\\nonly contrary to international law but an attack on the\\nvery ideals that the United Nations stands for, namely,\\nthe peaceful cooperation of Member States to build a\\nbetter future together.\\nThe still unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\ncontinues to gravely destabilize the Middle\\nEast. The terms of a negotiated and sustainable\\nsolution — two States with secure and mutually\\nrecognized borders — have been discussed over and\\nover again and are broadly supported by the people and the international community, and yet we experienced a\\ncomplete lack of progress in the last year. We therefore\\ncall on the leadership on both sides to finally assume\\ntheir responsibilities and enable a lasting peace and\\nsecurity to be established for their children and future\\ngenerations.\\nThe situation in Mali also continues to be a\\nmatter of grave concern. Austria has been dismayed\\nby the political turmoil, with its disastrous effects on\\nthe Malian population. Growing insecurity and the\\ncontinued deterioration of the humanitarian and human\\nrights situation call for concerted action. The high-level\\nmeeting held on Wednesday was an important signal\\nthat we are moving in that direction. We fully support\\nthe efforts by the Economic Community of West\\nAfrican States and the African Union to try to find,\\ntogether with the United Nations, a lasting political\\nsolution to the crisis in Mali and the Sahel region as\\na whole. Austria will advocate for increased support\\nfrom the European Union to contribute to that end.\\nIn the light of the crises and challenges the\\ninternational community is facing, Austria welcomes\\nPresident Jeremić’s timely choice of theme to highlight\\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes in this year’s\\ngeneral debate. Prevention is always better — and\\ncheaper — than a cure. The progress made in Sierra\\nLeone, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and Myanmar testifies how\\nsuccessful sustainable mediation efforts can be.\\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes can be achieved\\nonly through open dialogue, based on mutual respect.\\nAustria has a long-standing tradition of promoting\\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. We are proud\\nto host the fifth Global Forum of the United Nations\\nAlliance of Civilizations in Vienna. It will take place on\\n27 and 28 February 2013, under the title “Responsible\\nLeadership in Diversity and Dialogue”. Austria highly\\nvalues the contribution of youth as a transformative\\nforce. Therefore, the day before the Global Forum will\\nbe dedicated to the Alliance of Civilizations youth\\nevent in order to benefit from their views.\\nIn that context, I am also pleased to inform that\\nthe King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre\\nfor lnterreligious and Intercultural Dialogue will be\\ninaugurated on 26 November in Vienna. The Centre,\\na joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\\nthe Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Austria,\\nwill certainly offer a significant contribution to the\\npromotion of dialogue.\\nWe need to be clear that sustainable peace and\\ndevelopment go hand in hand with respect for human\\nrights, democracy and the rule of law. These are universal\\nvalues that no human being should be denied. We must\\nnot falter until this goal is achieved. In 2011, Austria\\nwas elected to the Human Rights Council. We fully\\nsupport the Council and its mechanisms, especially the\\nuniversal periodic review. The Council is best placed\\nto react swiftly in case of human rights emergencies.\\nIts special sessions on Syria and Libya illustrated that\\nthe international community will not turn a blind eye\\non gross human rights violations and indiscriminate\\nattacks against the civilian population. Human rights\\nabuses must not go unpunished. Violations must be\\nthoroughly investigated and perpetrators must be\\nheld accountable before credible judicial institutions,\\nincluding the International Criminal Court.\\nOur membership of the Human Rights Council\\nis an opportunity to continue working on the key\\npriorities that Austria pursued during its Security\\nCouncil membership in 2009 and 2010: the protection of\\ncivilians, the safety of journalists, the implementation\\nof resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security,\\nthe freedom of religion and belief, and the protection of\\nchildren from violence and abuse.\\nThe High-level Meeting of 24 September was an\\nimportant opportunity to renew our commitment to\\nthe rule of law at the national and international levels.\\nIt now needs an adequate follow-up. As chair of the\\nGroup of Friends of the Rule of Law, Austria will\\nprovide concrete proposals for the upcoming report of\\nthe Secretary-General.\\nThe various United Nations headquarters in Vienna\\nare a hub for promoting peace and security. The work\\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency is more\\nrelevant than ever. I am pleased that we can now also\\ndraw on additional services from the new office of the\\nOffice for Disarmament Affairs established in Vienna.\\nAustria is deeply concerned about programmes\\nfor weapons of mass destruction and proliferation\\nactivities in several regions of the world. The creation\\nof a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of\\nmass destruction in the Middle East is more urgent than\\never. In that respect, let me underline that Iran must\\nfinally give credible evidence for the peaceful nature of\\nits nuclear programmeme and engage in earnest in the\\ntalks with the European Union three plus one group.\\nThe continued inability to even initiate substantive  multilateral disarmament negotiations is unacceptable.\\nAustria is committed to working with other interested\\nStates to move forward on that crucial issue. I would\\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his continued\\nsupport in that matter.\\nWe need to move beyond a strictly military security\\napproach that originates from the Cold War period. It\\nis time to change the discourse on nuclear weapons.\\nAny use of nuclear weapons would be devastating for\\nthe whole world in its humanitarian and environmental\\neffects. In the twenty-first century, such an existential\\nthreat to humankind can no longer be handled\\nexclusively by a few States as a national security matter.\\nAustria is committed to strengthening and further\\ndeveloping international law and a humanitarian\\napproach to advance the global disarmament and\\nnon-proliferation agenda. A lot has been achieved in\\nthe past two decades, as evidenced by the successful\\nconclusions of the conventions to ban anti-personnel\\nmines and cluster munitions. We hope that similar\\nprogress can be achieved on the arms trade treaty in the\\ncoming months. Other Member States should join the\\nemerging consensus on regulating the trade in arms in\\na comprehensive manner.\\nVienna and its United Nations headquarters also\\nserve as a platform for the discussion on sustainable\\ndevelopment. We welcome the decision of the Secretary-\\nGeneral to establish an implementation office for his\\nSustainable Energy for All initiative. That will help\\nto advance this important agenda. Universal access to\\nenergy and the improvement of energy efficiency, along\\nwith a higher share of renewable energy, are goals that\\nwill help bring electricity to the billion and a half people\\nworldwide lacking access. Equally, it will help control\\ngreenhouse gas emissions and global warming, which\\nthreaten the very existence of many Member States.\\nThis year’s United Nations Conference on\\nSustainable Development marked the beginning of a\\nnew era, renewing the prospects for future generations\\nvia the sustainable development goals, as tailored to\\nthe needs of different countries or groups of States\\nand regions. While implementing those new global\\ngoals, we should not cease our efforts to achieve the\\nMillennium Development Goals by the target date of\\n2015.\\nAustria remains fully committed to an effective\\nmultilateral system. Therefore we will support the\\nefforts of the President of the Assembly and of the\\nSecretary-General to further increase the effectiveness\\nof our Organization in order to better enable us to face\\nthe challenges of our time.', '\\ufeffLast month, I visited\\na refugee camp at the border between Turkey and Syria.\\nI met children, women and men, who told me how they\\nhad escaped the violence and suffering in their home\\ncountry. They had f led the bloodshed of a regime that\\nis using indiscriminate violence against its own people.\\nThey had f led a country where children are being\\ntortured, women raped and innocent civilians killed.\\nThey had lost their friends, family and homes, but they\\nhad not lost hope for a better future.\\nOne of the people whom I met near the border was\\nMedya, the 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old girl.\\nShe had f led the city of Homs eight months earlier.\\nNow, she travels back and forth between Homs and a\\nrefugee camp in Turkey at great personal danger. She\\nrisks her life to report to the world on the situation in\\nSyria. Her reports are broadcast on major international\\nnetworks.\\nMedya told me about the terrible events that she had\\nwitnessed. I was touched by her sorrow and impressed\\nby her determination. Her strong desire for freedom is\\nsomething to which we can all relate. Those who have\\nstruggled for freedom do not give up easily. However,\\nit is also clear that those refugees need the support of\\nthe international community at large. They need food,\\nshelter and security. Ultimately, they need an effective\\nUnited Nations and a strong international legal order.\\nPromoting the international legal order is enshrined\\nin the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\\nIt is a mission that we share with many in this Assembly.\\nTogether with 49 other countries, we are helping to\\nestablish legal order and security in Afghanistan, for\\nexample. I want to pay tribute to the Dutch and the\\nother men and women, soldiers and civilians, currently\\nserving there.\\nThe Hague, a city of peace and justice, is known\\nfor its contribution to the international legal order. It\\nis home to the International Court of Justice and the\\nPermanent Court of Arbitration, which are both based at the Peace Palace. Next year, we will proudly celebrate\\nits centenary. Former Secretary-General Boutros\\nBoutros-Ghali recognized the role of the Netherlands\\nin the international legal order by naming The Hague\\nthe legal capital of the world.\\nWe need international law to protect people,\\nsocieties and nations, or, as former Secretary-General\\nKofi Annan recently wrote, the United Nations Charter\\nwas issued in the name of we the peoples, not we the\\nGovernments. So we need a stronger international legal\\norder, first, to preserve peace and security; secondly,\\nto protect freedom; and thirdly, to promote prosperity.\\nThat is the task that we face.\\nA strong international legal order helps to preserve\\npeace and security. To achieve that goal, we need\\ngreater unity. I regret the persistent disagreement in the\\nSecurity Council. It has prevented the United Nations\\nfrom taking decisive action on Syria. The world is\\nin desperate need of a strong, united and determined\\nSecurity Council.\\nMediation, arbitration and judicial settlement are\\nindispensable for the peaceful settlement of conflicts.\\nWe should cherish and develop those tools, as Deputy\\nSecretary-General Jan Eliasson has so rightly said.\\nBetter implementation of existing treaties on\\nnon-proliferation, arms control and disarmament is of\\nparamount importance.\\nAn effective international legal order means that\\ncountries are bound by their promises. Iran must\\ncompletely fulfil its International Atomic Energy\\nAgency obligations and abide by Security Council\\nresolutions. The burden of proof is on Iran. As I said\\nto my Iranian colleague, Minister Salehi, earlier this\\nweek: You are the one to convince the world of the\\npeaceful character of your nuclear programme — not\\nus.\\nThe international agendas on nuclear, chemical and\\nconventional weapons must lead to concrete results and\\nnew treaties. The United Nations and the Conference\\non Disarmament in Geneva need to do better.\\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\\nWeapons in The Hague will this year celebrate its\\nfifteenth anniversary. It should stand ready to assist in\\naddressing the chemical weapons problem in Syria.\\nThe Netherlands will host the next Nuclear Security\\nSummit, in 2014, as part of our efforts to enhance\\nsecurity and fight nuclear terrorism. Negotiations on a robust and effective arms trade\\ntreaty should recommence as soon as possible.\\nA stronger legal order also promotes freedom. It\\npromotes human rights, reinforces the responsibility to\\nprotect and helps prevent atrocities. Greater freedom\\nmeans equal rights for men and women alike. Women\\nmake up 50 per cent of humankind. We need the full\\n100 per cent of humankind. It is in every country’s\\nown interest to make sure that women are actively\\ninvolved in society, the economy and politics. They\\nmust participate in the power structures as leaders of\\nthe world.\\nHuman rights cannot be imposed from the outside.\\nBut Governments carry the responsibility for observing\\ntheir international human rights obligations and\\ncommitments. There is therefore a need to communicate\\nconstantly about the obligations and commitments.\\nThe role of the Human Rights Council in promoting\\nfreedom is crucial. We need to improve the way in which\\nit functions. Countries that aspire to join the Council\\nshould be genuinely committed to respecting human\\nrights. I am proud to reiterate our genuine commitment\\nand to announce the Dutch candidature for the Human\\nRights Council from 2015 to 2017.\\nPeople should be free to live their lives in peace\\nand security. Therefore, every State has an obligation to\\nprevent aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity\\nand war crimes. Prevention is key. But if countries\\ncannot or will not act, the international community has\\na responsibility to protect.\\nA strong international and domestic legal order\\npromotes prosperity and, let me state it emphatically,\\neconomic growth. Trade, investment, innovation and\\neconomic development will all benefit from a stable,\\npredictable and rules-based business climate.\\nThe economy cannot thrive in societies where\\nhuman rights are violated, corruption is rampant and\\nGovernment revenues are wasted. That is one of the\\nlessons of the Arab awakening. Sustainable prosperity\\nand sustainable economic growth depend upon a strong,\\nlegitimate and reliable legal order.\\nFor that matter, free trade agreements and a well-\\nfunctioning World Trade Organization are crucial for\\nstimulating growth. According to the World Bank, a\\nnew global trade deal would increase global welfare\\ntremendously.\\n\\nA good way to promote foreign direct investment\\nis by enhancing arbitration and conflict resolution\\nmechanisms. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in\\nThe Hague has an increasingly important role to play.\\nProtecting intellectual property rights effectively\\nfosters innovation. We should therefore strengthen the\\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization.\\nFinally, the Millennium Development Goals need a\\nnew agenda, with bold ideas to end poverty and plans to\\npromote sustainable development and foster economic\\ngrowth. The private sector is crucial to achieving\\nthose goals, especially when it comes to unlocking the\\npotential of small and medium-sized enterprises. To\\nquote renowned economist Paul Collier, “We cannot\\nmake poverty history unless the countries of the bottom\\nbillion start to grow”.\\nThe United Nations is indispensable for the agenda\\nof peace, freedom and prosperity. The widening gap\\nbetween the increasing expectations we have of the\\nUnited Nations, on the one hand, and of its capacity\\nto deliver, on the other, is a cause of serious concern.\\nTherefore, we need a more effective, efficient and\\ncoherent United Nations.\\nThe Security Council must act decisively when\\nserious crimes are involved and international peace and\\nsecurity are at stake. All United Nations organizations\\nshould deliver as one. The Secretary-General’s reform\\nproposals must be implemented.\\nEmerging Powers rightly ask for more influence,\\ndue to new political and economic realities. The\\nSecurity Council should be reformed while taking those\\nrealities into account. At the same time, the larger share\\nof those emerging Powers in the world economy should\\nbe reflected in the relative contributions of Member\\nStates to the United Nations budget.\\nThe Members of the United Nations need to take\\naction in five areas. First, countries should respect\\nuniversal human rights without distinction. That\\nkey principle also applies to lesbian, gay, bisexual\\nand transgender individuals. Secondly, the rights of\\nreligious minorities should be guaranteed all over the\\nworld. Governments should protect religious groups\\nagainst violence. Thirdly, countries should recognize\\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court\\nof Justice, as the Secretary-General has requested.\\nFourthly, countries should adhere to the principle of\\nthe responsibility to protect. That applies to prevention, protection and prosecution. Fifthly, countries that have\\nnot done so to date should join the International Criminal\\nCourt. That will ensure that civilians are protected and\\nthe perpetrators of atrocities are prosecuted.\\nThat takes me back to Syria. The Syrian crisis\\nhighlights the mounting challenges of the United\\nNations and its States Members. I applaud the active\\nstance of the Secretary-General with regard to Syria.\\nThe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\\nAffairs, the World Food Programme, the Office of\\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\\nand many other organizations are providing crucial\\nassistance to the victims of the violence. I want to pay\\nexplicit tribute to the Governments of Turkey, Lebanon\\nand Jordan for their invaluable efforts to alleviate the\\nsuffering of the thousands of refugees.\\nIn conclusion, for me, meeting Мedya, that\\ncourageous Syrian journalist and mother, has given a\\nvoice to those refugees. I hope that I will meet Medya,\\nthat 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old child, again\\nin the near future in Homs, Syria. I want to see her live\\nin an inclusive and prosperous Syria, where democracy\\nand human rights replace terror and violence. It is about\\ndemocracy and human rights. That is our aim. I want\\nto see her live in a Syria where jobs and economic\\nopportunities have replaced poverty and despair.\\nThat woman, Мedya, has already shown the courage\\nand the will to contribute to Syria’s future. Together,\\nwe, the peoples of the United Nations, should show\\nthat same courage. Together, we must preserve peace,\\nprotect freedom and promote prosperity. Together, let\\nus build a stronger international legal order.', '\\ufeffTen years ago, Switzerland joined the United Nations,\\nthus becoming both the 190th Member State and the\\nfirst country in which United Nations membership\\nwas approved by its citizens in a popular vote. The\\nUnited Nations and Switzerland share the same values\\nand pursue common goals: the promotion of peace\\nand security, sustainable development, the protection\\nand promotion of human rights, and the provision of\\nemergency relief to victims of conflict and natural\\ndisasters.\\nWe face significant and pressing challenges\\nin all these areas. Climate change, food and water\\nscarcity, migration, organized crime, terrorism and the\\nproliferation of weapons do not respect borders. These\\nare global challenges that threaten entire regions. In an\\nincreasingly interconnected world, we have to search\\nfor global solutions that respond to regional and national\\nneeds. It is not enough to simply maintain the status\\nquo. We have to find today the solutions of tomorrow.\\n\\nThe United Nations spans the entire world. Its\\nuniversality gives it unparalleled legitimacy and\\nenables it to find and implement solutions to global\\nchallenges that enjoy broad support. In view of the\\ngrowing interdependence of those challenges, the\\nUnited Nations is now more important than ever. It must\\nbe at the heart of international governance. The support\\nof every Member State and every one of us is therefore\\ncrucial. In order to accomplish the Herculean tasks\\nawaiting it, the United Nations can no longer settle for\\nthe lowest common denominator, as it does all too often\\nwhen consensus is reached among its Members. If the\\nUnited Nations is to overcome the challenges facing it,\\nit must be efficient, innovative and active. What does\\nthat mean?\\nThe United Nations is efficient when it updates and\\nimproves its processes so that it can act more rapidly\\nand in a more coordinated manner, despite growing\\nbudgetary pressures. In this respect, Switzerland\\nsupports the reform agenda of the Secretary-General. It\\nshould be implemented swiftly.\\nThe United Nations is innovative when it develops\\nnew ideas and solutions that are tailored to the big\\npicture. United Nations structures have evolved\\norganically over past decades. They do not encourage\\npeople to stray from the beaten path. More intensive\\nexchanges within the United Nations and between the\\nOrganization and scientific circles, civil society and\\nthe private sector promote creativity and ensure broad\\nsupport for United Nations activities. At the seat of\\nthe United Nations in Geneva that type of exchange\\nis encouraged in a targeted manner. Switzerland\\nalso supports the strengthening and development of\\nref lection and research activities within the United\\nNations. Bringing those activities together in Geneva\\nwould further strengthen the creative potential of the\\nOrganization.\\nFinally, the United Nations will show its strengths\\nif it can achieve consensus in conflict situations and\\npush through to find solutions. Resorting to the right\\nof the veto in the Security Council is difficult to justify\\nin the event of genocide, war crimes or crimes against\\nhumanity. That is why Switzerland, together with\\nother countries, continues to clamour for reform of the\\nworking methods of the Security Council. Transparency\\nand the Council’s collaboration with other bodies within\\nthe Organization should be improved, and the right of\\nveto should be limited.\\n\\nAs Switzerland traditionally defends dialogue, we\\ncall upon all States and peoples to commit to greater\\nunderstanding and peaceful coexistence among\\ncultures, religions and beliefs. Freedom of belief and\\nreligion, like freedom of opinion and expression,\\nare universally guaranteed core values that must be\\nprotected and respected. Moreover, responding to an\\nunpleasant opinion with violence can never be justified.\\nIt must be countered by ideas and logical arguments,\\nand if necessary through legal recourse, especially if\\nnational, religious or cultural hatred has been incited.\\nThe attacks in recent weeks against diplomatic missions\\nare therefore unacceptable regardless of the motivation\\nbehind them. We all bear a common responsibility to\\npromote tolerance and the respect for beliefs.\\nFor the current session of the General Assembly,\\nthe President has chosen as the theme for the high-level\\ndebate “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of\\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.\\nI applaud his choice. In recent years, the United Nations\\nhas strengthened its capacity in the area of mediation\\nand preventive diplomacy, which has brought about a\\nre-evaluation of mediation processes. We need to go\\nfurther, however, as most of the United Nations budget\\ncontinues to be spent on peacekeeping operations.\\nSwitzerland is therefore convinced that greater\\ninvestment in peaceful means that could bring about\\na settlement of disputes, especially through mediation\\nand preventive diplomacy, would pay off in the long\\nrun. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure;\\nthat is as true for States as it is for people.\\nIt is not just a matter of funding. Every single\\nconflict that is averted means the avoidance of human\\nsuffering and the non-interruption of development in the\\ncountries concerned. Over the past decade, Switzerland\\nhas actively participated in more than 30 mediation\\nprocesses in some 20 countries. Moreover, Switzerland\\nregularly makes its experts and know-how available to\\nthe United Nations and hopes to see its collaboration\\nwith the Organization grow. Adapted to current needs,\\nspecial political missions respond to the complexity of\\npolitical realities. Thanks to those missions, the United\\nNations is in a position to react f lexibly and quickly\\nin the event of a constitutional crisis or a coup d’état.\\nAs the main instruments of preventive diplomacy, such\\nmissions should be strengthened, specifically through\\nthe introduction of modalities, financing and optimal\\nsupport.\\n\\nWhen prevention is not enough, the international\\ncommunity must act firmly. The United Nations should\\ntherefore demonstrate that it is capable of intervening\\nand imposing itself. Switzerland is deeply concerned by\\nthe dramatic worsening of the situation in Syria, where\\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law are\\nbeing f louted. At this very moment, as I speak, innocent\\npeople are dying from bullets fired by the Syrian army\\nand the armed opposition. Thousands of people have\\nbeen killed, more than 1 million are on the run in their\\nown country and some 250,000 have sought refuge\\nin neighbouring countries. It is difficult, maybe even\\nimpossible, to reach hundreds of thousands of victims\\nwho, wounded and traumatized, are condemned to wait\\nin zones under siege. United Nations agencies estimate\\nthat approximately 2.5 million people need urgent\\nhumanitarian assistance. Switzerland has therefore set\\naside more than $15 million for humanitarian assistance\\nin Syria and neighbouring countries.\\nAs long as human rights continue to be trampled upon\\nand those responsible are not sufficiently perturbed, it\\nwill be impossible to guarantee security. Switzerland\\ntherefore calls for the perpetrators of serious violations\\nof human rights answer for their actions. The impunity\\nof perpetrators is not just immoral; by compromising\\nthe process of reconciliation that gets under way in a\\nsociety after a war, it encourages history to repeat itself.\\nSwitzerland leads a group of some 30 countries\\nthat are asking that the International Criminal Court\\ntake up the case of Syria. I would invite all heads of\\nState and Government present here today to rally to that\\ninitiative. The international community must be made\\naware of the extent of human rights violations in Syria.\\nSwitzerland welcomes the work of the commission\\nof inquiry set up by the Human Rights Council and\\ncalls for it to be strengthened. It also welcomes the\\nappointment of Mr. Brahimi as the new Joint Special\\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League of\\nArab States for the Syrian crisis and will do its utmost\\nto help him find a political solution to the conflict in\\nthat country.\\nWe know that our use of the world’s available\\nresources is not sustainable at the global level. We\\nare exploiting those resources without concern for\\nthe future. We also know that human beings are the\\ncause of climate change. The fate of our planet rests in\\nour hands. Much will depend on whether we succeed\\nin making the transition to sustainable development\\nand whether we succeed in moving towards a green\\neconomy. The Rio+20 outcome document provides us\\nwith an opportunity that we must embrace. We must act\\ntoday so that future generations do not have to pay the\\nprice for our inaction.\\nHowever, a great deal of mutual distrust remains, as\\ndoes the fear that not everyone will be able to compete\\non equal terms in a green economy. We must overcome\\nthat hurdle. Switzerland will play its part in sharing the\\nburden of efforts between the North and the South. The\\nGreen Climate Fund will be a key element in financing\\nthat transition. It should therefore be set up without\\ndelay and in an optimal environment. I am convinced\\nthat Geneva can offer such an environment.\\nThe transition to a green economy also requires\\nnew approaches, in terms of both thinking and acting.\\nIn any process of change, there are winners and losers.\\nHowever, with regard to sustainable development\\nthe winners and losers are the same, namely, future\\ngenerations. Either they will be able to continue to live\\nin an intact environment where they benefit from the\\nnatural resources they need, or they will have to put\\nup with a decline in the standard of living due to the\\nexhaustion of resources and the broad consequences of\\nclimate change. Our common challenge lies in ensuring\\nthe well-being of all without overexploiting our natural\\nresources.\\nSwitzerland attaches the greatest importance to\\nthe post-2015 agenda, which will allow us to benefit\\nfrom our experience with the Millennium Development\\nGoals in order to prepare for the future. That approach\\ngives us the opportunity to consider all dimensions of\\nsustainable development together and, for the first time\\never, develop a universal system of targets for the well-\\nbeing of future generations throughout the world.\\nSwitzerland is convinced that setting sustainable\\ndevelopment goals is an important element in\\nstrengthening that development. It will play an active\\npart in defining a new system of goals. Switzerland\\nbelieves it imperative to combine discussions on the\\npost-2015 agenda and on sustainable development goals\\ninto a single process.\\nAccording to the Roman philosopher Seneca, it is\\nnot that we have a short space of time, but that we waste\\nmuch of it. So let us today take on the great challenges\\nbefore us. Let us join forces to bring about more peace\\nand security in the world and better protect human rights.\\nLet us put an end to the impunity of the perpetrators of\\nserious human rights abuses and bring them to account.\\n\\nLet us take bold steps for more sustainable development\\nin the interests of our children and grandchildren. And\\nlet us strengthen the United Nations so that, as the only\\ntruly universal Organization, it is better equipped to\\naddress those immense challenges.', '\\ufeffFreedom,\\ndignity, self-determination and the hope of a better\\nlife were the driving forces behind the movement for\\nchange in the Arab world.\\nAs Germans, we know from our own bitter\\nexperience that freedom is not a gift. It has to be won\\nand constantly defended. Freedom is more than just\\nfreedom of thought. It is freedom to express one’s own\\nopinion and to voice public criticism. For that reason\\nalone, freedom is not always comfortable. The first\\narticle of the Basic Law, Germany’s Constitution,\\nstates that human dignity shall be inviolable. That\\napplies to every single individual, regardless of their\\norigin, culture, creed or sex. As Germans, we have\\nexperienced what it is to lack freedom in the course of\\nour own history. We will always stand by those who,\\nwherever they are in the world, call for freedom of\\nopinion, religion, the press and artistic freedom.\\n\\nFreedom has a daughter; it is tolerance. And\\nfreedom has a son; it is respect, respect for other people,\\nrespect for what is important to others, respect for what\\nis sacred to others. Freedom therefore does not mean\\nfreedom from responsibility. Freedom always means\\nfreedom to shoulder responsibility.\\nWe understand the many devout people who feel\\nwounded by the recent shameful anti-Islam video.\\nHowever, legitimate criticism and sincere indignation\\ncannot be used to justify acts of violence or destruction.\\nSome would have us believe that the burning of embassy\\nbuildings are proof of a clash of civilizations. We must\\nnot allow ourselves to be deluded by such arguments.\\nThe vast majority of people oppose violence. The\\npeople who have taken to the streets, as well as their\\npolitical representatives gathered here in New York\\nthis week, have expressed that forcefully. It is not a\\nclash of civilizations. It is a clash within societies and\\ncivilizations. It is also a struggle for the soul of the\\nmovement for change in the Arab world.\\nIt is a struggle between open and closed minds,\\nbetween moderates and radicals, between understanding\\nand hate. It is a clash between those seeking peace and\\nthose prepared to resort to violence. The extremists\\nwant to prevent the emergence of freedom by inciting\\nviolence. They must not be allowed to succeed.\\nGermany has taken a stand in that struggle. We will\\ncontinue to expand our support for people in the Arab\\nworld. We are not going to turn our backs on them, but\\nwe will be open to them. Our values and our interests\\ncompel us to take the side of those around the world who\\nare fighting peacefully for freedom, dignity and self-\\ndetermination. Education and work, investment and\\ngrowth — our offer of a transformational partnership\\nstill stands.\\nI will never forget the Syrian father who held out\\nhis emaciated son to me during my visit to the Zaatari\\nrefugee camp in Jordan. Such suffering renders us\\nspeechless, but it also impels us to act. To this very\\nday, the Security Council has failed to live up to its\\nresponsibility for the people in Syria. I express that\\ncriticism with great sadness. The deadlock in the\\nSecurity Council must not continue. Every day, the\\nviolence perpetrated by the Bashar Al-Assad regime\\nis escalating. The risk of a conf lagration engulfing the\\nentire region is growing. Together with our partners and\\nthe United Nations, we are helping the many refugees\\nin Syria itself and in neighbouring countries.\\n\\nAll Syrians who want their country to have a\\ndemocratic and pluralistic future based on the rule\\nof law must work together. We support the efforts of\\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of\\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States, to\\nfind a political approach. Despite the escalating violence\\nand despite the deadlock in the Security Council, we\\nmust not stop working on a political solution.\\nDuring the past 20 months, the Arab League\\nhas demonstrated ever more clearly its adherence\\nto the values enshrined in the Charter of the United\\nNations. We welcome that and we want to build on\\nit. At Germany’s initiative, during the last week in\\nSeptember, the Security Council welcomed intensifying\\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\\nLeague of Arab States (see S/PRST/2012/20). That is\\nan acknowledgement of the Arab League’s constructive\\nand positive role.\\nWe also pay tribute to the efforts to gain freedom in\\nother parts of the world. As a result of the remarkable\\nopening-up process under way in Myanmar, the country\\nis emerging from isolation and gradually leaving\\nrepression behind.\\nWe criticize and strongly condemn the ongoing\\nrepression in our own neighbourhood, in Belarus.\\nIn many other Asian and African countries, which\\nhave struck out in a new direction, we are supporting\\npolitical transformation by providing assistance for\\neconomic and social development. That is in the\\ncommon interest of the international community. For\\nthere is one thing that becomes ever more apparent, and\\nthat is that without development, there can be no security\\nand without security there can be no development. That\\napplies to our engagement in Afghanistan, which we\\nwill continue after the withdrawal of combat troops in\\n2014. It also applies to the efforts to bring stability to\\nSomalia and Yemen, to the Great Lakes region and to\\nthe countries of the Sahel.\\nWe are very concerned by the still-unresolved\\ndispute about Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran has still\\nnot produced evidence of the exclusively peaceful\\nnature of its nuclear programme. It has also failed to\\ndate to provide the transparency that the International\\nAtomic Energy Agency has long demanded. So far, the\\ntalks during the last few months have not made enough\\nprogress towards reaching a solution. The European\\nUnion’s three plus three group has put forward\\nproposals for a substantive negotiation process. We still\\nawait a serious response from Iran. We want a political\\nand diplomatic solution. Time is short. Israel’s security\\nis at stake. Indeed, stability in the entire region is at\\nstake. However, that is also about averting the risk of\\na nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences\\nfor international security. I call on Iran to stop playing\\nfor time. The situation is serious indeed, and time is\\nrunning out. We want a political solution, and we are\\nputting all our efforts into achieving that goal.\\nThose challenges must not lead us to lose sight of\\nthe necessity of a negotiated peace settlement between\\nIsrael and the Palestinians. There is a danger that the\\ngoal of a two-State solution, the only solution that can\\nreconcile the legitimate interests of the two sides, will\\nslip away. The two sides must build new trust. At the\\nsame time, they must refrain from doing anything that\\nmight jeopardize a two-State solution.\\nGermany’s foreign policy is a policy for peace.\\nGermany’s foreign policy is anchored in Europe. Many\\nhave been wondering whether Europe can successfully\\nmanage its sovereign debt crisis and whether it will\\ncontinue to play a leading role in the world. The answer\\nis an emphatic yes. Europe has a great responsibility in\\nthe world. And Germany is aware of its responsibility\\nfor Europe. The way out of the debt crisis is difficult. It\\nrequires spending discipline, solidarity and growth. We\\nwill continue down that road. Europe is growing closer\\ntogether. Europe is consolidating. Europe will emerge\\nfrom the crisis stronger than ever before. Europe will\\nremain a force to be reckoned with as the world’s largest\\ndonor of development assistance, as an inspiration for\\npeaceful regional cooperation, as a pioneer in climate\\naction and disarmament, as a champion of rules-based\\nglobalization and as a driving force for United Nations\\nreform.\\nMy country’s peaceful unification more than 20\\nyears ago also signified the reunification of Europe.\\nSince then, the world has changed dramatically. Today,\\nwe find ourselves on the threshold of a multipolar\\nworld. The world with its interdependencies needs a\\ncooperative order. It needs strong and representative\\ninstitutions. We will weaken the Security Council if\\nwe fail to adapt it to today’s world. Together with our\\npartners in the G-4 group, India, Brazil and Japan,\\nGermany is prepared to assume greater responsibility.\\nIt cannot be that Latin America and Africa have\\nno permanent seats on the Security Council or that\\ndynamic Asia has only one. That does not reflect the realities of today’s world, and it definitely does not\\nreflect the realities of tomorrow.\\nThe challenges are too great for us to simply\\naccept the status quo. The world is not only growing\\ntogether; the pace of change is increasing. We are\\nliving in an age of breathtaking change. That change\\nbrings with it risks and new dangers, as well as new\\nuncertainties. Above all, however, that change brings\\nwith it great opportunities, especially for young people.\\nIn this changing world we need a clear compass, and\\nour compass is freedom. The yearning for freedom is\\nrooted in people’s hearts all over the world. They are\\nour partners in building a better future.', 'This year, we \\ncelebrate the centennial of the Peace Palace in The \\nHague, seat of the International Court of Justice (ICC) \\nand the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and symbol of \\nthe pursuit of peace by means of law. Next year, we will \\ncommemorate the centennial of the first of two suicidal \\nworld wars that caused unspeakable human suffering, \\nhorrible crimes against humanity and the oppression of \\nhalf of Europe’s population until the Berlin wall came \\ndown in 1989.\\n\\nOut of the ashes of those global conflagrations \\ngrew the desire of the peoples of the world to put an end \\nto violent conflict and to guarantee human rights for \\nevery human being in every country. “Never again” is \\nwhat humankind wanted. Unfortunately, so far it is not \\nwhat we have been able to deliver to everyone.\\n\\nDuring the festive celebrations this year in The \\nHague, which gave fresh impetus to the peaceful \\nsettlement of disputes, there were scenes of unspeakable \\nviolence in Syria, including the use of chemical \\nweapons. More recently, in Nairobi, dozens of people \\nwere killed by terrorists. One of the victims was Dr. \\nElif Yavuz, a young Dutch woman who was eight \\nmonths pregnant with her first baby. My heart goes out \\nto Dr. Yavuz’s family, to all the victims of the Nairobi \\nattack and to their loved ones.\\n\\nThe powerlessness of the international community \\nto put an end to abuses like those has led in the past \\nto the establishment of new bodies and instruments. \\nAfter the Second World War, the United Nations was \\nfounded and the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights was adopted. Following more recent genocides, \\nthe International Criminal Court was established. The \\nuse of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein led to the \\nChemical Weapons Convention and the Organization \\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). \\nSo the institutions and instruments are in place. The \\nquestion is, what is preventing them from delivering \\nresults? Perhaps the answer to the question was given \\nalready four centuries ago by Dutch philosopher Baruch \\nSpinoza when he wrote: “Peace is not an absence of \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nwar; it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for \\nbenevolence, confidence, justice”.\\n\\nIt is my conviction that the international community \\nmust keep working on the project we launched a hundred \\nyears ago. We should follow the example of Dr. Yavuz, \\nwho was committed to helping people suffering from \\nHIV/AIDS and malaria. We should work to achieve \\nher aims and uphold her ideals. We should make clear \\nthat terrorism will never triumph. We should invest in \\nthe United Nations and support it as effectively as we \\ncan. We strongly support the Secretary-General and \\nthe message he delivered here on Tuesday (A/68/PV.5). \\nWe will join him on the road to peace, justice and \\ndevelopment.\\n\\nThe Netherlands advocates a coherent agenda for \\nstrengthening the international legal order. A peaceful \\nworld demands a sustainable legal order and a powerful \\nagenda for development. It demands a strategy for \\ndisarmament and a focus on human rights. Those are \\nthe principles of the foreign policy of the Netherlands. \\nA partnership for peace, justice and development is the \\ncornerstone of the Dutch candidacy for a non-permanent \\nseat in the Security Council in 2017-2018.\\n\\nThe world was shocked to discover that an attack \\nwith chemical weapons had taken place in Syria \\non 21 August. The attack violated one of the most \\nimportant peremptory norms of international law. The \\n1925 Geneva Protocol, to which Syria is a party, bans \\nthe use of chemical weapons. The situation in Syria \\nposes a clear threat to international peace and security. \\nThe Netherlands calls on the Security Council to take \\nconcerted action to address that threat. We have just \\nheard from the representative of Australia what is going \\nto happen today.\\n\\nSyria does not comply with the international \\nnorm that requires it to protect its citizens. But the \\ninternational community also has a responsibility. \\nThe Netherlands supports the proposal that permanent \\nSecurity Council members should henceforth refrain \\nfrom using their veto power in votes on intervention \\nto stop the mass atrocity crimes identified by the \\n2005 World Summit. They should show that they are \\nserious about their responsibility to protect vulnerable \\npopulations, underlining our consensus that genocide, \\nwar crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic \\ncleansing must never be tolerated.\\n\\nAs the Secretary-General said, those responsible \\nfor the atrocities in Syria should be held accountable in \\naccordance with international law. The use of chemical \\nweapons is a war crime under the Rome Statute. If the \\nSyrian Government itself sees no possibility of tracking \\ndown and prosecuting the guilty parties, it can ask the \\nICC to do so. If Syria makes no request, the Security \\nCouncil must take action. Finally, as the Secretary-\\nGeneral also said, we can hardly be satisfied with the \\ndestruction of chemical weapons while the wider war \\ncontinues to destroy Syria and kill innocent people. A \\npeaceful solution is needed. And the women of Syria \\nshould be involved in making that happen, as there can \\nbe no solution without them.\\n\\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \\npeace and security provides an outstanding tool for \\npromoting inclusive conflict resolution. This week we \\nhosted a side event marking the importance of women’s \\npolitical participation for successful transitions in the \\nMiddle East and North Africa. The Executive Director \\nof UN-Women told me earlier this week that courage \\nis every woman’s middle name. It certainly is in Syria.\\n\\nThe Netherlands supports John Kerry’s efforts to \\nencourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to arrive \\nat a two-State solution through direct negotiations. The \\ninternational community should support the Israeli-\\nPalestinian talks. Only a political solution can lead to \\nlasting peace.\\n\\nFifty years ago, United States President John F. \\nKennedy expressed the fear that in the 1970s there \\nwould be 15, 20 or even 25 nuclear-weapon States. \\nThanks in part to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \\nof Nuclear Weapons, that danger was averted, but the \\nrisk of further proliferation of nuclear weapons has not \\nreceded. While much has been achieved in the field \\nof disarmament, there is still a long way to go. In his \\nspeech in Berlin in June, President Obama warned of \\nthe danger of nuclear weapons. “As long as nuclear \\nweapons exist, we are not truly safe”, he said — and he \\nis right. He plans to take new steps to reduce strategic \\nnuclear arsenals. He also wants to make substantial \\nreductions in the number of United States and Russian \\nnon-strategic weapons in Europe. The Netherlands is in \\nfavour of those steps, strongly supports the efforts and \\nwants to contribute to them.\\n\\nIn March of next year, the Nuclear Security Summit \\nwill convene in The Hague. My country’s hosting of the \\nSummit is in keeping with our tradition as a country of \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\npeace, justice and security. Nuclear materials can play \\nan important role in curing our illnesses and heating \\nour homes. And fortunately, the likelihood of terrorists \\nusing nuclear materials in an attack is small. But if it \\ndid happen, the consequences for the world would be \\nvery serious indeed.\\n\\nThe Nuclear Security Summit is meant to give \\nfresh impetus to global efforts to ensure nuclear \\nsecurity and prevent nuclear terrorism by making and \\nimplementing agreements at the highest multilateral \\nlevel. Governments, businesses, researchers and \\norganizations from many countries are working \\ntogether to reduce the quantities of nuclear materials, \\nto enhance the security of the materials that remain, \\nand to combat nuclear smuggling.\\n\\nThe centennial of the Peace Palace is a good \\noccasion to highlight the peaceful settlement of \\ndisputes. The Netherlands has used the celebrations \\nto strengthen instruments for peaceful settlement. We \\nadvocate taking three interrelated steps.\\n\\nFirst, we need to encourage countries to recognize \\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court \\nof Justice. As States Members of the United Nations, \\nwe recognize the Court as a principal organ of the \\nUnited Nations. In my view, recognizing its compulsory \\njurisdiction is a logical and necessary next step. \\nSecondly, we must help countries realize how useful \\nand flexible arbitration is as a way of settling disputes. \\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly could \\ndraw parties’ attention to that instrument more often \\nand we should advocate it more often in the public \\ndebate. Thirdly, we must reduce the obstacles to the \\npeaceful settlement of disputes by making alternatives \\navailable. This is why the Netherlands enthusiastically \\nsupports the Department of Political Affairs and \\nnon-governmental organization that promote mediation.\\n\\nIn his 2011 report on the responsibility to protect \\n(A/65/877), the Secretary-General rightly pointed \\nout the importance of mediation as a means of \\npreventing atrocity crimes. National legal systems \\nare the foundation of the international legal order. \\nStrengthening national legal systems should make it \\npossible to keep the courtrooms of the International \\nCriminal Court closed.\\n\\nThe ICC is inextricably linked to the global chain \\nof legal institutions. It delivers justice in the wake of \\ninternational crimes, thus helping to prevent future \\noffences. So it is crucial that countries continue to \\naccede to the Rome Statute and that popular support \\nfor it be maintained. We need to ensure that countries \\nthat have acceded to the Statute continue to work with \\nthe ICC.\\n\\nThis year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of \\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \\ntwentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration. \\nThe Universal Declaration is an enduring source of \\ninspiration. It was adopted without a single dissenting \\nvote under the inspired leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, \\nwho acted as a change agent before the expression \\nwas coined. Just before the vote she said, “We stand \\ntoday at the threshold of a great event both in the life \\nof the United Nations and in the life of mankind” (see \\nA/PV.180).\\n\\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in \\nVienna underlined that human rights are universal, \\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. Twenty \\nyears after Vienna, the blueprints of our human rights \\ninfrastructure are complete. Now it is time to ensure \\nthe necessary implementation, political will, capacity, \\nfinancial resources and treaty body reforms. To that \\nend, Dutch human rights policy stresses the importance \\nof forging trilateral partnerships in different regions \\nof the world. We focus on protecting human rights \\ndefenders and promoting LGBT and women’s rights.\\n\\nWithout development, there can be no global \\npeace and security. We are fast approaching 2015, \\nand have made great progress. In the next two years \\nwe can still make a difference and advance towards \\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The post-2015 \\ndevelopment agenda will also benefit from a single, \\nunified framework. We cannot talk about the plight \\nof the world’s poorest people in isolation from the \\nenvironmental problems endangering life on our planet. \\nIt is crucial to ensure that development is sustainable so \\nthat we can balance and integrate its economic, social \\nand ecological dimensions. Peace, security and the rule \\nof law constitute a fourth vital element of sustainable \\ndevelopment.\\n\\nThe key words for the post-2015 development \\nagenda are better aid, more trade and stronger policy \\ncoherence for sustainable development. Also, we \\nneed to promote women’s rights. That includes sexual \\nand reproductive health and rights, as well as equal \\nopportunity. I have four children — two of them are \\ngirls. It would be unbearable for me, as a parent, if they \\ndid not have equal opportunity as their brothers.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nIt goes without saying that a nation that was built \\nby claiming its lands from the sea is concerned when \\nrising sea levels might endanger that claim. Therefore, \\nwe feel a strong solidarity with other countries that are \\nthreatened in the same way. The Netherlands wants to \\nstrengthen the synergy between climate and poverty-\\nreduction policies, particularly in the field of water and \\nfood security.\\n\\nExactly 75 years ago today, British Prime Minister \\nChamberlain said, in a radio address on the Sudetenland \\ncrisis,\\n\\n“How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we \\nshould be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks \\nhere because of a quarrel in a far away country \\nbetween people of whom we know nothing.”\\nCzechoslovakia was dismembered shortly afterwards. \\nThat was not just the fault of the signatories of \\nthe Munich Agreement. The entire international \\ncommunity — especially Czechoslovakia’s fellow \\ndemocracies in Europe, including my own country, the \\nNetherlands — looked the other way.\\nToday we can no longer pretend to know nothing of \\nquarrels in faraway countries or of the people who live \\nthere. If we fail, it is not because of the deficiency of the \\nlegal instruments that we have developed. It is because \\nof the international community’s deficient sense of \\nresponsibility. It is our duty to take responsibility in \\naddressing the crisis in Syria.\\n\\nThe Secretary-General talked earlier this week \\nabout leadership and identified Nelson Mandela as a \\nshining example. I wish we would all listen to “Madiba” \\nmore often. On Syria, we should follow the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s lead and make peace and justice a reality.\\n\\nInvesting in the United Nations is an investment \\nin our common future. We are shareholders with a \\nlong-term interest. We need to have the instruments for \\npeace, justice and development ready for the moment \\nthat they can help avert catastrophe. That is why we \\ninvested in the Organization for the Prohibition of \\nChemical Weapons, which has now proved crucial in \\nthe Syrian crisis. That is why we should invest in the \\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council. \\nThat is why we should work as hard as we can to come \\nup with a clear and ambitious post-2015 sustainable \\ndevelopment agenda. We are all in this together; we \\nshould invest together in our United Nations.\\n\\n', 'The world in \\nwhich we live is profoundly changing, but whether it \\nchanges for the better is another matter. That is up to \\nus. We often get the impression that great strides are \\nbeing taken towards a better, more peaceful future. \\nUnfortunately, reality imposes disappointing setbacks \\nupon us. \\n\\nI recall an important step taken 150 years ago. \\nIn 1863, the International Committee of the Red \\nCross (ICRC) was founded in Geneva, giving rise to \\na global movement. Thanks to their humanitarian \\nspirit, representatives of that organization work to \\nprovide humanitarian help worldwide for people \\naffected by armed conflict and other violent situations. \\nThe humanitarian work of the ICRC is based on the \\nprinciples of neutrality, impartiality and independence. \\nAll victims of conflicts receive the same treatment, and \\nhelp is granted to all vulnerable persons. All human \\nbeings are valued equally. \\n\\nAlongside the humanitarian tradition shared by \\nSwitzerland and the ICRC, my country is proud of \\nanother tradition dating back centuries — neutrality. \\nI would recall that for centuries Switzerland’s foreign \\npolicy has been anchored in peaceful coexistence \\namong States. Thanks to our neutrality, we maintain \\nrelations with all countries. We never take sides, but \\nwe can provide support or propose our mediation. \\nFurthermore, our neutrality allows us to offer our good \\noffices. \\n\\nHumanitarian engagement is part of our history. It \\nis an honour for us to make our neutral soil available \\nfor peace talks, and we will continue to do all we can \\nto contribute towards peace in the world, in particular \\nthrough our good offices. That impartial work is based \\non our belief that there are differences between people \\nand between nations. Those differences are natural. \\nMoreover, all human beings enjoy equal rights. \\n\\nThe protection of human rights is a key element of \\nthe Swiss commitment. Those rights are an expression \\nof the obligations set out under international law and \\nmust be protected. Switzerland is concerned by the \\nwidespread excesses of violence and numerous human \\nrights violations. It calls on all States and civilian actors \\nto renounce violence. \\n\\nIn the Middle East, violent conflicts are imposing \\nunacceptable suffering on the civil population. The \\nsituation in Syria has deteriorated to such an extent that \\n\\n\\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of \\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original \\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \\nU.506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nhumanitarian organizations are unable to cope. Serious \\nand systematic violations and abuses of international \\nhumanitarian law and human rights cannot be tolerated \\nin any circumstances. Such crimes must not go \\nunpunished, regardless of which side is responsible. \\nThat is why my country, together with 57 like-minded \\nStates, called on the Security Council in January to \\nrefer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal \\nCourt. The use of chemical weapons is a particularly \\ndespicable crime. It is imperative to shed light on all \\nfacts. With that in mind, Switzerland welcomes recent \\ndevelopments. \\n\\nI stress the need for the international community to \\nspare no effort to pave the way for another conference \\nat the earliest possible date in Geneva. That conference \\nshould result in a negotiated and lasting solution that \\nwould take into account the legitimate aspirations of \\nall Syrians.\\n\\nSwitzerland is not the only country bound by the \\nprinciple of equal rights. The Charter of the United \\nNations endows it with universal validity. The preamble \\nreaffirms “faith in fundamental human rights, in the \\ndignity and worth of the human person, in the equal \\nrights of men and women”. \\n\\nWhat applies to all human beings also applies to \\nthe States we live in. That is why, in the same sentence, \\nafter referring to the fundamental rights of all people, \\nthe Charter refers explicitly to the equal rights of \\nnations “large and small”. Under paragraph 2 of Article \\nI of the Charter, the United Nations seeks “to develop \\nfriendly relations among nations based on respect for \\nthe principle of equal rights and self-determination of \\npeoples”. Paragraph 1 of Article 2 states that \\n\\n“[t]he Organization is based on the principle of the \\nsovereign equality of all its Members.”\\nI firmly believe that those principles are the keystone for \\nthe peaceful coexistence of all people and populations \\nof this world.\\nBut are we still sufficiently aware of this? Or are \\nwe prone to lose ourselves in grandiose ideas and minor \\ndetails? I have the impression that in international \\npolitics too much is said of how things should be in an \\nideal world and too little about reality. I cannot help \\nbut feel that excessive bureaucracy creates a kind of \\nparallel universe that leads to increased isolation. At \\nthe end of the day, that leads to increasingly higher \\ncosts and fewer concrete results.\\n\\nGlobal problems need more than general discussions; \\nabove all, they require a search for solutions shared by \\nall parties. The United Nations was created to find such \\nsolutions, and to that end it must be efficient, innovative \\nand effective. Only thus will it be able to make progress \\nin ensuring the equal rights of people and nations. \\nSwitzerland is firmly committed to contributing to that \\ntask. At present, certain developments are at odds with \\nthe shared values laid down in the Charter. I would like \\nto address those subjects and launch a discussion on \\nthese worrisome developments.\\n\\nAs the representative of a neutral State with a \\nlong-standing humanitarian tradition, it is with some \\nconcern that I observe the growing resurgence of \\npower politics. I note that large States are once again \\nchoosing to exercise their power and force and that they \\nview smaller States less and less as equal partners. I \\nsincerely hope that this trend will be reversed as soon \\nas possible. Otherwise, the fundamental values of the \\nCharter, which unite the international community and \\nto which its members feel committed, will be placed in \\ndoubt. \\n\\nAs I have already said, the tendency towards \\npower politics on the international stage worries me, \\nfor we believe that the countries on this planet should \\nbe free to choose their own futures, even as they \\nrespect others States and accept the rules of peaceful \\ncoexistence among peoples, without sacrificing their \\nspecific character. We believe in peaceful competition \\namong economies. We believe in the diversity of the \\nworld — the peaceful diversity of sovereign States \\nthat treat one another fairly and as equal partners. \\nPeople are free to draw up their own constitutions and \\nto determine their own economic order and their own \\nsystem of law. No State may impose its law over that \\nof another country. Problems are not solved by diktat, \\nbut through negotiations. The shared norms and rules \\nof international law exist to ensure that it is not simply \\nthe law of the strongest that applies. The principles of \\nsovereignty and equal rights provide peace and stability \\nand foster friendly relations between all peoples.\\n\\nThose are the convictions upon which the Charter \\nof the United Nations is based. Do we still share these \\nconvictions today? \\n\\nThe way in which large nations have acted in \\ndealings with small nations recently has disturbed me \\nbecause I often have the impression that force has often \\nbeen placed above the law. The United Nations is active \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nin a vast range of areas. There is perhaps a risk that it \\nhas taken on too much and lost sight of what is essential \\nand concrete. The United Nations and its Member States \\noften seem at a loss when the principles upon which \\nthe Organization were founded are at stake. Let us \\nnever forget what underlies these principles: the equal \\nrights of people and the equal rights and sovereignty \\nof nations. They are embodiments of the lessons of \\nhistory, which has been a painful story of oppression, \\nforeign domination and conflicts.\\n\\nTogether we must decide which path we want to \\ntake. Do we want to continue squandering our strength \\non issues of secondary interest? I believe that we should \\nstrive, here and now, to reaffirm and live out the values \\nof the United Nations. Let us commit ourselves to \\nachieving a peaceful world in which people and nations \\nenjoy equal rights and are of equal value — a world in \\nwhich right prevails over might. It is up to all of us here \\nin this Hall to do all in our power to achieve that goal. \\nLet us start without delay. \\n', 'Exactly \\n40 years ago, the two German States joined the United \\nNations. For Germans, that marked our full return to the \\ncommunity of nations. Germany supports the United \\nNations as the beating heart of a global order rooted \\nin cooperation, peaceful compromise and cooperative \\nsolutions.\\n\\nThe world has changed dramatically since then. \\nNew centres of economic and political power are \\nemerging. In recent years, Germany has established \\nnew strategic partnerships with the new global players \\nin Asia, Latin America and Africa.\\n\\nThe setting of our meeting today is different \\nfrom the usual one. The United Nations is undergoing \\nrenovation, which must not be restricted merely to the \\nbuildings. The United Nations must reflect the world \\nas it is, not as it used to be. Only then will it be fit for \\nthe challenges of our age. A Security Council without \\npermanent seats for Africa and Latin America does \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nnot reflect the realities of today’s world. A Council in \\nwhich the emerging and highly populous region of Asia \\nis represented by only one permanent seat does not \\nreflect the realities of today’s world. Nor does it reflect \\nthe reality of tomorrow. Germany, with its partners \\nJapan, India and Brazil, is prepared to assume greater \\nresponsibility. In essence, it is a matter of strengthening \\nthe United Nations. The authority of the United Nations \\ndepends on its being representative.\\n\\n\\nWe are seeking reform of the United Nations so that \\nits power to build consensus, establish global rules and \\nact effectively in response to crises and conflicts can \\nbe demonstrably strengthened. This is a call not only \\nto the United Nations itself, but also to each and every \\nindividual Member State. Only if we are prepared to \\ncompromise and are willing to act together will we \\nbe able to make the United Nations strong. Germany \\nremains committed to the United Nations. A strong \\nUnited Nations is in Germany’s interests.\\n\\nOur cultural differences and diverse traditions are \\nnot going to vanish in the age of globalization, but it \\nis not only the world’s markets that are becoming ever \\nmore closely interconnected: people’s expectations, \\nhopes and ideas are globalizing too. The developments \\nin the Arab world have shown us that a country’s \\nstability depends primarily not on the stability of \\nthe Government but on social stability. The best \\nguarantees for a society’s internal cohesion are respect \\nfor individual human rights, the triumph of the rule \\nof law over the arbitrary, and broad economic, social \\nand political participation on the part of the people. \\nGermany is committed to democratic change and to \\nrespect for human and civil rights, not because we want \\nto take the moral high ground but because we have \\nlearned from experience — from the painful experience \\nof our own history.\\n\\nIn Syria the people took to the streets to protest \\nagainst a repressive regime. For more than two years \\nnow, the regime’s response has been brutal violence, \\nwhich has brought countless deaths, immeasurable \\nsuffering and terrible destruction on the Syrian \\npeople and is now jeopardizing stability in the entire \\nregion. The use of chemical weapons, ascertained by \\nthe United Nations, is a crime against civilization. Its \\nterrible dimensions have consequences that extend far \\nbeyond Syria. All the facts available to us show that the \\nregime is responsible for the use of chemical weapons.\\n\\nThe use of chemical weapons cannot be allowed to \\ngo unpunished. That we owe not only to the victims in \\nSyria, but also to future generations. Those responsible \\nfor using such weapons must be called to account \\nbefore the International Criminal Court, which must at \\nlast be able to begin its independent investigations. We \\nwelcome the agreement reached in the Security Council \\nyesterday. The chemical weapons in Syria must be \\ncompletely destroyed in accordance with a firmly \\nagreed timetable. Germany is prepared to provide \\nfinancial and technical help to destroy those chemical \\nweapons. A world without weapons of mass destruction \\nwould be a better world.\\n\\nWe must take advantage of the opportunity for a \\npolitical process offered by the agreement on destroying \\nthe chemical weapons. After all, people in Syria are \\nstill being killed every day by conventional weapons. \\nBut there will be no military solution in Syria. Only a \\npolitical solution can bring lasting peace to Syria. That \\nwould include an immediate ceasefire. I am pleased \\nthat there is at last a timetable for a possible peace \\nconference, details of which still have to be clarified \\neven after yesterday’s decision in the Security Council. \\nOnly with a substantive political process can we counter \\nthe destabilization of the entire region.\\n\\nTo date, Germany has made available more than \\n€420 million to ease the worst of the suffering of the \\nSyrian people. But despite all of the outside help, \\nmillions of Syrians are fleeing. Ever more people are \\nat acute risk of starvation, and very soon they will also \\nbe at the mercy of the cold weather. They do not have \\neven the most basic medical care. We must seize every \\nopportunity to provide humanitarian access to the \\nsuffering population as quickly as possible. Amid all \\nthe devastation and hatred, the United Nations and its \\nstaff are the face of compassion and, for many Syrians, \\nthe only hope. I would like expressly to pay tribute to \\ntheir work and commitment.\\n\\nThe tragedy in Syria underlines the extraordinary \\nand growing importance attached to disarmament \\naimed at eliminating weapons of mass destruction and \\nthe strengthening of the non-proliferation regimes. \\nAttaining a world free of weapons of mass destruction is \\nour generation’s prime task for the future. Disarmament \\nis a crucial issue for the future of humankind.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nIran must allay the international community’s \\ndoubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of its \\nnuclear programme. We welcome Iran’s announcement \\nthis week that it is prepared to do so. The talks with the \\nIranian Government were encouraging. They open up \\na window of opportunity. Now it is imperative that we \\nrebuild trust. Germany is ready to conduct negotiations \\nin a constructive manner. However, the new words \\ncoming out of Tehran must be followed by deeds, and \\nnot at some unspecified time in the future, but right \\nnow. But, I repeat: a fresh start has been made.\\n\\nWe welcome the great commitment shown by \\nPresident Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry \\nin giving fresh impetus to the negotiations between \\nIsrael and the Palestinian leadership. Prime Minister \\nNetanyahu and President Abbas deserve our respect \\nfor their courage in embarking together on that course. \\nThey have our full support as they pursue that course \\ntowards a negotiated agreement. Only a negotiated two-\\nState solution can reconcile the legitimate interests of \\nthe two sides.\\n\\nThis week in New York has been an encouraging \\none for the world. I am gratified that it was not military \\nsolutions but the struggle for political and diplomatic \\nsolutions that came to the fore. The international \\ncommunity must continue to follow such an approach.\\n\\nBeyond crisis diplomacy, the United Nations is \\nthe central forum for setting binding objectives for \\nthe international community. Just a few days ago, the \\nGeneral Assembly agreed on the next steps for drawing \\nup a new post-2015 sustainable development agenda. \\nGermany wants to make a contribution in that regard \\nwith its experience of combining economic prosperity \\nand promoting political participation and sustainable \\nmanagement.\\n\\nSustainability and combating poverty are not only \\nkey social issues; they are also key foreign policy issues.\\n\\nIn formulating the future agenda, greater attention \\nneeds to be paid to human rights protection and good \\ngovernance than has been the case in the past. The \\nnew agenda must incorporate all three dimensions of \\nsustainability and take account of economic, social and \\nenvironmental aspects. With such a comprehensive \\napproach we can also strengthen the fragile statehood \\nin many countries and eradicate safe havens for \\nterrorists. Social stability is the best protection against \\nradicalization and extremism.\\n\\nGerman foreign policy is a policy for peace. It \\nfocuses on crisis prevention. We Germans accept our \\nresponsibility for international peacekeeping. We \\nfocus on personal and social development. We focus on \\nstrengthening civil society. We want to contribute to \\na global process in which we — in the North, South, \\nEast and West learn from each other and develop joint \\nsolutions by working together. Germany will continue \\nin future to use its economic clout and full political \\nstrength to promote peace and the balancing of interests.\\n\\nThe digital age brings with it entirely new \\nopportunities and challenges. We need an Internet in \\nwhich freedom, security and the protection of privacy \\nare appropriately reconciled. Just as we have to regulate \\ninternational financial flows in order to prevent global \\ncrises, so we need binding rules and standards for \\nglobal data flows. That is why Germany has submitted \\nto the Human Rights Council an initiative regarding \\nthe protection of the right to privacy in the digital \\nage. Everyone using the Internet should be able to be \\nsure that their rights are being respected worldwide \\nvis-à-vis private companies as well as vis-à-vis States. \\nNot everything that is technically possible must be \\nallowed to happen, nor is everything technically \\npossible legitimate.\\n\\nGermany remains firmly anchored in Europe. \\nEurope is a community of shared cultures, bound \\ntogether by a common destiny. Close union among \\nthe nations of Europe is and will remain the response \\nto our history and to our future in a world of change. \\nGerman foreign policy is firmly embedded in European \\nforeign policy. Europe will continue to use its clout, \\nits influence and its resources to uphold peace and \\njustice, to encourage development and cooperation \\nand to promote climate protection and disarmament \\nthroughout the world.\\n\\nThat is Germany’s twin obligation: a strong united \\nEurope in the world and a strong, effective United \\nNations for the world.\\n', 'I thank the President for \\nraising for discussion at this year’s general debate \\na very pertinent subject, namely, “The post-2015 \\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage”. Shaping our \\nplanet’s future after 2015 is indeed a crucial task ahead \\nof us, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described \\nvery impressively in his presentation this morning (see \\nA/68/PV.5). While we remain fully committed to the \\nfull implementation of the Millennium Development \\nGoals, the post-2015 agenda has started.\\n\\nOne idea that has caught my particular attention is \\nto upgrade the eradication of hunger from an indictor \\nto a goal in that new agenda. More still needs to be \\ndone, and everyone must contribute a fair share: States, \\ninternational organizations, the private sector, academia \\nand civil society alike. Let me assure the Assembly that \\nAustria will contribute its share as well.\\n\\nThe international community currently faces major \\nthreats in its search for global security. The Middle \\nEast remains exposed to fundamental challenges. We \\nwelcome the agreement reached between the United \\nStates and the Russian Federation on a framework for \\nthe destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. \\nWe believe that the Security Council should refer the \\nsituation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. \\nAccountability is, and remains, necessary to stopping \\nthe atrocities and prevent future crimes.\\n\\nThe path to democratic participation and a new \\nbeginning in Syria — the actual goal of the civilian \\nprotests that started two and a half years ago — remains \\ncrucial. Unfortunately, the parties seem to be firmly \\nset on a military solution to the conflict. However, it \\nshould be clear that the best way to achieve a sustainable \\nsolution can only be a political, negotiated one. That is \\nthe Austrian position.\\n\\nBy now the civil war in Syria is greatly affecting all \\nneighbouring countries. The conflict is a Syrian one, \\nbut the consequences go far beyond its borders. It has \\nindeed become international.\\n\\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to have \\nbeen overshadowed by the upheavals in the region. I \\nhave followed events there for almost 40 years. I am \\nconvinced that what is needed for a solution is the \\nwillingness not only to negotiate in good faith but also \\nto take into account the needs and sensibilities of the \\nnegotiating partner: the other side. I, for one, cannot \\nbelieve that the value of the new settlements to Israel \\noutweighs the damage they cause by being an obstacle \\nto peace and reasonable conditions.\\n\\nWe welcome that the new United States \\nAdministration has devoted its full attention to that \\nlong-standing question and that direct negotiations \\nresumed at the end of July. What we need now is decisive \\nleadership. We are convinced that a breakthrough in \\nthe central conflict would also mean a decisive step \\ntowards stabilization of the entire region.\\n\\nWhile we continue to support the ongoing transition \\nprocesses in the Arab world, recent developments \\nin the region have cast a shadow on the democratic \\ngains achieved so far. Progress on the difficult path to \\ndemocracy will greatly depend upon whether all parts \\nof society are included.\\n\\nVienna and its United Nations headquarters \\nserve as a platform for the discussion on sustainable \\ndevelopment. Austria is very pleased that the Office of \\nthe Special Representative for the Sustainable Energy \\nfor All initiative in Vienna started its activities on \\n1 July. We welcome the initiative’s cooperation with \\nthematic and regional hubs, as well as with other \\nspecialized organizations like the United Nations \\nIndustrial Development Organization.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nAustria is also the host country of the newly \\nestablished International Anti-Corruption Academy. \\nThis international organization and centre of excellence \\nhas already undertaken several successful activities in \\nfighting corruption — a major obstacle to reasonable \\ndevelopment in all areas of society. I thank the Kingdom \\nof Thailand for hosting the second Assembly of Parties, \\nscheduled to take place in December. Furthermore, I \\nwould like to invite all States that have not yet done so \\nto become members of the Anti-Corruption Academy.\\n\\nThis year’s Forum of the United Nations Alliance \\nof Civilizations took place in Vienna in February, with \\nthe forward-looking theme of “Responsible leadership \\nin diversity and dialogue”. More than 1,500 participants \\nfrom Government, civil society, the private sector and \\nthe media, as well as a youth forum of 150 outstanding \\nand highly dedicated participants, provided most \\nvaluable input for the discussions of the Forum.\\n\\nIn that context, I am also pleased to report that the \\nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre \\nfor Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue was \\ninaugurated in Vienna on 26 November 2012. The \\nCentre — a joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi \\nArabia, the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of \\nAustria — serves as an interactive platform for religious \\nleaders, experts and civil society alike.\\n\\nMultilateral cooperation can deliver solutions \\nto global problems. The historic accomplishment of \\nthe Arms Trade Treaty is an important example in \\nthat regard. We look forward to its earliest possible \\nentry into force. At the same time, the international \\ndisarmament and non-proliferation regime is being \\nchallenged, day after day, by alarming developments. \\nWe were, and still are, deeply shocked by the use of \\nchemical weapons in Syria. We observe North Korea’s \\ncontinued development of nuclear weapons and missile \\ncapabilities with concern. And we have new hope \\nthat the Iranian nuclear issue will be resolved by \\nnegotiations, which, after the election of a new Iranian \\nPresident, should be resumed shortly.\\n\\nSimilarly, the continued reliance on nuclear weapons \\nand the limited progress towards nuclear disarmament \\nare of great global concern. Nuclear disarmament and \\nnon-proliferation efforts can be achieved only when \\nthey go forward together. Nuclear weapons should be \\nstigmatized, banned and eliminated. The humanitarian \\nconsequences of nuclear weapons have to be put at the \\ncentre of our attention.\\n\\nWhile some might believe that there is a \\ncontradiction between respect for cultural and religious \\ndifferences on the one hand and the universality of \\nhuman rights on the other, I am convinced that they \\nreinforce each other. If people and nations can count on \\nhuman rights being protected, they will show respect \\nfor the other side.\\n\\nThe Human Rights Council, with its universal \\nperiodic review mechanism and special procedures, \\nhas, within a few years, developed into an effective \\ninstrument to address human rights violations and \\ncrisis situations in many instances. Austria, as a current \\nmember of the Council, is contributing to those efforts \\nwith targeted initiatives for the safety of journalists, the \\nprotection of religious minorities and the promotion of \\nthe rights of the child. \\n\\nWe welcome the continuing trend towards the \\nuniversal abolition of the death penalty, which is a \\nlongstanding interest of mine. However, too many \\ncountries still maintain a retentionist policy with regard \\nto that cruel and inhuman form of punishment. Our \\ndiplomatic efforts therefore have to be reinforced.\\n\\nWe are worried by the increasing number of \\nhuman rights violations based on sexual orientation or \\ngender identity. The 1993 World Conference on Human \\nRights in Vienna and the 2005 World Summit firmly \\nplaced human rights at the centre of United Nations \\nactivities. Respect for human rights is an indispensable \\nprerequisite for peace, security and development.\\n\\nLast year, the High-level Meeting of the General \\nAssembly on the Rule of Law provided an excellent \\nopportunity for us to renew our commitment to the \\nrule of law at the national and international levels. \\nThe Austrian Government is considering setting up an \\nAustrian rule-of-law trust fund, designed to support \\ninternational actors in strengthening the rule of law \\nand to offer legal expertise and deploy legal experts \\nfree of charge to developing countries, at their request. \\nInternational law and the rule of law are the foundations \\nof the international system. Austria strongly believes \\nthat only an international system based on the rule \\nof law can lead to lasting peace, security, economic \\ndevelopment and social progress. Obviously, that is \\nparticularly true for the use of force, which should \\noccur only in self-defence or when authorized by the \\nSecurity Council.\\n\\nIn that spirit, let me confirm that Austria remains \\nfully committed to an effective United Nations system. \\n\\nIn that connection, I especially want to thank Secretary-\\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts and his \\ncommitment to peace, the rule of law and human rights.\\n', 'The President of the General Assembly has chosen for \\nthis session and this general debate the theme “The post-\\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. He has \\nthus called on the Assembly to be bold and ambitious, \\nto work together towards the same objective, to prove to \\nthe world that we will not accept defeat, and to exert our \\ncollective responsibility in order to eradicate poverty \\nand promote sustainable development.\\n\\nLuxembourg stands ready to do so. We are ready \\nto work towards a renewed global partnership based \\non a common understanding of our shared humanity, \\non a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual \\naccountability, and on coordinated action that embraces \\nsecurity, development, governance, human rights and \\nthe rule of law.\\n\\nTo live free from fear, conflict and violence \\nis the most fundamental human right, and yet we \\nwitness unspeakable violations of human rights and \\ninternational humanitarian law every single day. The \\nuse of missiles, bombs, cluster munitions and chemical \\nweapons, the systematic imposition of sieges, forced \\ndisplacements, torture, sexual violence, violations \\nand abuses committed against children, more than \\n2 million refugees, more than 100,000 dead — these \\nare the chilling results of two and a half years of brutal \\nrepression and conflict in Syria. The list of war crimes \\nand crimes against humanity committed on a daily \\nbasis continues to grow. \\n\\nAgainst such horror, I repeat once again that the \\nsituation in Syria must be referred to the International \\nCriminal Court. Allow me to quote High Commissioner \\nfor Refugees António Guterres: \\n\\n“Syria has become the great tragedy of this \\ncentury — a disgraceful humanitarian calamity \\nwith suffering and displacement unparalleled in \\nrecent history”. \\nThe Syrian people need assistance now, and they \\nhave the right to such assistance under the most basic \\ncriteria codified in international humanitarian law. The \\nSyrian authorities must urgently meet the demands of \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nhumanitarian actors by immediately facilitating their \\nfree and unimpeded access to the affected populations. \\nIt is urgent to remove bureaucratic obstacles, to \\nensure the delivery of medical supplies, to institute \\nhumanitarian pauses, to open up humanitarian routes \\nand to allow access to populations in need across \\nborders and across conflict lines.\\n\\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security \\nCouncil, Luxembourg is working with Australia to \\namplify the demands of humanitarian actors to the \\nparties to the conflict in Syria and to secure them in a \\nunified message from the Security Council. I hope that \\nthose efforts will come to fruition very soon.\\n\\nWhile we have been able to make progress in \\npast few days on the issue of chemical weapons, and I \\nhope we will adopt, a few hours from now a Security \\nCouncil resolution establishing a strong and binding \\nmechanism to ensure the control and destruction of \\nthe Syrian chemical weapons as soon as possible. Yet \\nwe cannot and must not forget the humanitarian crisis \\nthat continues to unfold in Syria and its neighbouring \\ncountries, particularly Lebanon and Jordan but also in \\nIraq and Turkey. For its part, Luxembourg has fulfiled \\nthe pledges it made in Kuwait City on 30 January last, \\nand we have just decided to increase our humanitarian \\naid to the populations affected by the Syrian crisis to \\n€7.6 million.\\n\\nThe vigorous appeal made on Tuesday by the \\nSecretary-General should resonate with all of us. Let us \\nbreak our deafening silence and live up to our collective \\nand individual responsibilities. We all agree that a \\nlasting solution to the conflict in Syria can only be \\npolitical. Here too, let us live up to our responsibilities; \\nlet us seize the momentum created by the agreement \\non chemical weapons, set a date for the “Geneva II” \\nconference, and encourage the parties to participate \\ntherein in order to start down a road, on the basis of \\nthe Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/523, \\nannex), leading to a cessation of hostilities and to a \\nnecessary political transition in Syria that meets the \\nlegitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.\\n\\nTragic as it may be, the situation in Syria must not \\nlead us to forget the plight of the Palestinian people. \\nWe must not forget the urgent need to see the creation \\nof a contiguous and viable Palestinian State, living \\nin peace and security, side by side with the State of \\nIsrael. I welcome the commitment and resolve of the \\nSecretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, \\nto restart direct negotiations between the Israelis and \\nPalestinians. I also praise the political courage and \\nthe sense of responsibility shown by the Israeli and \\nPalestinian authorities in accepting to return to the \\nnegotiating table. Eight rounds have been held since \\n14 August. We hope that the negotiations will intensify \\nin October and lead to a result within the agreed time \\nframe of nine months.\\n\\nWe all know that this initiative is probably our last \\nopportunity to act. We must not let it slip away. If we do, \\nit could lead to dramatic consequences. The time has \\ncome to make difficult decisions, to take the necessary \\nhistoric measures in line with the long-term interests of \\nthe Israeli and Palestinian peoples. The time has come \\nto implement the two-State solution. This is no time \\nfor unilateral acts that fuel the dynamic of mistrust. \\nBuilding illegal settlements and destroying Palestinian \\nhomes and infrastructure in the West Bank, including \\nin East Jerusalem, must stop immediately. The attacks \\non Gaza must stop. All violence must stop.\\n\\nWith its partners in the European Union, \\nLuxembourg stands ready to pursue its active \\ncontribution to the ongoing efforts, in close cooperation \\nwith key stakeholders, the Quartet and countries in the \\nregion. There can be no security in Israel without a \\nviable Palestinian State. There can be no security in \\nthe region without peace in all countries of the Middle \\nEast.\\n\\nWe must shake up the status quo. We must break \\nthe cycle of violence. This imperative also applies to \\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great \\nLakes region. We dearly hope that the Peace, Security \\nand Cooperation Framework for the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo and the Region, signed on \\n24 February in Addis Ababa, represents a turning point \\nfor consolidating peace and regional stability. The \\nsecond meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism, \\nheld at the level of the Heads of State and Government \\non Monday in New York City, led to the adoption of \\nregional benchmarks and indicators on progress, which \\nwill facilitate the implementation of the Framework. \\n\\nThis is an important first step. It must be \\nfollowed by concrete action at the political, security \\nand economic levels. The parties must fulfil all their \\ncommitments diligently and in good faith, including a \\ncommitment neither to tolerate nor to provide assistance \\nor support of any kind to armed groups, in particular \\nthe Mouvement du 23 mars, which continues to operate \\nin the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. We \\nmust tackle the root causes of recurring violence and \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nlay the foundation for reviving the regional economy \\nin order to initiate a virtuous circle that will allow the \\npeople of the region to start down the the path towards \\nsustainable development.\\n\\nThe commitment of the international community is \\nall the more necessary in a situation that, regrettably, \\nhas received far less attention. I am referring to \\nthe humanitarian tragedy unfolding in the Central \\nAfrican Republic, affecting the entire population of \\n4.6 million people. Law and order and the rule of law \\nhave collapsed. Human rights violations have become \\ncommonplace, as have arbitrary arrests and detention, \\ntorture, sexual violence against women and children, \\nrape and extrajudicial executions. According to our \\nsources, Séléka militias have also recruited and used \\nat least 3,500 child soldiers. No one can be indifferent \\nto those figures. The humanitarian situation continues \\nto deteriorate. The prevailing insecurity has further \\nreduced access to the affected populations. We must act \\nimmediately.\\n\\nRestoring security and law and order must be our \\nfirst priority. We strongly welcome the decision of the \\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council to authorize \\nthe deployment of an international support mission \\nto the Central African Republic. The United Nations \\nshould give its full logistical and financial support to \\nthis African-led mission. Our credibility is at stake.\\n\\nWe all know the disastrous effects of the unregulated \\ntrade in conventional arms — violent repression, armed \\nconflict, crime and widespread violence. That is why \\nthe Arms Trade Treaty is so important. The General \\nAssembly adopted the Treaty by a very large margin \\nfive months ago. Luxembourg is proud to have been \\namong the first sponsors of that important initiative. \\nWe are proud to have signed the Treaty as soon as it was \\nready for signature on 3 June. The national ratification \\nprocedure has started, and members can count on our \\nsupport to ensure that the Treaty comes rapidly into \\nfull force. In that regard, allow me to congratulate the \\nhomeland of the President of the General Assembly, \\nAntigua and Barbuda, on having ratified the Treaty. \\nI also welcome the fact that more than 110 States \\nMembers of the United Nations, including the United \\nStates of America, have already signed this new legal \\ninstrument. \\n\\nThe Arms Trade Treaty is a significant step forward \\nfor international law, international humanitarian law \\nand human rights. In that context, I welcome yesterday’s \\nimportant Security Council debate on the impact of the \\nillicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse \\nof small arms and light weapons on international peace \\nand security (see S/PV.7036), as well as its adoption of \\nresolution 2117 (2013). The Council has thereby rightly \\nunderscored the need for an integrated response from \\nthe international community that takes into account the \\nnegative effects of those illicit activities on security, \\ngovernance, the rule of law and development, as well \\nas the links between such activities and other threats \\nto international peace and security such as terrorism, \\npiracy and transnational organized crime.\\n\\nThe recent callous attack on a shopping centre \\nin Nairobi has again demonstrated the importance of \\nour ongoing vigilance in the fight against terrorism. \\nThis unacceptable act must encourage us to further \\nsupport African efforts aimed at freeing Somalia from \\nthe threat of Al-Shabaab. During the New Deal for \\nSomalia conference held on 16 September in Brussels, \\nI had the opportunity to reaffirm that Luxembourg \\nremained committed to working alongside Somalia. \\nWe are convinced that with the determined support of \\nthe international community — the African Union and \\nthe United Nations in particular, the Government and \\npeople of Somalia will be able to continue their journey \\ntowards peace, security and prosperity.\\n\\nThe risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass \\ndestruction remains just as real a threat as the threat of \\nterrorism. Yesterday, negotiations between the Islamic \\nRepublic of Iran and the E3+3 Governments, led by \\nthe European Union’s High Representative for Foreign \\nAffairs and Security Policy, Ms. Ashton, resumed here \\nin New York. We support those efforts. We seek solid \\nnegotiations quickly leading to concrete outcomes and \\na diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis. \\n\\nSanctions are not in and of themselves an end. \\nThey are a global response to Iran’s refusal to meet its \\ninternational obligations and to cooperate fully with the \\nInternational Atomatic Energy Agency. We encourage \\nthe new Iranian leadership to engage in constructive \\ndialogue, to take the measures necessary to prove to the \\ninternational community that its nuclear programme is \\nintended for exclusively peaceful purposes, and to turn \\na new leaf in its relations with the global community. \\nI hope that the recent phone call between President \\nObama and President Rouhani will help move the \\nsituation in that direction. \\n\\nWhen we talk about sustainable development and \\nthe creation of the post-2015 development agenda, we \\ncannot ignore the devastating effects of conflicts and \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nviolence on development. The crisis situations and \\nthreats that I have just mentioned illustrate this clearly. \\nWe must also speak firmly about governance that is \\nconducive to development, institutions that guarantee \\nthe rule of law, freedom of expression, and transparent \\nand accountable Governments. We must talk about \\njustice, the fight against impunity and respect for \\ninternational law.\\n\\nLuxembourg fully subscribes to the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s call for the post-2015 objectives to be based \\non the international norms and principles of human \\nrights. Those objectives must apply to everybody and \\nhelp address the global challenges of the twenty-first \\ncentury, building on the Millennium Development \\nGoals (MDGs). They must contribute to eliminating \\npoverty and promoting sustainable development, and \\nbe integrated into one coherent framework. \\n\\nThe special event held the day before yesterday \\nby the General Assembly allowed us to take stock of \\nongoing work towards achieving the MDGs and to \\nwelcome significant progress made, but also to identify \\nthe sectors where it will be important to redouble our \\nefforts. As the Secretary-General has reminded us, \\nthe picture before us is only half finished. We must \\ntherefore speed up the march towards attaining the \\nMDGs. We must renew our commitment. We must keep \\nour promises.\\n\\nMy country will continue to do its part. Since 2009, \\nour official development assistance has amounted \\nto 1 per cent of our gross national income. We are \\ndetermined to maintain this effort despite the crisis. \\n\\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \\nDevelopment in June 2012, we reaffirmed our \\ncommitment to sustainable development in its three \\ninterdependent dimensions: economic development, \\nsocial inclusion and environmental sustainability. We \\nreiterated our determination to address the threats that \\nclimate change and environmental degradation pose to \\nhumankind. With its European partners, Luxembourg \\nhas made binding commitments to reduce its carbon \\nemissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change. \\nWe are resolved to do our all to achieve a universal \\nclimate agreement in 2015.\\n\\nLast year in the Hall of the General Assembly, \\nour Head of State, the Grand Duke, underscored \\nLuxembourg’s willingness to serve the United Nations \\n(see A/67/PV.9). Today, I take this opportunity to thank \\nthe Assembly for having elected my country to a two-\\nyear term on the Security Council. That tenure, the first \\nin our history, is not only an honour but a responsibility \\nthat we do not take lightly. Each day since 1 January, \\nLuxembourg has worked in concert with its partners \\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace \\nand security and to assume our common responsibility \\nto prevent, to preserve and to protect. No task is more \\nnoble. No task is more urgent in the current context.\\n\\n', 'It was \\nin my country, in Ypres, during the First World War, \\nthat chemical weapons were used in a conflict for the \\nfirst time. We can all recall the dreadful suffering of \\nthousands of those soldiers. Almost 100 years later, \\nthat same suffering is being inflicted on thousands of \\nSyrians. Despite the international Geneva Protocol of \\n1925, the history of the world — a shared history — is \\nrepeated, from Ypres to Damascus.\\n\\nThis is the second year that I have addressed the \\nGeneral Assembly from this rostrum. In one year, so \\nmany hopes have been raised and fulfilled but, at the \\nsame time, so many additional war crimes have been \\ncommitted. A year ago, I spoke of 30,000 Syrian \\ndeaths. Today there are 120,000. And that conflict is \\nnot the only one. While we are talking here, atrocities \\ncontinue in various parts of the world.\\n\\nAll of us here must show as much courage as the \\nmen and women who are fighting in the streets for their \\nfreedom and dignity. Within the United Nations, we \\nhave everything we need to act, while those who are \\nfighting often have nothing but their courage to live on. \\nIf a veto must be cast, it should be a veto on tyrants and \\ntheir crimes.\\n\\nNo one can end a famine or stop a tyrant alone.\\nPeace is a shared responsibility. That is why there is \\nno alternative to multilateralism and politics, if we \\nseek to improve the lot of humankind. That is what \\nmotivates Belgium’s commitment, which is political, \\nfinancial and at times even military, as the fifteenth \\nmost significant contributor to the United Nations.\\n\\nMy country is also of the view that among \\nour responsibilities we have the responsibility to \\nprotect — that is to say, the responsibility to prevent and \\nfight the particularly atrocious crimes of genocide, war \\ncrimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. \\nBelgium fully supports the actions of the United \\nNations in that regard. In 2014, we will organize an \\ninternational conference in Brussels on the prevention \\nof genocide.\\n\\nWhen we work together, we achieve results. Mali is \\nproof of that. But let us not forget that nothing is ever \\n\\nsettled forever. For it to last, peace must be continuously \\nnourished. I would like to commend in particular the \\nrecent efforts of the international community in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The population \\nof the north-east of the country has for years suffered \\nmassacres, mass rapes, the forced recruitment of \\nsoldiers, including of child soldiers, pillage and forced \\ndisplacement. Just yesterday, witnesses told me of \\nmartyred children. That is shameful.\\n\\nThe efforts of the Secretary-General and the \\nSecurity Council to strengthen the mandate of the \\nUnited Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo are bearing \\nfruit. The Intervention Brigade is playing an active \\nrole in protecting the population. The Addis Ababa \\nFramework offers a genuine possibility for the \\nstabilization of the entire region. However, let us make \\nno mistake: agreement at Kampala is essential for the \\nprocess to be successful. Pragmatic solutions must \\nalso be found — without, however, accepting general \\namnesty or allowing for impunity for war crimes and \\ncrimes against humanity.\\n\\nBelgium stands ready to contribute to such solutions. \\nThe territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic \\nof the Congo must also be respected. All external \\ninterference must cease. Belgium urges the Congolese \\nauthorities to implement the structural reforms needed \\nin the army and the police, so as to re-establish the \\nrule of law throughout the national territory and to \\nguarantee the prosperity of the Congolese people.\\n\\nGoing to war, building walls and curtailing rights \\nis always easier than building bridges and keeping \\nthe peace. It is easier to build walls than to organize \\na democratic system or build hospitals and schools. \\nIn our contemporary globalized world, conflicts can \\nbe resolved only by political solutions. That is why \\nBelgium supports the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations \\nand the League of Arab States, as he seeks to bring \\nthe parties to the negotiating table. In that regard, I \\nwelcome the American-Russian initiative to hold the \\n“Geneva II” conference.\\n\\nIt is not death that metes out justice; it is respect \\nfor the law. It is the law that organizes human societies, \\nprotects the weak and prevents violence. Law is \\nessential because a world without rules — whether in \\nterms of civil interactions, trade or finance — leaves \\nhumankind face to face with its worst enemy: itself. \\nRespect for the law is a foundation of the life we share. \\nLaws must be respected, including in situations of \\nconflict. I am referring in particular to humanitarian \\nlaw, so that victims can receive assistance and care.\\n\\nBelgium has echoed and tirelessly backed the calls \\nfrom humanitarian agencies for the obstacles to their \\nactivities to be lifted. We demand that access to health \\ncare be improved on the ground everywhere, including \\nin Syria. All parties must respect international \\nhumanitarian law. My country participates actively \\nin efforts to provide assistance to populations that \\nhave been victims of fighting. The onset of winter \\nand the sharp rise in the number of victims, refugees \\nand displaced persons mean that the international \\ncommunity must step up its efforts further still.\\n\\nThe law must also stop impunity. Peace cannot ever \\nbe built on amnesty for the worst crimes, or turning a \\nblind eye thereto. Together with 56 other States, Belgium \\nhas called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the \\nInternational Criminal Court. The work of the Court is \\ncontributing to bringing about an era of responsibility. \\nAll States should cooperate with the Court.\\n\\nThe law must also make it possible to bring \\ndictatorships and oppression to an end. In 2010, all \\nthose who defend democracy welcomed the advent of \\nthe Arab Spring. I am not one of those who today have \\nturned their backs on that hope. Let us not forgot all \\nof the women and men in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and \\nelsewhere who wish to live in peace. We must support \\nthem and promote the holding of free elections. We \\nshould encourage them to draft constitutions that \\nguarantee fundamental rights, justice and equality. We \\nshould also recall that winning an election or exercising \\nauthority following elections does not give someone \\nthe right to oppress minorities. True democracy means \\nrespecting and protecting minorities.\\n\\nThe law must guarantee individual freedoms. \\nFreedom means, for example, the right of young women \\nto study and to choose their partners for themselves \\nor to remain single. Freedom also means the rights \\nof women to move in public as they please. Freedom \\nalso means to right to practice one’s religion or to \\npractice none at all. Freedom also means the right of \\nheterosexual and homosexual couples to walk hand in \\nhand in the street or in other public spaces. I am proud \\nthat Belgium guarantees those fundamental freedoms. \\nI am also proud that my country promotes efforts to \\nspread such freedoms everywhere in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nWhile I am speaking of continuing our efforts \\nand making them lasting, I would like to mention the \\nresumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. It is \\nabsolutely vital that we seize the opportunity afforded \\nby our American friends. A solution must be arrived at \\nnow, based on the coexistence of two States, with the \\nState of Israel and an independent State of Palestine \\nliving side by side in peace and security. We have also \\nmade it very clear that we are against colonization. \\nIn that context, Belgium is ready to host a conference \\nin Brussels aimed at ensuring that private economic \\npartners provide support for the peace process. We \\nbelieve that there can be no economic plan, however, \\nunless there is a political plan with a concrete timetable.\\n\\nPeace and security also depend on harmonious \\nprosperity, whose benefits must be shared equitably \\naround the globe and among its citizens. According to \\nscientists, the world’s ecological footprint now exceeds \\nthe world’s capacity for regeneration by about 50 per \\ncent. That situation is untenable and affects everything \\non the planet. \\n\\nI welcome the United Nations initiative to convene \\nHeads of State and Government here in New York for \\na forum on sustainable development. It is here that \\nless developed and developed countries can solve the \\nhuge challenge of sustainable development together. \\nEvery country has problems that are either shared or \\ncomplementary and interconnected. By that I mean \\nextreme poverty, desertification, the exodus for \\necological reasons of millions of people, the exhaustion \\nof natural resources and climatic warming.\\n\\nDespite the progress that has been made, \\nmuch remains to be done to meet the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. Hunger, poverty and unequal \\naccess to education and health care are intolerable \\ninjustices. We must continue to mobilize to fight them. \\nThat is why Belgium asks that the efforts made under \\nthe rubric of post-2015 development be merged with the \\ngoals of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \\nDevelopment in a single negotiation framework within \\nthe United Nations. That single framework should \\nbring together the economic, social and environmental \\naspects that are becoming facts of life for all of us.\\n\\nI would like to touch on one final subject, that is, \\nespionage and cybercrime. Our colleague President \\nDilma Rousseff asked a true question for today (see \\nA/68/PV.5). Is it permissible to ignore privacy laws in \\nthe name of security and the fight against terrorism, \\ntwo areas that are basic for all peoples? I support \\nthe call by the President of Brazil for protecting the \\nprivate lives of citizens everywhere, in particular \\non the Internet. She proposed the establishment of a \\nmultilateral framework designed to effectively ensure \\nthe protection of data online. The Internet must not \\nbecome an invisible battleground. It should remain an \\ninstrument of freedom and development for all, a place \\nwhere all can communicate in peace and security.\\n\\nIn 2014, along with other nations, Belgium will \\nsolemnly commemorate the centenary of the First \\nWorld War. We will do it out of duty to the memory \\nof the young men from more than 50 countries who \\ncame to die on the battlefields of my country in order \\nto liberate us. They were not even 20 years old. We will \\nalso commemorate the war’s centenary in order to teach \\nyoung people of today, so that they too can become \\nmilitants for peace.\\n', 'It is an \\nhonour for the United Nations to act everywhere where \\nthe freedom of peoples is denied. It is an honour for \\nthe United Nations to act where fundamental rights are \\ncompromised. It is an honour for the United Nations to \\nintervene where extremism threatens the security of the \\nworld. It is an honour for the United Nations to act on \\nbehalf of peace.\\n\\nIn Syria, the situation is becoming urgent because \\n120,000 people have died over the past two and a half \\nyears — 90,000 in the past year alone. One-fourth of \\nthe population is displaced. Millions of Syrians have \\nbecome refugees and the country has been destroyed. \\nThe worst happened on 21 August in Damascus, \\nwhen chemical weapons were used against civilians, \\nincluding women and children. United Nations \\ninspectors, sent officially on behalf of the Organization \\nhave, established unequivocally and with certainty the \\nuse of these weapons. \\n\\nIn the face of this horrifying crime, France sought a \\nstrong reaction to punish this violation of international \\nlaw and to dissuade Bashir Al-Assad’s regime from \\ncommitting new massacres. This pressure exerted by \\nmy country, along with others, in particular the United \\nStates, has seen some initial results. Negotiations are \\nunder way as we speak to ensure the verification and \\ndestruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. \\n\\nHowever, if these negotiations are to attain their \\nultimate end, I have set out three requirements. The \\nfirst is that any text must clearly make it possible for \\nthe Security Council to become seized of this issue of \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nchemical weapons at any given moment. The second \\nrequirement is that the draft resolution we are preparing \\nprovides for coercive measures under Chapter VII in \\nthe event that the Syrian regime fails to respect its \\ncommitments. Since the agreement signed between the \\nUnited States and Russia has the same provision, that is \\nall the more reason to include it in the draft resolution. \\nThe third requirement is that those who have committed \\nthese crimes must be held accountable before justice. \\n\\nBut we cannot limit ourselves to this draft \\nresolution, which must be adopted soon. We must \\nend this war, the deadliest since the beginning of the \\ncentury. The solution is political. Too much time has \\nbeen squandered, and I will not refer again to the \\nblocking of action in the Security Council. During this \\nperiod, not only has the regime increased its violence, \\nbut terrorist groups have also taken advantage of the \\ninternational community’s inertia, to the detriment of \\nthe democratic forces found within the Syrian National \\nCoalition. \\n\\nThis is why the “Geneva II” conference must be \\nheld as soon as possible. For France, however, Geneva \\nII is not just a talk shop. It must be a conference to \\ndefine the objective for putting in place a transitional \\nGovernment with full executive powers, mandated to \\nre-establish civil peace, to protect all communities and \\nto organize elections in due time. I am sometimes asked \\nabout participants in this conference. My response is \\nsimple. All countries — and I repeat, all countries — that \\naccept the goal of installing a transitional Government \\nand clearly acknowledge their commitment to a political \\nsolution will be welcome at the conference. \\n\\nOf equal urgency is the humanitarian situation. In \\nSyria, the displaced are in the millions, and there are \\nnow more than 1.5 million refugees in Turkey, Jordan \\nand Lebanon. The prolongation of the crisis poses \\na direct threat to the unity and security of Lebanon, \\nnearly 20 per cent of whose population is now of Syrian \\norigin. \\n\\nI would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \\nKi-moon for having organized the first meeting of the \\nInternational Support Group for Lebanon. France is \\ncommitted to that country because we know how much \\nit has suffered in recent years from disturbances in the \\nMiddle East and how much it needs to be supported \\ntoday in its efforts to host refugees.\\n\\nThere are serious concerns in that part of the \\nMiddle East, but there are also glimmers of hope. \\nThe first is the resumption of negotiations between \\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. Only that will enable \\npeace to be achieved. It requires the coexistence of \\ntwo States, both with safe and recognized borders. \\nWe must do everything to ensure that the opportunity \\nthat now exists for Israelis, Palestinians and the entire \\nregion is seized to finally bring an end to a conflict that \\nwhose regional and international repercussions are well \\nknown to us all. Negotiating peace between Israel and \\nPalestine would be an historic act.\\n\\nThe second glimmer of hope is found in the \\nstatements of the new Iranian President, which reflect \\nan evolution. I will not exaggerate them, but the question \\nnow is to know whether those words will be translated \\ninto actions, in particular concerning the nuclear \\nissue. For the past 10 years, our discussions have not \\nprogressed, leading the the international community \\nto adopt increasingly severe sanctions. The situation \\nis dangerous, as we all know. Therefore, France \\nexpects from Iran concrete gestures reflecting that \\ncountry’s renunciation its military nuclear programme, \\nalthough it clearly retains the right to pursue its civilian \\nprogramme. That is why I have chosen to engage in \\ndirect and open dialogue with President Rouhani. I will \\nalso say from this rostrum that while I am in favour of \\ndialogue, I remain firm on the serious issue of nuclear \\nproliferation.\\n\\nThe Middle East is not the only region of the \\nworld that is of concern to us. Africa has fallen prey to \\nterrorism, and the barbaric attack in Nairobi confirms \\nthat to us once again, tragically. Victories are possible \\nagainst terrorism. In Mali, with the clear mandate of \\nthe Security Council, African and French forces, with \\nthe support of Europe, intervened in response to the \\nappeal of the authorities in Bamako and brought an end \\nto a broad terrorist offensive. Today we see the results. \\nMali has regained its territorial integrity. It has ensured \\nthe security of its population, and it has even been able \\nto hold, on the scheduled date, a presidential election \\nthat has been recognized as incontestable. I welcome \\nthe new President of Mali, Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar .eita. \\nHis election is evidence of a great victory for West \\nAfrica against terrorism.\\n\\nHowever, the threat continues to weigh heavily on \\nthe Sahel and in Libya, where weapons are uniquitous \\nand where terrorist groups have found refuge. We must \\nassist the Libyan authorities to ensure the security \\nof their territory and of their population. France is \\nprepared to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nI would like to sound an alarm, as I did last year \\nwith respect to Mali. The warning here is about the \\nCentral African Republic — a small country that has \\nbeen ravaged by coups and conflicts for years. Today, \\nchaos has taken root and civilians are yet again its \\nvictims. We must bring an end to the abuse, which is \\nalso sectarian in nature. That is why I would like the \\nSecurity Council to issue a mandate and provide the \\nlogistical and financial means to create an African \\nforce, with its first mission to re-establish stability in \\nthe Central African Republic.\\n\\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, women \\nand children are victims of violence every day in the \\nKivu region. Again, it is essential that we continue \\nto strengthen the United Nations Organization \\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the \\nCongo, to implement the Addis Ababa agreement, and \\nto reject all external interference.\\n\\nWe must learn from the experience of recent years. \\nEverywhere chaos reigns, terrorism takes root and \\ngrows. That is the case in Somalia, and the horrific \\nattack against Kenya reminds us that Al-Shaabab-\\naffiliated groups, while they have been defeated, have \\nnot yet been eradicated. That is why the international \\ncommunity must help African States to protect \\nthemselves.\\n\\nFrance will convene, late this year, a meeting on \\npeace and security in Africa. France has invited all \\nAfrican countries; Europe will be represented, as will \\nthe United Nations. The purpose of the meeting is to \\nenable the establishment, training and equipping of \\nAfrican armies to ensure the security of the continent \\nand combat all traffickers, particularly drug traffickers, \\nand piracy. Africans themselves must ensure their \\nsecurity, but we cannot leave them to face the terrorist \\nthreat alone. \\n\\nThe best weapons we have are our development \\npolicies, because poverty, unemployment and inequality \\nprovide fertile soil for violence and insecurity. Again, \\nFrance calls for the mobilization of the international \\ncommunity through new funds that we must create to \\nfinance the necessary infrastructures and to enable \\naccess to essential public services.\\n\\nFrance is fighting, along with Europe, for the \\nintroduction of innovative financing. My country’s tax \\non airline tickets, which helps finance the International \\nDrug Purchase Facility (UNITAID), has brought in \\nmore than €1 billion since 2006. My country has decided \\nto increase that tax by a further 10 per cent to enhance \\nour fight against the great pandemics: HIV/AIDS, \\ntuberculosis and malaria. With Europe, France has \\nalso established a tax on financial transactions. I have \\ndecided to allocate 10 per cent of that income towards \\nsuch development-related actions as access to water \\nand renewable energy, because with development \\nassistance we can help the poorest countries to ensure \\ntheir future, and thereby their security, and to respond \\nto global warming, which concerns us all.\\n\\nFrance is available to host the 2015 climate \\nconference. This matter, too, respresents a threat to \\nour own security, because one report after another \\nstates that if we do nothing, by the end of this century \\nthe temperature of the planet will have increased by \\nthree or four degrees Centigrade, with the well-known \\nconsequences of flooding in some places, droughts in \\nothers. Those direct threats would in turn endanger \\npeace throughout the world. We must therefore seek an \\nagreement at the 2015 climate conference.\\n\\nThe foundations of the commitment are well known. \\nThe agreement must be equitable. Each country must do \\nits part. The developed countries obviously must make \\nhe greatest effort. Emerging countries must protect their \\ndevelopment, but they must also understand that they \\nare directly threatened by global warming. The least \\ndeveloped countries, those that are the most fragile and \\nvulnerable, must be aided in the transition. That is the \\npurpose of the fund that was created in Durbin. The \\nagreement must also be binding; it cannot simply be a \\nreiteration of principles. It cannot simply be wording in \\nresolutions that are not translated into concrete actions. \\nIf there is no assessment and there are no sanctions, \\nthere will be no progress and global temperature will \\ninexorably rise.\\n\\nMy message is simple. In any domain, whether \\ninternational security, nuclear proliferation, \\ndevelopment or climate change, the worst threat is \\ninaction, the worst decision is to take no decision, \\nand the worst danger is to not see any. And the United \\nNations bears the responsibility to act. Each time the \\nOrganization appears powerless, peace is the first \\nvictim. That is why I am proposing that the permanent \\nmembers of the Security Council define a code of \\nconduct such that in cases of mass crimes, they may \\ncollectively decide to renounce the right of veto.\\n\\nIt is also my hope to see the Secretary-General’s \\npowers of inquiry strengthened to enable the United \\nNations to ensure — as it has done in Syria — that \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthe truth is established in all instances, carry out \\ninvestigations and act on the results. The Assembly has \\nthe sovereign right to take such a decision. Our credibility \\ndepends upon our capacity to intervene quickly and \\neffectively in ensuring respect for international law, \\npunishing violations and promoting development to \\npreserve future generations. Our legitimacy flows \\nfrom the Charter of the United Nations. We must be \\nworthy of it. Within that framework, France will always \\nassume its responsibilities in all domains.\\n', '“A world in which people know how to solve \\ntheir problems in peace without violence; a world \\nof freedom and mutual respect; a world where all \\nyoung people can look forward to finding work that \\nallows them to live a happy life.”\\nThat, in his own words, is the world that a young man \\nfrom my country would like to see. His name is Damian \\nVogt. He is in this Hall and represents Switzerland’s \\nyouth at the United Nations. This week we work here \\ntogether to make that world a reality.\\nA little more than a year ago, another young person \\nstood in this very place and addressed the world. She \\nsaid:\\n\\n(spoke in English)\\n“I speak not for myself, but for all girls and \\nboys ... Those who have fought for their rights: \\ntheir right to live in peace; their right to be treated \\nwith dignity; their right to equality of opportunity; \\ntheir right to be educated.”\\n(spoke in French)\\nThe entire world still remembers the words of \\nMalala Yousafzai. The entire world still remembers \\nher courage. What a difference in the lives that Malala \\nand Damian have known. What a difference between \\ngoing to school only at the risk of your life and going \\nto school as a right — the right to a better life. And yet, \\nMalala and Damian, like millions of other young people \\naround the globe, want exactly the same thing: peace, \\nhuman dignity, freedom and equality, an education, and \\nan opportunity to work. The youth of today have a right \\nto expect from all of us, we who represent the nations, \\nthat we truly will be united in our commitment to do \\neverything within our power to place in their hands \\ntomorrow a world where humanity is synonymous with \\nsecurity, freedom and prosperity.\\n\\nIt is a century now since the outbreak of the First \\nWorld War, and 75 years since the beginning of the \\nSecond World War. The memory of those cataclysmic \\nevents imposes a duty on humankind to work towards \\ngreater security and freedom, to bring about the \\nconditions for prosperity, and to become an Organization \\nof genuinely united nations that is effective as a true \\nassembly of States at the service of the people. Here \\nat the heart of the United Nations, Switzerland wishes \\nto do its part by making the following twin objectives \\na priority: strengthening international security and \\nreforming the United Nations.\\n\\nThe security challenges are immense. At no time \\nsince the Second World War has humankind seen so \\nmany people displaced. More than 50 million men, \\nwomen and children have been torn from their homes. \\nThe story of each and every one of them is a human \\ntragedy. Caught up in this current of insecurity are \\nalso 75 million young people who, without work, face \\na future without prospects. We are talking about one \\nyoung person in 10 in the world, and in certain regions \\none in two. Worse still, in ever more regions throughout \\nthe globe there are waves of instability assailing the rule \\nof international law and, in particular the principles of \\nhumanitarian law, which are being ignored, violated, \\nand swept away in the deluge.\\n\\nThis is extremely worrisome in the Middle East, \\nabove all in Syria and Iraq. Switzerland condemns in \\nthe strongest terms the brutal acts of the self-proclaimed \\nIslamic State and the groups that have allied themselves \\nwith it. Islam can, and must, like other religions, be a \\nmessenger of peace, humanity and fraternity. As for the \\nnations, they can and must be truly united as a constant \\nreminder at all times and in all places of the supremacy \\nof law over force.\\n\\nWhere serious violations occur, investigations must \\nbe carried out. Here, the independent commissions of \\ninquiry play an essential role, especially that of the \\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry \\non the Syrian Arab Republic, to allow for genuine \\nreconciliation and lasting peace. Switzerland and 60 \\nother States have requested the Security Council to \\nrefer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal \\nCourt. We have also committed ourselves to an increase \\nin our humanitarian aid in the region. The crisis in \\nSyria must be dealt with as a whole, and we call on the \\nparties to return to the negotiating table and to work \\ntowards a political solution.\\n\\nSwitzerland calls on the Iraqi Government to \\nensure accountability. It joins the United Nations High \\nCommissioner for Human Rights in calling on Iraq to \\nconsider accession to the Rome Statute.\\n\\nWith regard to all forms of extremism that can \\nlead to acts of terrorism, it is important also to address \\ntheir root causes to show young people that violence \\nholds out no promise for the future. The establishment \\n\\n\\nin Geneva of the Global Community Engagement and \\nResilience Fund was an important step in this direction.\\n\\nThe world in 2014 has witnessed a conjunction of \\nmany crises — in the Middle East, in the Maghreb, in \\nAfrica, and also in Europe, where war returned this \\nyear with the crisis in Ukraine. This situation weakens \\nthe security of the entire continent.Violations of the \\nHelsinki principles and of international law, whether \\nin the form of an illegal annexation of territory, such \\nas that of Crimea by Russia, or of military incursions \\nin eastern Ukraine, demand a firm response from the \\ninternational community. But such a response must also \\nbe balanced, leaving room for dialogue and cooperation \\nso that open discussion remains possible. To simply \\nisolate Russia from the rest of Europe will not solve \\nany problems and will only create more, in Europe and \\nbeyond. Stability can be restored in Ukraine and in \\nEurope if we succeed in resolving this crisis by working \\nwith Russia, not against it.\\n\\nThat stability will be all the more sustainable if the \\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \\n(OSCE) — of which Switzerland this year holds the \\nchairmanship — is able to re-establish a firm basis for \\nsecurity cooperation between the Euro-Atlantic and \\nEurasian regions. Switzerland, in its capacity as current \\nchair of the OSCE, fully supports the vital work of the \\ncontact group for Ukraine and Russia. We are currently \\ntaking steps to increase funding for the special civil \\nmonitoring mission, that will also require additional \\nsupport from the participating States, and we welcome \\nthe excellent cooperation with the United Nations.\\n\\nIn today’s unstable world, Switzerland has made \\nan active commitment to achieving greater security \\nby focusing its efforts there where it can make the \\ngreatest contribution — the prevention of conflicts. \\nThe prevention of violence means, first and foremost \\nmaking certain that a proper education is available to all \\nand that there are opportunities for every young person. \\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s Global Education \\nFirst Initiative. Switzerland is working to promote \\neducation through massive open online courses and \\nseeks to encourage the development of dual vocational \\ntraining, combining school studies with on-the-job \\napprenticeships. This calls for a joint commitment on \\nthe part of the State and the social partners.\\n\\nIn addition, preventing tensions from arising \\nrequires knowing how to give everyone a voice. At the \\nheart of Switzerland’s history lies a willingness to share \\npower, to engage in direct dialogue with minorities, \\nand to distribute authority between central and local \\ngovernment — an emphasis on consultation rather than \\non confrontation. In order to better prevent and manage \\ntensions in the world, we must strengthen the mediation \\ncapacities of both the United Nations and regional \\nsecurity organizations, particularly those of the largest \\namong them, the OSCE.\\n\\nSwitzerland has decided to augment its \\ncontributions to international development and \\nhumanitarian cooperation. In the coming year we will \\nbe allocating funds for this purpose amounting to the \\nequivalent of 0.5 per cent of our gross national income. \\nIn other words, to help the neediest inhabitants of our \\nplanet, each person in Switzerland will be contributing \\na little over one dollar every day.\\n\\nThe post-2015 process provides us with the chance \\nto transform the world’s challenges into opportunities. \\nThere must be a single agenda for universal sustainable \\ndevelopment, with shared objectives. We must all act \\nto ensure that they are truly achieved. If all nations \\nare genuinely united, it lies within our power to \\nmake certain that no one in the world need face a \\nfuture of destitute poverty. It is within our power to \\nmake certain that the creation of jobs and wealth, and \\nthus also companies doing business contribute to the \\ndevelopment of human rights and help to foster respect \\nfor the limited resources of this Earth.\\n\\nToday there are crises that cannot wait for the \\noutcome of discussions on an agenda, no matter how \\nsustainable it may be. Switzerland has increased its \\nhumanitarian commitment to the fight against the \\nhorror of Ebola. Swiss-based research centres, among \\nthe best in the world, are working to arrange for the \\nclinical testing of vaccines. Similarly, we must also do \\nall we can every day to protect the world’s youth from \\nthe horrors of war. The place of children and young \\npeople is in school and with their families and not on \\nthe battlefield. Switzerland is intensifying its efforts to \\nprovide better health protection for women, especially \\nyoung girls, and has also launched an action plan to \\ncombat the phenomenon of child soldiers, who are \\nbeing deprived ofthe right to be simply children.\\n\\nIn order to meet these challenges we will need not \\nonly the common will of the United Nations but also an \\norganization that functions in an effective, transparent, \\nand democratic fashion. “We the peoples of the United \\nNations” are the opening words of the United Nations \\nCharter. They are a reminder that the United Nations \\nmust first listen to and serve the people of this world. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn concrete terms, this means that it must strengthen \\nbodies that are dedicated to the prevention of conflicts. \\nSwitzerland applauds the initiative of the Secretary-\\nGeneral to strengthen the commitment of the United \\nNations to human rights, particularly in sensitive \\nregions. My country has launched an appeal for the \\nallocation of additional funds for those important \\nactivities.\\n\\nThere is also a need to strengthen the United Nations \\nspecial political missions to prevent conflicts and \\nreinforce the activity of the Peacebuilding Commission. \\nThe United Nations must devote all its energy to its \\nwork in the field to serve the people. It must avoid \\ngetting lost in an administrative maze. Together with \\neight other countries, Switzerland has commissioned \\na group of experts to draft recommendations for the \\nreform of planning and budgeting processes.\\n\\nLastly, the ability of the United Nations to be \\neffective in dealing with the challenges it faces depends \\non the legitimacy it enjoys as well as its ability to be \\ntransparent and inclusive in the Security Council. The \\npermanent members ought not to use their veto to block \\naction designed to prevent or put an end to genocide, \\ncrimes against humanity, or war crimes. Switzerland \\nwelcomes the French initiative for a voluntary \\nagreement by the five permanent members to restrain \\ntheir veto power in cases of mass atrocities.\\n\\nOne day, many years ago, a young man travelling \\nacross the north of Italy was horrified by the suffering \\nhe witnessed on the battlefield at Solferino in the 1800s. \\nThe young man’s name was Henri Dunant. With the \\nhelp of local women, he cared for the wounded soldiers. \\nLater, when he returned home to Geneva, he dedicated \\nhimself to raising public awareness of the tragedy that \\nhad taken place. Through his commitment, the Red Cross \\nMovement was born. Through his persistence, the first \\nGeneva Convention was signed, 150 years ago in 1864. \\nThis document — which I am holding up here and will \\ngive to the President of the General Assembly — is a \\nreproduction of the original, in which States committed \\nthemselves to providing assistance to wounded soldiers \\nand ensuring respect for humanitarian principles. Thus, \\ninternational humanitarian law was born.\\n\\nYet today, 150 years later, humanitarian law is \\ntoo often violated or ignored. Switzerland and the \\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross were \\ngiven a mandate to consult States and to issue \\nrecommendations. We will present next year a specific \\nproposal to strengthen respect for humanitarian \\nlaw and to put in place some joint machinery and an \\ninstitutional framework. For the past 150 years, the \\nspirit of Geneva, the spirit of international law, has \\nshone forth throughout the world like a beacon, a place \\nof peace, a home to humanitarianism and a refuge for \\nhumankind. Geneva is a gift, both for Switzerland and \\nfor the world, and we would like to strengthen its role \\nfurther by finding useful solutions for humankind. Like \\nMalala and Damian, Henri Dunant dreamed of peace, \\nfreedom and prosperity for the world. His story — the \\nstory of the Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions — is \\na message of commitment. The action of each one of us \\ncan make a difference.\\n\\nIn a few days, Switzerland will rename one of the \\nhighest mountain peaks in the Alps. It will henceforth \\nbe known as Dunant Peak, after Henri Dunant, the \\nfirst recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Here, where \\nthe nations come together, we have the power to \\nmove mountains, as long as we stand united, working \\ntogether to make the dreams of Damian and Malala and \\nall young people in the world a reality. We owe them \\na better world. We are capable of building that world \\ntogether, if we find the will to work as nations truly \\nunited in dialogue and action — united nations, whose \\nGovernments draw their strength from the people, for \\nthe people; united nations who draw their inspiration \\nfrom the youth for the youth.\\n', 'The year \\n2014 is a special one for Europeans — a special year \\nof commemoration. In the summer 100 years ago, \\nEuropean diplomacy failed and the world slid into the \\nFirst World War. Seventy-five years ago, Germany \\nattacked its neighbour Poland, plunging the world into \\nthe Second World War. Twenty-five years ago, the \\nBerlin Wall fell, bringing an end to the world’s decades-\\nlong division into East and West.\\n\\nHowever, merely to look back and remember would \\nnot be enough in this year of commemoration. On the \\ncontrary, we must ask ourselves: what have we learned \\nfor the future? The most important lesson learned \\nfrom that history was the establishment of the United \\nNations, for the United Nations embodies the world’s \\nhope for peace. That hope derives from an idea which \\nis as simple as it is revolutionary: there is peace when \\nthe world sets rules for itself and replaces the law of \\nforce with the force of law, when conflicts are resolved \\nat the negotiating table and not on the battlefield, when \\nthe world renounces, step by step, the cynical logic of \\nviolence.\\n\\nTo date, the United Nations has provided a universal \\nfoundation for the hope for peace. But that universality \\nis under threat from the ghosts of the past and from new \\ndemons.\\n\\nIn 2014 our world seems to be unraveling. Crises are \\ncoming at us thick and fast. That is why it is not enough \\nsimply to call upon the United Nations. No, we need to \\nbreathe life into that call. Hope will remain but a hope, \\nan unattainable goal, unless States are prepared to take \\non responsibility. The United Nations is not a forum \\nonto which we can shrug off responsibility. The United \\nNations is a forum whereby we assume responsibility.\\n\\nGermany, embedded in a united Europe, is prepared \\nto take on responsibility in and with the United Nations. \\nFirst and foremost we have a responsibility to the people \\nbearing the brunt of the suffering in the crises.\\n\\nNext month Germany will host a conference in \\nBerlin to mobilize urgently needed humanitarian \\nassistance for the millions of Syrian refugees. My \\ncountry will play its part, and I sincerely hope that \\nmany others will follow suit. Support is needed above \\nall by Syria’s neighbours. They are doing a tremendous \\njob but are also under tremendous strain due to the huge \\ninflux of displaced persons and refugees from Syria.\\n\\nThe Ebola epidemic is raging in West Africa. \\nIt is bringing suffering and death into the homes of \\nindividual families. It is endangering the cohesion \\nof entire societies. That is why we are sending \\nhumanitarian and medical assistance and setting up an \\nairlift to the region. I am delighted that many volunteers \\nin my country have responded to the call, saying, “I \\nwant to go there to help on the spot”.\\n\\nAbove and beyond the immediate solidarity, \\nhowever, we need a long-term commitment. We need \\nthe expertise of the World Health Organization and \\nthe coordinating umbrella of the United Nations, \\nparticularly in the long term as we try to strengthen \\nStates and health-care systems. Germany will contribute \\nto both of those goals. We cannot bring the dead back to \\nlife, but we may be able to prevent far too many more \\npeople dying of Ebola who ought not to be dying if they \\nwere treated. And we must certainly make sure that the \\nnext epidemic does not have consequences as deadly as \\nthe one we are still fighting.\\n\\nIf we are to move towards the hope of peace, we need \\nmany small steps — the commitment of individuals, \\nbilateral diplomacy and regional initiatives. But none \\nof that can replace the United Nations. Only the United \\nNations can provide a universal foundation for the hope \\nof peace. That foundation is international law, to which \\neveryone who belongs to the community of nations in \\nthe United Nations, and those who want to belong, has \\nsubscribed. That is what must be preserved; that is the \\ncore of our hope for peace.\\n\\nThat is why I must here mention the conflict \\nin Ukraine. Some people in the Hall may regard it \\nas nothing more than a regional conflict in Eastern \\nEurope. But I am convinced that that view is incorrect. \\nI believe that that conflict affects each and every one of \\nus. Not just any State, but a permanent member of the \\nSecurity Council — Russia — has, with its annexation \\nof Crimea, unilaterally altered existing borders in \\nEurope and has thus violated international law. We \\nmust counter that dangerous sign, because we must not \\nallow the power of international law to be eroded from \\nthe inside. We must not allow the old divisions between \\nEast and West to re-emerge in the United Nations.\\n\\nBecause so much is at stake in that conflict, not \\nonly for the people of Ukraine but also for the future of \\ninternational law, Germany and its partners have taken \\non responsibility and committed themselves vigorously \\nto defusing the conflict. I am under no illusion: a \\npolitical solution is still a long way off. However, just a \\nfew weeks ago we were on the brink of a direct military \\nconfrontation between Russian and Ukrainian armed \\nforces. I am happy to say that diplomacy prevented the \\nworst. Now the priority must be to bring about a lasting \\nceasefire and achieve a political solution, one based on \\nthe principles of the United Nations and preserving the \\nunity of Ukraine.\\n\\nI am not discussing only Ukraine. As long as that \\nconflict is simmering and as long as Russia and the \\nWest are in a dispute over Ukraine, there is a threat \\nof paralysing the United Nations. We therefore need a \\nSecurity Council that is able and willing to act to tackle \\nthe new and, in the long term, far more important tasks \\nwe are facing. The world of 2014 is plagued not only by \\nthe old ghost of division, but also by new demons.\\n\\nWe are all shocked by the unspeakable brutality of \\nthe terrorists who misuse the name of God in carrying \\nout their evil deeds. My question is, ought we not to \\nbe particularly worried that the preachers of hate are \\ndrawing in young people who have grown up in the \\nmidst of our own societies?\\n\\nThat is why that, too, is not exclusively a regional \\nconflict — a problem in Iraq or in Syria or in Africa, \\n\\nwhere terrorists are stamping on the fundamental rights \\nof women and girls in particular. That barbarity is \\ndirected against every one of us, and against everything \\nfor which the United Nations stands.\\n\\nPrecisely for that reason, our response needs \\nto go much further than the immediately necessary \\nhumanitarian and military response. Germany is \\nmaking substantial contributions to both, including \\nmilitarily. But all that must be part of a political alliance \\nagainst the terror of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \\nMy country is strongly committed to that alliance, and \\nI very much hope in particular that the societies of the \\nMiddle East, realizing that far more is at stake than just \\ntheir security, will also join.\\n\\nIn a world haunted both by old ghosts and new \\ndemons, we have to be able to pursue both paths. On the \\none hand, we must steadfastly continue to work towards \\npolitical solutions in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in \\nSyria, but at the same time we must tackle the huge \\ntasks of the twenty-first century.\\n\\nI am referring to the fight against climate change. \\nGermany is contributing $1 billion dollars to the Green \\nClimate Fund. And we will support our closest partner, \\nFrance, on the road to a successful Paris climate summit \\nin 2015 and to a universal and legally binding climate \\nconvention, which we urgently need.\\n\\nI am also referring to the digital age. Yes, the \\nInternet should be a global, free, open and safe space. \\nBut that is not a matter solely for Government agencies \\nor big companies. That global, free, open and safe space \\nmust be shaped by society as a whole. If we fail to act, \\nthe vast technological possibilities will sweep aside the \\nhuman dimension. We need an international law for the \\ndigital world. Resolution 68/167, which we introduced \\ntogether with Brazil, has made a start in that direction, \\nI hope, at the United Nations.\\n\\nI am also referring to the post-2015 agenda, because \\nthe fight against poverty begins with asking how we \\nactually create value. How do we create prosperity? \\nThat question is not only directed at a few countries \\nin need of help. Rather, it is a call to the whole world \\nfor more sustainable economic activity. With its shift to \\nrenewable energies, Germany has set out on a path that, \\nalthough not easy, is one the world must take if we want \\nto preserve our natural resources and if the fight for \\nscarce resources, water and arable land is not to become \\nthe major conflict of the twenty-first century.\\n\\nOur children will judge us by those huge tasks. \\nThey will look back, just as we are looking back at \\nour forebears in this year of commemoration. Having \\nlearned from two World Wars, our forebears established \\nthe United Nations as their lesson to us. If we want to \\ncontinue that lesson, if we want to master the tasks \\nfacing us, then we must further develop this institution. \\nThe United Nations is not a finished product. Perhaps it \\nwill never be a finished product. It must evolve further, \\nso that in all its parts, including the Security Council, it \\nreflects today’s world.\\n\\nI believe that the United Nations is worth every \\neffort, for in it lives the world’s hope for peace and a \\nlegal order. I assure the Assembly that my country will \\nplay its part in making that hope a reality, step by step.\\n', 'On 17 July, in a summer \\nalready marked by alarming reports from Syria, \\nIraq and Gaza, our country was confronted with a \\n\\nstark international reality. The 298 passengers of \\nFlight MH-17 would be alive today if not for the Crimea \\nconflict and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Of \\nthose victims, 196 were Dutch nationals.\\n\\nThat tragedy has had an enormous impact on \\nour country — so many innocent men, women and \\nchildren, entire families ripped from neighbourhoods, \\nempty desks in offices and schools, teammates gone \\nforever. Everyone in the Netherlands knew someone in \\nthat plane, directly or indirectly, and we will feel the \\npain for years to come. Some of the victims still have \\nnot been identified, and that must be done as soon as \\npossible. Nothing is more important to their loved ones, \\nwherever in the world they may be.\\n\\nThis summer we were reminded again of how \\nclosely interwoven events at home and abroad can be \\nand how important a stable world order is to our national \\ninterests. We saw again that when it comes to addressing \\nthe major problems facing the global community, there \\nis simply no alternative to working together. That is the \\nfirm conviction of the Dutch Government.\\n\\nWe are grateful for the wide support for Security \\nCouncil resolution 2166 (2014). All remains and personal \\nbelongings must be repatriated. The cause of the Flight \\nMH-17 disaster must be brought to light, and those \\nresponsible must be brought to justice. Unhindered \\naccess to the crash site is therefore essential. The Dutch \\nGovernment is fully committed to achieving those \\ngoals, working with all the countries and organizations \\ninvolved.\\n\\nThe Constitution of the Netherlands contains a \\nunique article that says, “The Government shall promote \\nthe development of the international legal order”. That \\nself-imposed responsibility comes from a long tradition \\nof freedom, respect for the rule of law and our country’s \\ninternational orientation. In March, we put that principle \\ninto practice once again when we hosted the Nuclear \\nSecurity Summit, a conference on an important topic \\nthat must remain high on the international agenda. The \\nevents of this summer have made us even more resolute \\nabout promoting the international legal order and about \\nworking to that end with everyone here in the General \\nAssembly, in the knowledge that peace, justice and \\ndevelopment are closely interconnected.\\n\\nThe year 2015 is an important one for the global \\ndevelopment agenda. We will be reviewing the \\nMillennium Development Goals and raising the \\nbar once again. In July this year, the Open Working \\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid \\nfoundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands’ \\npriorities. The most important goal is to eradicate \\nextreme poverty within a generation in a way that \\ndoes not harm economic growth, social equality or the \\nenvironment. We must link short-term goals with long-\\nterm goals.\\n\\nDespite the progress made, we know that fragile \\nStates, where the rule of law barely exists, had no \\nchance of achieving the Millennium Development \\nGoals. In 2013 there were more displaced people in \\nconflict regions than ever before. For those reasons, \\nthe Netherlands applauds the Open Working Group’s \\nintention to include peace and the rule of law in the new \\nframework.\\n\\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s announced \\nintention to establish the United Nations Mission for \\nEbola Emergency Response. The Netherlands will \\nsubstantially increase its humanitarian aid. Part of that \\neffort is a new contribution of €18 million to the fight \\nagainst Ebola.\\n\\nIn the same vein, the Netherlands will continue to \\nsupport and participate in United Nations peacekeeping \\nmissions. We currently have military personnel and \\nrelief workers serving in Mali, South Sudan and \\nelsewhere. The upcoming review of peacekeeping \\nmissions is an opportunity to improve the instrument \\nand make it more effective. The Netherlands believes \\nthat major progress can be made on that front by further \\nintegrating the three Ds: defence, development and \\ndiplomacy.\\n\\nOur commitment to fulfilling Security Council \\nresolution 1325 (2000) remains firm too, because \\nwomen’s leadership is essential to achieving peace and \\nsecurity. The important role that women play as change \\nagents in politics, economic development and society \\ncannot be emphasized enough.\\n\\nAs host country to many international legal \\ninstitutions, including the International Court of Justice \\nand the International Criminal Court, the Netherlands \\nfeels a special responsibility with respect to international \\nlaw. When innocent people fall victim to impunity, \\nhuman rights violations and the violence of war, the \\ninternational community cannot and should not just \\nstand by and just watch. Perpetrators must be brought \\nto justice, however complex and time-consuming the \\nprocess may be. We owe this not only to the passengers \\nof Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, but also to the \\n\\nvictims of violence in Syria and in Iraq. The horrifying \\nimages of mass executions and beheadings in the region \\nare burned into our memories. They impress upon \\nus how important it is for the Security Council and \\ninternational legal institutions to be able to act boldly \\nand decisively.\\n\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands, a partner for \\npeace, justice and development, is a candidate for a \\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2017 \\nand 2018. We want to help modernize and strengthen \\nthat important United Nations body. Renewal is \\nneeded to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy. The \\nSecurity Council must be able to act in a crisis. When \\nmass atrocities are being committed somewhere in the \\nworld, veto power should be exercised with greater \\nrestraint. We salute the French initiative in that regard. \\nWe also believe that the Security Council’s authority \\nand resolve would be enhanced if the United Nations \\nMember States were more broadly represented. That \\nis especially true of the African States which, in our \\nopinion, are underrepresented.\\n\\nIn closing, Dag Hammarskjöld once said that\\n\\n“[t]he principles of the Charter are, by far, greater \\nthan the Organization in which they are embodied, \\nand the aims which they are to safeguard are holier \\nthan the policies of any single nation or people” \\n(S/PV.751, para. 4).\\nThe Netherlands shares that conviction and remains \\nsteadfast in its commitment to promoting the \\ninternational legal order, as our Constitution demands.\\n', 'It is with great respect that \\nI stand at this rostrum for the first time as Austrian \\nForeign Minister. Many eminent world leaders have \\nstood here before me and laid out their visions on \\ninternational challenges and crises. As many may be \\nable to tell, probably even from the last row, I look a bit \\nyounger than most of the speakers before me. Indeed, \\nI believe I am the only person under the age of 30 who \\nhas the privilege of speaking here this week. So while \\nI cannot speak from many years of experience, what I \\ncan offer is the perspective of a young generation.\\n\\nMy generation is the post-Cold War generation. \\nThe Iron Curtain collapsed 25 years ago, when I was 3 \\nyears old. For us in Europe, the years after the collapse \\nof the Iron Curtain were years filled with hope and new \\nopportunities. We could travel freely, study in foreign \\ncountries and meet people from all over the world. \\nWe grew up in a society where human rights were \\nrespected, where the rule of law was a given, and where \\nreligious freedom was practised. We communicate \\nwithout borders on Facebook and Twitter, we have our \\nentire lives stored on our smartphone, and we consume \\nthe news online.\\n\\nWhile the world after the Cold War offered \\nfascinating new opportunities, it also proved to be not \\norderly at all, but quite messy and more uncertain than \\nmany had predicted. Just two years after the Berlin Wall \\ncame down, war returned to Europe in the Western \\nBalkan countries. Thankfully, the horrors came to an \\nend, and these countries now have a clear European \\nperspective. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, we \\nbelieved that the world would move forward and that \\nmore and more people would benefit from the same \\nopportunities that my generation in Western Europe \\nenjoyed. But the world today seems to be shifting \\ninto reverse. We are facing situations and horrors we \\nthought we had overcome many years ago. For young \\npeople like myself, who learned about the Cold War \\nonly through history books, it seems unbelievable that \\nthe thinking in terms of confrontational blocs could \\nreturn to Europe.\\n\\nThe crisis in Ukraine is probably the most serious \\nchallenge to peace and security Europe has had to face \\nin decades. In retrospect, it is easy to claim that this \\ndevelopment should have been predictable, and that we \\nshould have foreseen it. But let us be honest. Who would \\nhave predicted that, after three years of negotiations, \\nPresident Yanukovych would refuse to sign the \\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union? Who \\nwould have predicted that the Maidan movement would \\nbe strong enough to force him to leave the country? \\nAnd who would have predicted that Russia would react \\nby annexing Crimea and would even actively support \\nseparatist movements?\\n\\nWe cannot accept that international law should \\nbe violated and that recognized borders challenged in \\nEurope once again. At the same time, we need to find \\n\\na political solution that goes beyond a mere ceasefire. \\nWe need a solution that offers the prospect of a free, \\nstable and united Ukraine, a Ukraine which enjoys \\nstrong economic ties with both the European Union \\nand the Russian Federation. Let us not return to Cold \\nWar thinking, where two blocs face each other. Our \\npolitical guideline must be to move from a policy of \\n“either Europe or Russia” to a logic of “both Europe \\nand Russia”.\\n\\nSome people have claimed that Ukraine would \\nnot be in this situation had it not given up its nuclear \\nweapons. This kind of thinking is dangerous. And we \\nhave to ask ourselves, where would this lead us? As \\nlong as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use, on \\npurpose or by accident, remains real. Let us be clear: \\nthe use of nuclear weapons, more than any other human \\naction, has the potential to end life on this planet. And, \\n69 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, let us not \\nforget that the humanitarian consequences of a single \\nnuclear explosion are terrifying and long-lasting. The \\ndesire to prevent the humanitarian consequences of \\nnuclear weapons should unite us all. We therefore hope \\nthat the Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of \\nNuclear Weapons in Vienna in December will mark a \\nreal change of direction in international discussions on \\nnuclear weapons.\\n\\nLooking beyond our region, we are currently \\nwitnessing a further rise of extremism in the name of \\nreligion, and a new development — foreign terrorist \\nfighters who come from Western countries and travel \\nto the Middle East in order to join the fight. There \\nis no time to lose; we must actively address what is \\nhappening in northern Iraq, where the so-called Islamic \\nState of Iraq and the Levant is attempting to wipe out \\nentire religious communities, where children are being \\nbeheaded, mothers raped and fathers hanged because of \\ntheir beliefs.\\n\\nIn Europe, we estimate that there are thousands of \\nforeign fighters with European passports. In our case, \\nthere are more than 140 people from Austria fighting \\nin the name of a so-called holy war. We all know that \\nthe terrorist organizations operate worldwide. They \\nget their terrorist fighters by recruiting globally. They \\nfinance themselves through global networks. They \\nbuy arms and other resources on a global scale. And \\nthey use, or rather abuse, the global communication \\nnetworks to their benefit.\\n\\nHow is it possible that terrorist organizations have \\naccess to financial and economic resources that allow \\nthem to operate so effectively? How is it possible that \\nwe allow terrorist organizations to abuse the right to \\nfreedom of expression by showing their barbaric acts \\non social media? And how is it possible that they are \\nable to recruit new fighters within our societies?\\n\\nWe all, Governments and the private sector as well, \\nhave a duty to develop preventive measures within our \\nsocieties to stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, \\nto cut off financial support to their organizations and \\nto put an end to the abuse of social media networks \\nby developing forms of voluntary self-restriction for \\nthose networks. The adoption of Security Council \\nresolution 2178 (2014) this week was an important first \\nstep, but now we must implement it. And we should \\nalways remind ourselves that the battle lines in this \\nconfrontation are not limited to Iraq or Syria. They run \\nthrough our own Western societies.\\n\\nMy generation in Austria was privileged to grow \\nup in freedom from fear and from want. There are, of \\ncourse, other stories to be told of young people growing \\nup in Afghanistan or the Central African Republic, for \\nexample. Today half of the world’s population is under \\n25 years of age, and many of them lack adequate nutrition, \\nhealth care, education and jobs. All in all, those are not \\ngreat prospects for life. The work of the United Nations \\non development is therefore crucial to lifting millions \\nof people out of poverty, helping the hungry and the \\nsick and educating new generations around the world. \\nThe United Nations needs and deserves our support, \\nand I can assure the Assembly that Austria fully stands \\nbehind the post-2015 development agenda.\\n\\nBut we must also ensure that respect for human \\nrights and the rule of law receive proper attention. Only \\na society that respects the rights of its citizens can enable \\neach individual to develop his or her potential. We are \\ntherefore very pleased to be organizing the Second \\nUnited Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing \\nCountries, to be held in Vienna in November. And we \\nare honoured that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \\nagreed to attend the Conference.\\n\\nI am aware that the list of challenges that the \\ninternational community and the United Nations are \\nfacing is long: the situations in Iraq, Ukraine, Syria, \\nGaza, the Central African Republic and Mali and the \\noutbreak of the Ebola disease, to name just a few. In \\nview of those challenges, the United Nations needs and \\ndeserves our full support. I want to especially thank \\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts \\nat the helm of the United Nations. I can assure him \\n\\nthat Austria remains committed to working actively \\nwithin the United Nations and its bodies to support his \\nwork and to address our global challenges, whether as \\npeacekeepers, through our presidency of the Economic \\nand Social Council or as a member of the Human \\nRights Council. We are particularly proud to host the \\nUnited Nations Office at Vienna, which has become \\nan Austrian landmark. Austria has a long tradition of \\nbuilding bridges and serving as a place for international \\ndialogue. We will continue to do so in the future and to \\noffer our contribution to making the world a little bit \\nsafer and better for the generations to come.\\n', 'Myriam Riva, Emmanuel Riva, Dominique Sabrier, \\nAlexandre Strens — these are the names of the four \\npeople brutally murdered on 24 May in Brussels. Four \\npeople were killed just because they were in a Jewish \\nmuseum, an institution dedicated to culture, knowledge \\nand intelligence. I named these four victims, but I do \\nnot forget the thousands of anonymous victims of \\nbarbarism around the world. For the abject act that took \\nplace at the Jewish Museum in Brussels is connected to \\nthe events sweeping the world right now. In Syria and \\nIraq, as well as in countries like Algeria, terrorists kill \\ninnocent people every day.\\n\\nSyria and Iraq are of special concern to us. There, \\ndefenceless people, women and children are victims of \\nmassacres, persecution, destruction and the theft of all \\ntheir possessions — all because they belong to cultures, \\nincluding the Muslim culture, that the terrorists do not \\nagree with. Yet, no religion, and certainly not Islam, \\nasserts that we must kill those who think differently. \\nWe have to say this over and over again in order to \\nremove any excuse for these criminals who sow terror.\\n\\nThe personal history of the alleged perpetrator \\nof the attack against the Jewish Museum in Brussels \\nresonates with all of us. It is that of a French jihadist \\nwho visited Syria in the ranks of the so-called Islamic \\nState. This jihadist then moved across Europe before \\ncommitting the irreparable. It is common trajectory for \\nmany of these foreign fighters. These foreign fighters \\nare a threat to every country in the world. Security \\nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), adopted the day before \\nyesterday, is an important step towards a coordinated \\nglobal response. We must and we shall put these \\nterrorists in a position where they can no longer inflict \\nharm.\\n\\nBeyond the humanitarian support it has already \\nbrought to the Iraqi people, Belgium recently decided \\nto send six F-16 fighters in support of the fight against \\nterrorism in Iraq. My country also wants to strengthen \\ncooperation among States. Belgium wants to intensify \\nthe exchange of information at the European level and \\nwithin NATO. As required by the Security Council \\nresolution, a major preventive effort must also be made \\nto prevent jihadist aspirants from reaching the combat \\nzones. We must prevent the recruitment, training and \\ntransportation of our citizens who may be tempted to \\njoin terrorist groups. For minors in particular, each \\ncountry must demonstrate a total vigilance regarding \\nborder control.\\n\\nThe battle we are waging against terrorism reflects \\na conflict between two understandings of life: respect \\nfor human beings, which we have and the terrorists do \\nnot; defence of freedom everywhere and always, which \\nthe terrorists do not want; tolerance, while the terrorists \\n\\n\\npreach and impose intolerance. For us, life is priceless; \\nfor them, it has no value.\\n\\nWe know that military actions alone are not enough. \\nHere, as there, what is needed is to focus on education, \\neducational support, openness to others and the world. \\nOur goal should be to deradicalize violent radicals. I \\ncannot help but think that the human disaster we are \\nwitnessing is also the result of a crushing defeat — that \\nof politicians who favoured military solutions and the \\nnotorious so-called preventive war.\\n\\nA few years ago, Belgium refused to participate \\nin such an operation in Iraq. How can we not see that \\nfrustration and humiliation have further strengthened \\nradicalism? Things being what they are, we must \\nnow deal with the emergency, and act, including \\nmilitarily. But we must also consider the future and \\ninvest sustainably in civil action. Everywhere, the \\nestablishment of a State that protects its citizens must \\nbe the priority. Strengthening the rule of law and \\nimproving living conditions is the best crisis prevention. \\nSuch responses are also much less expensive than the \\nday-to-day management of uprisings and violence. In \\nmany crises today, we see the States concerned in a \\nposition of great weakness or even virtual failure.\\n\\nThe appointment of a new Prime Minister in Iraq \\nsends the right signal of inclusion and tolerance. Let \\nme mention other illustrations of this principle. With \\nregard to the Middle East, this summer we watched \\nin despair the launching of rockets in Israel and the \\nmassive bombing of Gaza. More than 2,100 Palestinian \\nand 67 Israeli lives were lost in combat. War is not a \\nsolution. There is no other way to achieve peace — one \\nbased on two States coexisting in security — except by \\nreturning to negotiations. The status quo is obviously \\nnot an option. We must put the settlement of the Israeli-\\nPalestinian conflict back at the top of the international \\nagenda. That settlement will also constitute an \\nimportant factor in the stabilization and peace of the \\nentire region and the world. Therefore, we welcome the \\nefforts of President Obama in that regard, and we hope \\nthat he will continue up to the last day of his mandate \\nto work in that direction.\\n\\nThe Arab Spring is another example of what I \\nam talking about. It was a legitimate revolution and it \\nspeaks to true aspirations for democracy and prosperity. \\nWe must note that in some countries, chaos and terror \\nhave long reigned over democracy, while in others we \\nare witnessing a return to State totalitarianism. In that \\nregard, the international community must do everything \\npossible to encourage democracy peace and prosperity.\\n\\nWith regard to Africa, with which Belgium shares \\na long common history, it is in constant forward motion \\nand far removed from common clichés. We must \\nstrongly support its economic, educational and political \\ndevelopment. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \\nin particular in the east of the country, putting armed \\ngroups where they can no longer do harm is an urgent \\nnecessity. In Sahel, Mali and the Central African \\nRepublic, the fight against religious extremism is \\nwhere our priorities should lie. We must also mobilize \\nto support populations in Africa that are dealing with \\nthe horrific Ebola epidemic.\\n\\nOn the fringes of Europe, we are seeing a broad \\ndestabilization. Internationally recognized borders are \\nbeing violated, and Ukraine is facing a major challenge \\nto be inclusive and representative for both the minorities \\nand the majority of the population in Ukraine.\\n\\nWith regard to Flight MH-17, in which six \\nBelgian citizens died, the currently known facts are \\nincriminating and we eagerly await the final report of \\nthe independent experts, who must have free access to \\nthe site and responses to all of their requests.\\n\\nWe will have peace only if tolerance triumphs \\nover barbarism. And we must act together. Therefore, \\nI welcome the American initiative to launch a process \\nof reflection on the role of the United Nations in \\npeacekeeping. The role of the United Nations in the \\nprevention and settlement of conflicts is irreplaceable. \\nIt is the only place where the representatives of the entire \\nworld can talk to each other. To be sure, the functioning \\nof the Organization should evolve and recognize that \\nthe right to veto has sometimes been used to prevent \\naction from being taken. I am open to the consideration \\nthat has begun in that regard. However, the common \\nhouse that is the United Nations should be preserved at \\nany price and encouraged to act. That is why I would \\nlike to thank our Secretary-General for his unwavering \\nefforts to further improve its functioning.\\n\\nOur world continues to present us with insufferable \\ncontrasts. Too many human beings are today living in \\nextreme poverty. They do not have safe access to water or \\nbasic health services and they suffer from malnutrition. \\nWho can believe that people will resign themselves to \\nsuch a situation and that there will not be yet another \\nscandal if they do? The international community — the \\nGroup of Seven and the Organization for Economic \\n\\n\\nCooperation and Development — are beginning to deal \\nwith tax evasion. That is extremely important, as is the \\nfight against corruption. There will not be great human \\nprogress without a moralization of finance at the global \\nlevel. Our responsibility in that regard is huge.\\n\\nToo many women and men do not have access to \\na job or to housing, only because they are of foreign \\norigin. Too many women are subject to moral or \\nphysical violence only because they are women. Too \\nmany people — lesbians, homosexuals, bisexuals and \\ntransgender people — are persecuted and rejected only \\nbecause they are different or they love differently. It \\nis also our responsibility to denounce and combat all \\ntogether and systematically those injustices and attacks \\non human rights.\\n\\nAs a crossroads of many cultures, Belgium has \\nalways been one of the most open countries in the \\nworld. It has a high standard of living. And although \\nI think they are still too great, the inequalities there \\nare the smallest in Europe. That is largely due to the \\ncivil support, which is organized by the Belgian State. \\nIn particular, our health system is exceptional and \\nis accessible to everyone. Moreover, Belgium is a \\nmulticultural country both through its demography and \\nits abundant and diverse migration. In our country, the \\nrespect for the other and the culture of compromise are \\npart of our cultural heritage.\\n\\nBelgium, like the European Union, is moving on a \\npath of solidarity with peoples who are encountering \\ndifficulties. We want to help them to achieve their \\nlegitimate aspirations for a more just world. We must \\nalso remain vigilant so that we do not fall into the trap \\nof social regression and increasing inequalities. All the \\nethical progress that we have achieved is precious and \\nmust be preserved.\\n\\nI will conclude by saying that human fraternity is \\nnot a utopia. It is what has often allowed us to make \\ngreat progress. We must go beyond borders to form \\nnew types of cooperation, reduce inequalities and bring \\nabout new hope. The most powerful obstacle to war \\nand violence is human fraternity. It is that fraternity \\nthat will enable us tomorrow to better share the \\nplanet’s resources, to offer a future to each and every \\nchild and to make sure that peace reigns everywhere \\nand for everyone. Members of the Assembly may rest \\nassured that my country will continue to do everything \\nit can to bring peoples together. We believe in sharing \\nand solidarity, and we thus find it entirely natural to \\ncontinue to support Member States in their many \\nstruggles for peace and justice.\\n', 'The \\nAssembly will understand that I am speaking today \\nwith particular emotion, because one of my compatriots \\nhas just been the subject of a cowardly assassination in \\nAlgeria by a terrorist group linked to Daesh. His name \\nwas Hervé Gourdel. He was a man full of enthusiasm \\nwho loved mountains and thought that he would be able \\nto pursue his passion by going to the Djurdjura area in \\nAlgeria. He was captured, and he was decapitated. That \\nis what terrorism does. And it does not do that only to \\nFrance. Several days ago it was American and British \\nindividuals subjected to the same barbarity.\\n\\nThat group — Daesh — does not strike only those \\nwho think differently from themselves; they also strike \\nMuslims, they strike civilian populations, and they \\nstrike minorities. They rape, they kill. That is why \\nthe battle that the international community must wage \\nagainst terrorism knows no borders. The same flag must \\nbe carried, that of the United Nations, that of the values \\nfor which this Organization was founded — human \\ndignity, freedom, the vision we must have of a world of \\ntomorrow, a world of justice.\\n\\nFrance is fully engaged in this battle. That was \\nthe case in Africa when it was called to Mali, where, \\nfortunately, it was joined by many African and European \\ncountries and now by the United Nations. France has \\nbeen engaged whenever there is a risk. But today it is \\nin Iraq and Syria where that threat exists. But it does \\nnot concern that region alone, because the Daesh group \\nhas decided not only to conquer territory, imagining \\nthat it will found a State; it threatens the entire world \\nby provoking attacks, organizing kidnappings and \\nrecruiting fighters from around the world to train them \\nand show them the barbarity of which the group is \\ncapable, so they may reproduce that horrific terrorist \\nmovement in our own countries.\\n\\nIt is because this threat exists not only for the \\nregion but for the world that France responded to the \\nIraqi authorities’ appeal to provide them first with \\nmilitary aid through the delivery of weapons this past \\nAugust and also with aerial support to keep the Daesh \\ngroup from being able to continue its advance. We want \\nto weaken it. We want to quash it.\\n\\nBut we also know that as long as there is no \\nsettlement of the Syrian crisis, all our efforts risk being \\nundermined. So the challenge is not only to act against \\nDaesh, but also to achieve a political solution. We in \\nFrance support the democratic Syrian opposition. We \\nconsider it the sole legitimate representative of the \\nSyrian people. In that case, too, we will not back down; \\nwe will not compromise because of threats. The Bashar \\nAl-Assad regime deserves to be condemned because \\nthey are complicit in what has been going on for the \\npast three years in Syria — 200,000 deaths and so \\nmany displaced persons.\\n\\nThis is a sad time for France, with the death — the \\nmurder — of one of our citizens, but France will never \\ngive in to blackmail, pressure or barbarous acts. On the \\ncontrary, France knows what is expected of it. France \\nknows that it upholds values, France knows it has a role \\nto play and will never abandon that role, and that the \\nfight against terrorism will be continued and expanded \\nas much as necessary within respect for the rule of law \\nand the sovereignty of States, for we make no mistake \\nwhen we act. We will always act with respect for the \\nprinciples of the United Nations.\\n\\nI also wanted to talk to about other things, but \\nit must be understood that a great question is being \\nasked of my country and also of the Assembly. When \\nfaced with barbarism, with terrorism, will we remain \\nspectators, or will we be actors together in what should \\nbe a just international order? The question, if we do \\nnot respond to it, or if we respond too weakly, then \\nterrorists will continue their business of recruitment \\nand indoctrination. It is not weakness that will be the \\nresponse to terrorism; it is force — the force of law, \\nthe force of the United Nations. At a certain point also, \\nit will be the force of military action when it becomes \\nnecessary.\\n\\nI also wanted to talk about other regions of the \\nworld that are facing threats that also affect our own \\nsecurity. I want to talk to the Assembly about the Ebola \\nepidemic, because I know just how much it is affecting \\nour African friends. But again, let us look beyond those \\nwho are affected. Who can imagine that the epidemic \\nwill remain confined to just a few countries if we do \\nnot intervene? It is also a global threat. Again, the \\nresponse must be a global. Therefore, France, Europe \\n\\n\\nand the world must provide to the countries affected by \\nthe epidemic the necessary medical care, indispensable \\nprotection and economic assistance that is expected. \\nBecause again, if there is the slightest weakness, the \\nslightest failure to show solidarity, all of our countries \\nwill be affected.\\n\\nI have also come here before the General Assembly \\nto speak about what is happening in Europe and next to \\nEurope, to speak about what occurred in Ukraine and \\nthe failures there to uphold principles of international \\nlaw. But what is at stake today, even in Europe, is peace \\nand ensuring that the ceasefire that was agreed can be \\ntransformed into a lasting solution to the conflict.\\n\\nNo continent has been spared from any threat. \\nEverything is fragile, everything is precarious, \\neverything is vulnerable. We have to have the same \\nawareness of the risks, the dangers and the perils that \\nwe had right after the Second World War. We must not \\nthink that all we have to do is remember; we have to \\nthink of the future, of the world we want. The world \\nthat we want is the final subject I wish to address here.\\n\\nThe world that we want has to be one of profound \\nchange. The present disorder also threatens not only \\nour generation but naturally those that will follow \\nus. It threatens our very security, as there are more \\ndisplaced persons resulting from climate imbalance \\nthan from wars, which are sadly so intense and deadly \\non our planet. France has lived up to its responsibilities \\nin that area too. We decided to organize the climate \\nconference in December 2015. I am pleased that thanks \\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, there was a summit \\nhere that mobilized awareness, States, financial \\ninstitutions, businesses and civil society. Many events \\ntook place. We have to succeed at the Paris conference, \\nnot because it will take place in Paris, but because it is \\nthe world’s appointment with itself.\\n\\nThere are periods in history when we have the \\npower to decide, and decide not just for ourselves but \\nfor humankind. This is one of those moments. Therefore \\nin Paris, we have to do everything can be done to reach \\na comprehensive, binding agreement that differentiates \\naccording to levels of development, everything so that \\nthere can be that Green Climate Fund, to which France \\nhas contributed $1 billion for the coming years. I hope \\nthat other countries follow our example, because we \\nneed that Green Fund to allow less developed countries \\nto grow and to succeed in their energy transition at the \\nsame time.\\n\\nThis is a sad moment that I am living today on \\nbehalf of France, that the French are experiencing, but \\nit is also a moment of awakening and responsibility. For \\nthe world, for the planet, we must fight terrorism, we \\nmust act in favour of peace, we must reduce inequalities, \\nwe must also do our duty for future generations. We \\nmust ensure that the Paris conference is successful \\nfor the sake of the climate. We must make certain that \\nthe United Nations can remain faithful to the mandate \\ngiven to it after a war — a terrible war. We are still \\nfacing challenges, but we are certain to meet them if we \\nare united and come together to claim victory.', '\\nIt is a great honour for me to address the General \\nAssembly for the first time, and I must say that I do \\nso with great emotion. Commitment, solidarity and \\nresponsibility are the three key words that have guided \\nand will continue to guide my country’s action at the \\nUnited Nations. As a founding Member of the United \\nNations, Luxembourg has based its foreign policy on \\nactive participation in multilateral cooperation. That \\nmultilateralism is founded on respect for international \\nlaw and cooperation among sovereign and equal States \\nin order to work collectively for peace, development \\nand respect for human rights.\\n\\nFor us, the United Nations is at the heart of \\nmultilateralism. We are committed to making the \\nUnited Nations as effective as possible so that we can \\nsolve together, in solidarity, issues that far exceed \\nour capacities as States. We have the responsibility to \\novercome such issues for the sake of future generations. \\nCommitment, solidarity and responsibility also define \\nthe approach that should guide our response to the \\nchallenges facing us on the eve of 2015.\\n\\n\\nWith the President’s choice of the theme for this \\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, he calls \\nupon us to develop and deliver on a transformative post-\\n2015 development agenda and to ensure its effective \\nimplementation. That post-2015 development agenda \\nmust be bold and ambitious if we are to live up to our \\ncollective responsibility to eradicate poverty and to \\npromote sustainable development. It must build on the \\nMillennium Development Goals and must go further. \\nThe agenda must be holistic, action-oriented and \\nuniversally applicable. It must benefit both developing \\nand developed countries. It must be based on human \\nrights. It must give the social sectors, health care and \\neducation all the importance that they deserve. The \\nissues of governance, justice, peace and security, as \\nwell as the protection of the environment, sustainable \\nconsumption and production patterns and sustained \\neconomic growth, must be part of that agenda.\\n\\nLuxembourg supports and welcomes the important \\nwork accomplished by the Open Working Group on \\nSustainable Development Goals. Its report (A/67/941, \\nannex) and the set of goals that it proposes are a useful \\nbasis for the negotiations that will culminate in a year’s \\ntime in the adoption of the post-2015 development \\nagenda and a new model for sustainable development \\nthat reconciles “the ambitions of humanity and the needs \\nof the planet”, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.\\n\\nAware of its international responsibilities, \\nmy country has a long-standing commitment to \\ndevelopment, motivated by a desire for solidarity with \\nthe poorest people. Since 2000, Luxembourg has been \\none of the five industrialized countries to allocate at least \\n0.7 per cent of its gross national income to development \\ncooperation. In 2009, our development assistance \\nreached the level of 1 per cent of gross national income. \\nThe Government is committed to maintaining that high \\nlevel despite a difficult budgetary position, which is no \\neasier in our country than in others. Such aid can offer \\nupcoming generations prospects and opportunities for \\nthe future and, we should realize, can therefore, I hope, \\nprevent certain conflicts.\\n\\nThe fight against climate change is an integral part of \\nany global partnership for development. In that context, \\nallow me to welcome the holding of the climate summit \\non Tuesday. That summit clearly achieved the dual \\nobjective set by the Secretary-General: to demonstrate \\nthe essential political will to reach a global agreement \\nin 2015 and to act as a catalyst for concrete action on \\nthe ground so as to reduce emissions and to increase \\nresilience. In the second half of 2015, my country will \\nassume the presidency of the Council of the European \\nUnion (EU). We will spare no effort to ensure that we \\nreach an international climate agreement at the 2015 \\nParis climate summit that is applicable to all countries, \\nwith the objective of keeping global warming below \\n2°C.\\n\\nWith its European Union partners, Luxembourg has \\nmade binding commitments to reduce its greenhouse \\ngas emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate \\nchange. Before the upcoming meetings, in accordance \\nwith the timetable that we agreed in Warsaw, the \\nEuropean Union will present additional contributions \\nto rise to the challenge.\\n\\nWe are also making commitments at the national \\nlevel. I would mention, for example, our support for the \\nstatement on carbon pricing, presented at the Climate \\nSummit, as well as the new contribution of €5 million \\nto the Green Climate Fund, which we announced \\nat the summit, without any reduction in our official \\ndevelopment assistance.\\n\\nThere will be no development without security and \\nno security without development. And both development \\nand security also depend on respect for human rights \\nand the rule of law. We all know Kofi Annan’s saying. \\nLuxembourg has made it the guiding principle of its \\naction in the Security Council since 1 January 2013 \\nby devoting its undivided attention to the root causes \\nof conflict, their humanitarian and economic impact \\nand human rights, in particular the rights of children \\naffected by conflict.\\n\\nTo illustrate that approach, I will talk about \\nthe conflict in Syria. That conflict, which has been \\nraging for three and a half years, now shocks the \\nhuman conscience. There are more than 191,000 \\npeople dead. There are 10.8 million Syrians in need of \\nurgent humanitarian assistance, over half of whom are \\nchildren. More than 4.5 million Syrians are trapped by \\nthe fighting in areas that are difficult for humanitarian \\nactors to access. More than 3 million Syrians have been \\nforced to leave their country, over 1 million of whom \\nare refugees in Lebanon. Those figures rarely make the \\nheadlines now. However, behind those figures, there is \\nso much suffering and so many shattered lives.\\n\\nThat cannot continue. We must put an end to the \\nindiscriminate attacks against civilians, schools and \\nhospitals, the bombardment with barrel bombs, the \\ndenial of humanitarian assistance and the use of famine \\n\\n\\nas a weapon of war. At the initiative of Australia, Jordan \\nand Luxembourg, the Security Council unanimously \\nadopted two resolutions on access for humanitarian aid \\nto Syria (Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) and \\n2165 (2014)). I strongly hope that those resolutions will \\nhave a real and decisive impact on the ground.\\n\\nHowever, humanitarian action cannot be a \\nsubstitute for political action. The lasting settlement \\nof the Syrian conflict requires a political solution — a \\npolitical transition that meets the legitimate aspirations \\nof the Syrian people, in accordance with the Geneva \\ncommuniqué of June 2012 (S/2012/522, annex).\\n\\nToday, we cannot procrastinate in the face of the \\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity committed \\nby terrorist groups, in particular the Islamic State in \\nIraq and the Levant. That group is neither a State nor \\nIslamic. It defiles Islam and seeks only to spread its \\nterror regime and to destabilize Syria, Iraq and the \\nentire region.\\n\\nMy country fully supports the measures adopted \\nagainst individuals and entities associated with \\nAl-Qaida to cut off their channels of financing, to \\nprevent radicalization and to stem the flow of foreign \\nterrorist fighters. We do so pursuant to Security \\nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), which we adopted the \\nday before yesterday at the Security Council summit \\npresided over by the United States President, Barack \\nObama, in which I had the honour to particiapte.\\n\\nBeyond the fight against terrorism, we must tackle \\nthe root causes of the grave crisis in Iraq. In that \\ncontext, we welcome the formation of the new Iraqi \\nGovernment of national unity, under the leadership of \\nPrime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. We encourage him \\nto follow an inclusive approach that respects all ethnic \\nand religious segments of Iraqi society and that is \\nresponsive to the needs and aspirations of all. The Iraqi \\npeople must regain trust in their country’s democratic \\ninstitutions.\\n\\nFor the third time in six years, this summer we \\nwitnessed bloody fighting in the Gaza Strip. The cycle \\nof violence must stop. The actions that fuel hatred \\nand discord must cease. Israelis and Palestinians must \\nfinally be able to live in peace, security and dignity. \\nThe two-State solution, the peaceful coexistence of \\ntwo democratic States — Israel and Palestine — within \\nsecure and recognized borders, remains the only \\npossible way forward in that regard. A political solution \\nmust be sought as soon as possible to avoid extremists \\nfrom all sides from prevailing and to avoid measures \\nbeing taken that would make the two-State solution \\nimpossible. With its partners in the European Union, \\nLuxembourg is ready to contribute to a global and \\nsustainable solution.\\n\\nThe time allotted to me does not suffice to do \\njustice to the manifold crises that we face today. I \\nwould, however, like to say that they all bring one duty \\nto light, namely, to protect civilians. That duty is at \\nthe heart of the mandates entrusted to the stabilization \\nand peacekeeping missions of the United Nations and \\nregional organizations like the African Union in Mali, \\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, South \\nSudan and now in the Central African Republic. On the \\nAfrican continent, our credibility and our responsibility \\nto protect are at stake. Twenty years after the Rwandan \\ngenocide, indifference is no longer an option.\\n\\nI should now like to say a word about my own \\ncontinent, Europe. The crisis in Ukraine has step-by-\\nstep turned into a conflict — one that, unfortunately, \\nshows that the times when we thought peace on the \\nEuropean continent had become self-evident are over. \\nThe conflict has already cost the lives of more than \\n3,000 people. It must end and it must end now. Dialogue \\nand diplomacy are of the essence.\\n\\nFrom Syria to the Central African Republic, from \\nIraq to South Sudan, the list of war crimes and crimes \\nagainst humanity committed on a daily basis becomes \\nlonger each day. The perpetrators of those crimes, of \\ngrave violations and abuses of human rights, of violations \\nof international law and international humanitarian \\nlaw must be held accountable before justice for their \\nacts. The fight against impunity must cease to be an \\nabstract objective and become a tangible reality. The \\nInternational Criminal Court has an important role to \\nplay in that regard.\\n\\nWith regard to grave violations of international law \\nand war crimes, I would like to draw attention to the \\nviolations and atrocities committed against children. \\nChildren are often the first victims of armed conflicts: \\nthey are killed and maimed, they are abducted and \\nrecruited, and they are sexually abused. They are \\ndeprived of their right to education and health care. They \\nare cruelly denied access to humanitarian assistance.\\n\\nAs Chair of the Security Council Working Group on \\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Luxembourg is working \\nin a determined way to strengthen and to implement \\nfully the children and armed conflict agenda. We will \\n\\n\\ncontinue to do so beyond our tenure on the Security \\nCouncil. Children embody the hope and future of every \\nsociety. All together, we must do everything we can to \\nsafeguard that hope and future from the horrors of war. \\nWe cannot acquiesce to sacrificing future generations.\\n\\nThe fight against sexual violence calls for the same \\ncommitment. Sexual violence in conflict spares no one. \\nIt affects adults and children, women and men. We must \\nresolutely tackle this scourge.\\n\\nThe prevention of conflict is a core purpose of \\nthe Organization. Spotting early-warning signs of a \\nconflict is of crucial importance if we want to take the \\nmost effective measures at the right time, and if we \\nwant to prevent a situation from escalating into open \\nconflict. We know that most conflicts are preceded by a \\nsignificant deterioration in the human rights situation. \\nIt is on that basis that the Secretary-General launched \\nthe Rights Up Front initiative — rights before anything \\nelse. Its aim is to strengthen the capacity of the United \\nNations to act as a smoke detector before it is too late \\nto prevent the fire from spreading or, to continue that \\nmetaphor, to alert the fire brigade before the fire gets \\nout of control. Luxembourg welcomes that initiative. \\nIt is a forceful reminder of our collective obligation to \\nprotect and promote human rights. It rightly places the \\nprotection of human rights at the centre of the efforts \\nundertaken by the United Nations to prevent conflicts.\\n\\nTackling the root causes of conflict, poverty, \\ndiscrimination, the absence of the rule of law, to name \\njust those few, is part of the same preventive approach.\\n\\nHowever, I also have to recall that in certain \\ncountries, being different is not always accepted. The \\nrights of minorities must be respected. It is unacceptable \\nthat to this day, a religion or a sexual orientation, for \\nexample, prevents a person from living freely in certain \\nsocieties. Diversity is the richness of our society, it is \\nnot a crime.\\n\\nAs I address the Assembly, there are numerous \\nthreats to peace and security we must face that require \\na holistic response. I have already addressed terrorism \\nand our common struggle to eradicate that scourge. The \\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction constitutes \\nanother clear threat. The joint plan of action agreed \\nin Geneva on 24 November 2013 was an important \\nmilestone towards solving the Iranian nuclear issue. I \\nwould like to reiterate Luxembourg’s full support for \\nthe efforts of the EU 3+3 to arrive at a comprehensive \\nsettlement that restores trust in the exclusively peaceful \\npurpose of the Iranian nuclear programme. I urge Iran \\nto engage fully and in good faith in order to allow those \\ndiscussions to lead to the expected results as soon as \\npossible.\\n\\nIn Africa as well as in Latin America, small arms are \\nthe real weapons of mass destruction. The devastating \\nconsequences of the unregulated arms trade are well \\ndocumented. I am therefore particularly pleased that \\nthe Arms Trade Treaty, which was adopted last year by \\na very broad majority of the Assembly, will enter into \\nforce on 25 December. Luxembourg was honoured to \\nbe among the first States to sign and ratify it. It is our \\nfervent hope that we will be able to achieve our shared \\ngoal of making it a universal treaty.\\n\\nAlso along the lines of threats to international \\npeace and security, allow me to touch upon the serious \\ncrisis caused by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. \\nThis is not a simple humanitarian emergency, far \\nfrom it. It is a multidimensional crisis that threatens \\nthe institutions, societies and economies of the three \\ncountries affected by the outbreak — and the region \\nas a whole. It calls for mobilization at every level: \\nnational, regional and global. The Secretary-General \\nfully appreciates the magnitude of the challenge, and \\nwe wholeheartedly support the United Nations Mission \\nfor Ebola Emergency Response. There is no time to \\nlose. Beyond the contributions we have already made \\nto the World Health Organization, the World Food \\nProgramme, Doctors Without Borders and the Red \\nCross, we stand ready to do more, in close consultation \\nwith the countries of West Africa, many of which are \\nLuxembourg’s partners, as well as with the United \\nNations and civil society organizations on the ground.\\n\\nIn conclusion, allow me to return to the three \\nkeywords that guide our efforts: commitment, \\nsolidarity, responsibility. It was our eagerness to work \\nfor strong and effective multilateralism and our resolve \\nto serve the United Nations that motivated Luxembourg \\nto aspire to become a non-permanent member of the \\nSecurity Council, for the first time in its history, \\nfor the 2013-2014 term. During the past 20 months, \\nLuxembourg has worked hard every day to show that it \\nis up to that responsibility. It has worked hard to show \\nthat it is worthy of the honour bestowed upon it by the \\nGeneral Assembly when it was elected to the Security \\nCouncil. We carry out our mandate in the name of all \\nStates Members of the United Nations, and we are quite \\naware of that. Today, I would like to take this opportunity \\nto heartily thank the Assembly, in my personal capacity \\n\\n\\nand in the name of the Government of Luxembourg, for \\nthe trust placed in us. The Aseembly can rest assured \\nthat we will continue to serve the United Nations to \\nuphold our common values, the values of humankind.\\n', 'The United Nations was created, not to lead humankind to heaven but to save it from hell. These were the apt words of Mr. Dag Hammarskjöld, who served as the second Secretary-General, from 1953 to 1961, and saw things for what they were. The United Nations was created according to the people’s will 70 years ago, following the Second World War, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Today, in a world beset by armed conflict, violent extremism, radicalization and terrorism, in a world where war, persecution and violations of human rights force millions and millions of people — men, women and children — to leave their homes and to take to the road in mass exoduses in search of safety and dignity, the achievement of that goal seems far more urgent than ever.\\nThe choice of theme for the seventieth session of the General Assembly, “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, was\\n15-29658 39/55\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\\nwise indeed. As we have said many times from this rostrum, human rights and the rule of law are closely interconnected and one cannot exist without the other. I shall not revert again to the historic adoption of the post-2015 development agenda except to recall that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in San Francisco in June and commenting on the importance and scope of this universal programme, observed that we were the first generation that could put an end to poverty in the world and the last generation that could take action to prevent the worst consequences of a warming Earth.\\nThat observation should cause us to renew our commitment to a better future for all, to show solidarity, to unite our forces, pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations. As we did when we reached agreement on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must spare no effort to come together at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December, so that we can accept an ambitious and binding climate change agreement that applies to all countries and will keep the increase in global warming to below 2°C. As President of the European Council, Luxembourg will spare no effort to ensure that the Paris meeting will be a success. We must seize this historic opportunity.\\nAnother priority project during Luxembourg’s presidency of the Council in which I will invest all my energies is that of migration. According to the data of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, today there are 59.5 million displaced persons, including refugees, or more than at any time since 1945, at the end of the Second World War. As the Secretary- General noted, the continuous flow of migrants and the surge of human misery bring us face to face with our responsibilities as political leaders, as members of the international community and, obviously, as human beings.\\nIn times of crisis, unfortunately, various unilateral vague desires and nationalist or populist reflexes seem to reappear. We saw that happen again, tragically, in the summer. But no country can face the unprecedented crisis of migrants and refugees alone. Withdrawing into ourselves is not the answer. We must act together, as the countries of origin, transit and destination of migrants, and respond to the challenges posed by migrant movements in the Mediterranean, the Balkans\\nand elsewhere. Only if we firmly anchor our actions in respect for our international commitments, shall we find a solution worthy of our shared values, the values for which the United Nations and the European Union were founded.\\nAt the level of the European Union we took a first step during the past week by deciding to relocate within the countries of the Union 120,000 people who clearly need international protection. Other decisions will follow shortly. The European Union will respond to the urgent needs of refugees by donating at least an additional €1 billion to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and other such bodies. We will increase our assistance to Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis. We will help Western Balkan countries deal with the flow of refugees, including through pre-accession instruments.\\nWe cannot simply deal with the symptoms of the crisis. We must also tackle the root causes of migration and of refugee flows: development inequalities, especially in Africa; conflict and violence; the absence of the rule of law; persecution and violations of human rights; and impunity. That brings us back to the interconnectedness of security, development and respect for human rights and the need to adopt a comprehensive, integrated approach for the most effective application to development and migration of a combination of foreign policy, security, trade and cooperation instruments. The upcoming Valletta summit on migration on 11 and 12 November will provide an opportunity for us to discuss a comprehensive approach to the question of migration with our African partners, an opportunity which I welcome.\\nFor more than four years, Syria has been synonymous with war, violence and exodus. One in six Syrians has now fled the country. One out of two has had to leave home. Every day 9,500 persons are added to the list of displaced persons. Every minute a family is forced to abandon everything. A whole of generation of children has been exposed to war, violence and death and deprived of fundamental freedoms, protection and education. More than 220,000 people have lost their lives. Indiscriminate aerial bombing, the release of barrel bombs, the acts of violence and the violations of human rights and international law continue unabated. The sieges continue. The denial of assistance and the obstruction of humanitarian assistance persist. Crimes\\n40/55 15-29658\\n\\x0c\\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\\nagainst humanity and war crimes are committed every day with impunity.\\nThat cannot continue; it must be stopped. The situation is the Security Council’s responsibility and it is the responsibility of all of us. The solution to the Syrian conflict cannot be humanitarian, nor can it be military.\\nToday, the worst thing is the indiscriminate shelling in an undisciplined way and without prior coordination. The people are waiting for us to end the carnage rather than to make it worse.\\nA solution to the conflict can only be political. As we have said time and again, any lasting settlement requires a political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, in line with the Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522, annex). Words must be followed by actions. It is time for negotiations to finally begin. All of us must support Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura in his efforts. The fate of the Syrian people and the stability of Syria and of its neighbours within and beyond the region depend on it.\\nIn that context, I will say a word on the destructive barbarism of the terrorist group Daesh and the urgent need to combat it. The tragic current situation in Syria, Iraq and Libya, and its repercussions in Europe, demonstrates that the international community must work together to stop the advance of Daesh. The day before yesterday, my country participated in a summit meeting organized by President Obama, which was the continuation of a discussion held in the Security Council one year ago (see S/PV.7272). The Assembly can continue to count on our country’s support in combating Daesh and violent extremism, whether in terms of preventing radicalization, exchanging intelligence, countering the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters or taking measures against terrorist financing.\\nI must mention another tragedy at the heart of the tumult in the Middle East, which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The year 2015 was sadly emblematic of the impasse of the peace process, which, at present, is only that in name. In an environment characterized by a total lack of prospects and the continuing cycle of revenge, the idea that there might be an alternative to the two- State solution is beginning to gain public support and to be applied on the ground. During my travels in the region last month, I was able to see that development for myself. But it involves an illusion, and perhaps a\\nvery dangerous one. The two-State solution remains the only way forward. The conditions for that solution are obvious, both with respect to the 1967 borders and the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of the two States.\\nThe call to stop the settlements is not a matter of Israel-bashing, as it was described by the Prime Minister of Israel earlier today. Rather, it is a call to reason, to give the resumption of negotiations a chance. But to save the two-State solution, we must change our mindset. We must think outside the box. Now is no longer the time for efforts that lead nowhere. We must encourage a new negotiating format, broaden the circle of participants so that there is a greater involvement of Europe and especially of the Arab countries, reactivate the role of the Security Council and set a reasonable time frame within which to conclude the negotiations.\\nIsrael has the right to live in peace and security, but it is clear to me that Israel’s security in the long and medium term will depend on the creation of a sovereign and democratic State of Palestine, living alongside it. The two-State solution is the only solution that is just and moral for both parties. As of yesterday, the Palestinian flag began to fly beside those of the States Members of the Organization. Let us all work to make it become more than just a symbol.\\nThe comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, which the E3+3 and the European Union reached after several years of negotiations with Iran, demonstrates that we should not lose faith in the power of diplomacy, even when tackling the thorniest of issues. The international community has made considerable efforts in those negotiations with Iran, which also serve the security interests of Israel. Let us be less fatalistic. Israel’s right to exist is not affected by that agreement. In fact, the opposite is the case. We believe that the full and rigorous implementation of the Joint Plan of Action, adopted on 14 July, will mark a fundamental turning point for peace and security in the region.\\nWe could also say much more regarding other regions in the world, including Africa, as well as my own continent, Europe, where a conflict dating from another era started to affect Ukraine in February 2014 and is still ongoing. Thanks to substantial mediation efforts and commitment on the part of Germany, France and the European Union; thanks to close cooperation between regional and international organizations, first and foremost among them the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; and thanks to\\n15-29658 41/55\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\\nthe continuous monitoring of the United Nations, especially of the human rights situation in the Crimea and in eastern Ukraine, the foundations of a settlement of the crisis in Ukraine have been established in recent months. Commendable efforts have also been made with respect to regional autonomy and decentralization. The upcoming regional elections will be critical. It will be especially vital to hold them throughout the country and, therefore, in the Donbas region, under the authority of Ukrainian law. It is essential that each party fully respect the commitments entered into in the Minsk agreements.\\nWhen we talk of Ukraine, the Middle East, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Mali or Burkina Faso, there is one constant in all the situations, which is that diplomacy and the commitment to human rights and the rule of law must prevail, if we are to solve today’s profound crises. Our Secretary-General has fully risen to the challenge with the Human Rights Up Front initiative, firmly reminding us of our collective responsibility to protect and to place human rights at the centre of United Nations efforts to prevent conflict. To that end, all the actors and organs within the United Nations system must play their respective roles.\\nAllow me to focus on the particular role of the Security Council and its members. According to the Charter of the United Nations, the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security was conferred upon the Security Council to “ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations”. The paralysis of the Council, when populations are threatened with horrific crimes, runs counter to the spirit of the Charter. That is why we welcome and support the initiative launched by France aimed at ensuring that the permanent members of the Security Council refrain from using the right of veto in cases of mass atrocities.\\nBut beyond the permanent members, each of the Member States must assume its responsibility. Each one has its role to play, in working towards decisive action by the Security Council to prevent or halt mass atrocities. We therefore encourage all Member States to support the code of conduct as it relates to the action of the Security Council against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It will be officially launched on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. The same code of conduct has been developed by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, of which Luxembourg is a\\nmember. The responsibility to protect must cease to be an abstract principle and become a concrete reality.\\nAt 70 years of age, the United Nations must be able adapt in order to be up to the challenges it faces. On that account, we welcome the ongoing reviews that aim to make United Nations actions more efficient in its peacekeeping operations, peacebuilding or in the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which recognizes women’s indispensable role in peace and security. Luxembourg will continue to engage with the numerous Member States that wish to push forward a reform of the United Nations. I am obviously thinking, in particular, about a reform that would make the Security Council more effective, transparent and representative of today’s world.\\nLet me conclude my remarks as I began them, with a quotation. This one is from Mahatma Gandhi. I understand it as an exhortation and a reminder of the responsibilities that we must shoulder, if we want to realize the dream of the creators of our Organization, which is the dream of a world of peace and dignity for all and the dream of a better world: “You must be the change you wish to see in the world”.\\n', 'A predecessor of the President of the General Assembly at its first session, in 1946, was one of my compatriots, Mr. Paul-Henri Spaak. In the midst of the Second World War, he said that we must take advantage of the exceptional circumstances to seize the opportunity to make substantial progress in the world and to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. That was the objective of the founders of the United Nations 70 years ago.\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines fundamental human rights and universal values. All human beings are born free and equal. Freedom of thought, freedom of opinion and freedom of expression are intangible. Those freedoms are the foundation of a democratic world in which each individual’s dignity, no matter what his country, origin or culture, must be fully respected.\\nSince 1945, the world has changed and much progress has been realized. I am 40 years old. The challenges our generation faces are multiple, complex and increasingly interrelated — conflicts, poverty, climate and migration. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) should give new impetus and greater force to our joint action for development. As I said, I am 40 and was born well after the independence of the African States. My belief is that the destiny of Europe and Africa are inextricably linked. Everyone stands to gain from the success of others, but we can also lose much from failures. I have not known the period of colonization. I know only an Africa of free and independent African States, so I have no sense of nostalgia nor guilt. But I do have a feeling of responsibility. We must look clearly and optimistically to the future of the continent, to which my country is especially committed. We want a sincere and frank\\nrelationship of equals, a partnership in which everyone is fully respected and no one teaches the other lessons.\\nWith its more than 1 billion people, I am convinced that Africa will have an increasingly more important place in the world. We know the potential of the continent. Africa has the talent and Africa has the resources. I think first of the young Africans, who are full of vitality and ingenious and who want to take their destiny into their own hands. They have a feeling of dignity and freedom that nothing and nobody can stop.\\nThe primary condition for development is respect for the rule of law and the guarantee of personal freedom. The years 2015 and 2016 are election years in Africa. There can be no democracy without legitimacy, and there can be no legitimacy without respect for the constitutional agreements that unite the leaders with their peoples. Certain countries, such as Nigeria and Senegal, have demonstrated wisdom. But we can only condemn the coup d’état attempts, such as that which recently occurred in Burkina Faso. Ultimately, we must call on all Heads of State to fully respect the electoral cycles as set out by their Constitutions.\\nThe Charter of the United Nations enshrines the sovereignty of all States. Sovereignty first of all entails the primary responsibility of leading a country in the public interest. In no case can sovereignty it serve as a pretext for an oligarchy. Sovereignty involves duty to the people. Ignoring the people’s will or trampling on their freedoms will succeed only for a short period of time, because the people’s thirst for freedom and dignity will sooner or later win.\\nIn Burundi, we spared no effort to ensure respect for the Constitution and the Arusha agreements. The obstinacy to remain in power at whatever cost is a certain form of blindness that upsets the balance.\\nToday, unfortunately, the country is deeply divided, and it is Burundian citizens, many of them now refugees, who are the main victims. We would like to once again make an urgent appeal for a political dialogue between the Government and the opposition under the auspices of the countries of the region, within the framework of the East African Community.\\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a great country situated in the heart of Africa. It has a young, dynamic population and abundant natural resources, but also a history of tragic conflict for which its population has paid a terrible price for many years.\\n50/54 15-29562\\n\\x0c\\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19\\nRespect for the rule of law and constitutional order is the only road to stability. With elections in the offing, everyone is expecting the country’s political officials to demonstrate that they have the best interests of their country and people at heart.\\nMy country is also committed to working to improve both security and development in the Sahel region. Destabilization in Libya, explosive population growth and climate change have all resulted in serious problems, as we know. We want to continue to support peacekeeping operations in the Niger and Mali, as well as the efforts of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali.\\nAlong with official development assistance, we should encourage private initiative. Economic development must create jobs and produce more revenue for States. Improving the business climate and combating corruption will promote investment. We should also encourage innovative financing for development, such as, for example, the idea of an international tax on financial transactions.\\nWe are all dealing increasingly with the rise of terrorism, and my country has not been spared. Terrorists want to destroy our universal values, and they do it by striking down innocent victims indiscriminately. While we must mobilize all possible means against these new threats, it is the duty of democracies to fight fanatics with respect for the rule of law. It will not be easy, but we must keep a constant watch over the balance between the right to security and respect for individual liberties. We must mobilize our security forces, police and judicial authorities, but we should also, perhaps, rely more on local communities, religious and spiritual leaders and civil society. Since 2003, negotiations on an international convention on terrorism have been at a standstill. In that regard, I would like to urge that we put renewed effort into making that international convention on terrorism a reality as soon as possible, and in that way add to the means for taking action at our disposal.\\nOther speakers before me have also urged that we must work to resolve the conflicts in Libya, Iraq and Syria. To be clear, in Syria it is not a question for us of choosing between the fanatical barbarism of the Islamic State, on the one hand, or the tyranny and massacres of Bashar Al-Assad, on the other. We believe we must act in parallel, at once eradicating Daesh and at the same time forcing a political transition\\ntowards free and credible elections. Syria needs strong institutions and a legitimate Government. That is the only possible path to peace and stability. We advocate a comprehensive humanitarian and political approach, with the possibility of considering a military option conducted with respect for international law. We support the extraordinary commitment of Mr. Staffan de Mistura, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, to re-starting a dialogue between all the parties.\\nIt has to be said frankly that the situation in Libya is the result of a failure on the part of the international community, and it shows clearly that only a comprehensive approach makes sense. At present, extremist groups of all stripes are sowing terror, as the attacks attempting to undermine the democratic transition in Tunisia attest. Here, too, we fully support the United Nations efforts to promote a political dialogue.\\nWe see that conflict and war push populations to seek safety elsewhere, far from home. Today, 60 million people around the world are displaced and often risk their lives to flee conflict. Syria, sadly, is only one of the tragic examples of such situations. We should support the countries that have to deal most directly with the consequences of those conflicts — Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey — and I welcome the fact that the European Union has decided to mobilize €1 billion to support hosting refugees in those three countries.\\nIn the Middle East, the peace process is stalled. We believe the status quo is not an option. Raising the Palestinian flag here at the United Nations, as we hope to do, is of course a symbol, but it is not enough. More than ever, in our view, the objective should be recognition of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State, with full respect for Israel’s security. We have to tell it like it is — neither rockets nor illegal settlements can pave the way to that vital goal. Europe must work harder with all its partners, and it is in that spirit that Belgium supports France’s initiative to establish a contact group bringing together countries of goodwill.\\nThe Charter of the United Nations establishes the principle of sovereign equality. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country must be guaranteed absolutely. In that regard, we stand by Ukraine in upholding the principles and obligations of international law. The Minsk agreements must be fully implemented by all the parties.\\n15-29562 51/54\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.19 30/09/2015\\nI would like to conclude by pointing out that while of course peace and security will always continue to be our goals, and differences between countries will continue to exist, it is the duty of humankind and of the General Assembly to resolve emerging conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding, rather than guns and fanaticism. The peace agreement in Colombia, the Iranian nuclear agreement and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba show that dialogue and respect can produce concrete results. The international order must assume that everyone, regardless of origin, culture or religion, fully endorses our basic universal values. As President Obama put it so well only days ago in this very Hall, “You can jail your opponents, but you cannot imprison ideas” (A/70/PV.13, p. 11).\\nAs a Head of Government, I know the responsibility that lies on the shoulders of those who represent their people. And, like all those here, I know that everywhere in the world there are pitfalls, contradictions and tragedies. But, above all, the world is made up of women and men with dreams and hopes both for themselves and for those they love. The spirit of freedom, innovation, intelligence, ingenuity, respect and tolerance are the best weapons we have to overcome the challenges of this century together. I would like to end with the words of Paul-Henri Spaak, the first President of the General Assembly, who said during his presidency that between a perfect world and a better world, he chose the better world. We know that a perfect world is unattainable. But a better world depends only us. A better world demands courage, responsibility and solidarity. With that conviction, I wish to affirm here my country’s commitment to a better world.\\n', 'Our Organization, the United Nations, is celebrating its seventieth anniversary. Immense progress has been made since it was established as an institution entrusted with the task of maintaining peace, which it has managed to do so on many an occasion. Yet, 70 years later dramas and tragedies, conflicts and wars continue to unfold, and the world must yet once again rise up to significant challenges. Among those of today is the flight of hundreds of thousands — even millions — of refugees from the Middle East and Africa, seeking protection or simply to save their lives. Terrorism strikes at civilian populations and no country is immune from this scourge. There are also conflicts, such as that in\\nthe Middle East, that have remain unresolved for years and years, and that we all know could intensify at any moment.\\nIn the meantime, there are disasters: tsunamis, earthquakes, islands on the verge of disappearing, coastlines washed away, and glaciers melting. That is the reality of climate change.\\nFaced with such challenges, we must all must shoulder our responsibilities at our respective levels. France, in many domains, has never refused its cooperation. France wished to host the Climate Change Conference, no doubt because we were aware of that terrible failure at Copenhagen and felt that this time we needed to make a good decision, one that can be taken only by the entire international community.\\nSo in Paris, we must ask ourselves one question: is humankind capable of taking the decision to preserve life on the planet? Yes, that single question places us at a level that no one could ever imagine in our generation. Some will say, “But that can happen later, maybe at another conference”. I assure the Assembly here and I will say it quite plainly: if it does not happen in Paris, it will be too late for the world.\\nMatters have progressed well in recent months, and very strong declarations have been made by precisely those most responsible for global warming — the United States and China, which have made commitments that contribute to changing the current situation. Many calls have come from all continents, stressing the gravity and urgency of the situation and providing detailed testimony on what global warming is now, today. There are some countries that so far have been reluctant — here I am thinking of developing countries — and have asked themselves whether it is really useful to impose restrictions on themselves when the most developed countries have been free of such rules and obligations.\\nIf asked today for a prognosis, and I often am, I will say that nothing has been settled in regard to winning an accord in Paris — nothing. But at the same time, everything remains possible. I see three conditions that must be met for us to be able to say that the Paris Conference was truly successful, worthy of us and of what was entrusted to us when we were asked to host the Conference.\\nThe first condition is to be able to conclude a universal agreement applicable to all, one that is binding and differentiated so that everyone can do their own part, and not more. To date, 90 countries — half\\nof those sitting in the United Nations — have submitted their national contribution, which represents 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions — already a considerable figure. That means that half of the world has not yet responded. I therefore invite them to do so and to do so quickly so that we can determine as of now what, given the contributions from every State, we can assure the world will be the limit on global warming.\\nThe second condition that will signify our success or failure is to be able to ensure that our resolution, our action, is long-lasting. The Paris accord must not be an end or a conclusion, but rather a starting point, the beginning of a process. Through incorporating a review mechanism into the agreement, we will be able to regularly review, periodically measure and even revise every five years our national contributions. That is what will allow us to be sure that at the end of the century, well beyond our time, the planet will not havewarmed by more than 2°C.\\nThe third condition that will determine failure or success is developed countries making financial commitments. I am aware that already in Copenhagen the figure of $100 billion was announced to ensure the financing of energy transition, adaptation and technology transfer. We must collect $100 billion by 2020, but it must be said today so as to ensure that emerging countries, developing countries, can feel confident that they will be aided and supported so that this technological leap, the sharing of technology, will come about.\\nYes, one hundred billion dollars. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is responsible for providing an initial estimate, to be presented at the Lima meeting. I wish here to thank the President of Peru for continuing the work he undertook at the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The OECD will provide the initial estimate, as we have not reached $100 billion yet. So we have two months before the Paris Conference to continue to mobilize the World Bank, major development banks, financial institutions, States and private stakeholders so that we can reach $100 billion. Everyone should set an example. France abides by the rule that when serving as the host country; we must perform better than our guests, or at least as well as them.\\nI am announcing here today that France’s annual climate funding, which is €3 billion today, will be more than €5 billion in 2020. That increase in aid will\\nnot be merely through loans, but also in the form of grants, because it is with grants — funds transferred directly and that will not be reimbursed — that we can powerfully promote the adaptation of developing countries to the effects of climate change.\\nIn brief, if we are in a position to meet those three requirements — that is, a universal agreement, one that can be revised and will be revised every 5 years, and funding sufficient to cover everything that we will have to cover in emerging needs and future technology — then in Paris in two months we will be able to say we have risen to the challenge; not just a rendez-vous with history, but with the future.\\nIt is good that the international community is able to look to the future and to say what sort of world we want. We did it with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals, and we must do it for climate issues. But what is expected of the United Nations is not simply to ensure — though this is already considerable — that the world will be liveable at the end of the century, but that it is liveable today, when conflicts and wars confront us with tragedies that in 1945, when the United Nations system was founded, nobody imagined we would ever see again.\\nToday, it is Syria that once again calls on us to mobilize and to intervene, as many speakers have already stated. Everyone considers that this is a tragedy striking the Syrian population. Everyone has said that we must find a solution. Let us look for it together. But first, we should assess what has not been done.\\nThree years ago, when I stood at this rostrum to address the General Assembly (see A/67/PV.6), there had already been 30,000 victims of the Syrian tragedy. There are now 250,000, and 12,000 children have died, victims of the Bashar Al-Assad regime. The Syrian tragedy began with a revolution led by those who wanted to challenge the dictatorship of Bashar Al-Assad. At that time, there were no terrorists, there were no fundamentalist groups — there was a dictator who was massacring a people. And the refugees whom we are discussing today, the refugees in the camps, the displaced, 8 million of them — this mass of women, men and children — have not just fled a war. For more than three years they have been fleeing from the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. And still today that same regime is raining bombs on innocent civilians.\\nBut it is not because there is a terrorist group that itself massacres, kills, rapes, destroys — including\\ndestruction of the common heritage of humankind — that some form of pardon, of amnesty, should necessarily be accorded to the regime that created this situation, as if the existence of a terrorist group that commits the worst kinds of evil acts could furnish the regime with a way to share in what is good. No, all those women, men and children are victims of this tragedy, which is generated by the alliance between terrorism and dictatorship. No solution can be found outside of a political process.\\nFrance, which, due to its history and also its links that bind it to that part of the world, intends to shoulder its responsibilities. It has already done so recently, including through armed action, through force. France wants to work with everyone; it does not exclude any country — neighbouring countries, which are most affected, the Gulf countries, but also Iran, the permanent members of the Security Council, as well as Europeans. We want to work with everyone, with everyone who wants to work with us.\\nThere is talk of a coalition. This broad coalition is possible; it is even desirable and necessary in order to put an end to what is happening in Syria. But this coalition must have a clear basis or it will never see the light of day. The basis was provided in Geneva more than three years ago. And what did the Geneva agreement say? It specified a transitional Government with full powers, including members of the present Government and the opposition, formed on the basis of mutual consent. That is the basis; let us use it to move forward.\\nBut I can see, in the context of this ongoing adversity, that some are making every diplomatic effort to incorporate Bashar Al-Assad in that process. But one cannot make the victims and the executioner work together. Al-Assad is at the origin of the problem; he cannot be part of the solution. We have to put an end to the suffering of the Syrian people, but we must also look beyond the political transition that has to be sought, the broad coalition that has to be formed, this condition that has to be laid down, to a new Government capable of uniting all those who have fought, but without the dictator.\\nWe also have to be thinking about all the refugees. Until now, those refugees have been in neighbouring countries, but there too, the international community turned a blind eye because it was far away. Today those refugees, who can endure no more, are starting a long march. Yesterday, I recalled in the Assembly (see A/70/ PV.11) that 80 per cent of the world’s refugees — refugees\\nbecause of wars, conflicts, climate, poverty — are in the South. Solidarity with the South is coming from the South. Frequently, it is the most deprived who welcome the poorest. There comes a time when the refugees start to walk, and they can no longer be stopped. If we want to avoid what we have seen — tragedies, crossings that endanger the lives of passengers — if we want to prevent smugglers and criminals from using despair to further enrich the coffers of terrorism, then we must act.\\nEurope has hosted refugees coming not only from Syria, but also from Iraq, Eritrea and the Sudan. That was our duty, because Europe is based on values and principles, and the right to asylum is part of this common foundation that unites all the European countries, and which must continue uniting them. Otherwise, it is not the kind of Europe that we wanted.\\nBut while Europe should discharge its duty, the world must help refugees. What have we learned those past days and weeks? That the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), due to lack of funds, no longer has the resources to ensure the necessary support and assistance to the populations in question. What have we learned? That the World Food Programme no longer has the means to provide all the refugees basic necessities and sufficient food. What have we learned? That in some neighbouring countries, refugees could not work.\\nThis is the start of the cycle one would have imagined. If we want to reverse the flows, if we want to keep refugees as close as possible to their home countries, then we must fund UNHCR more, we must help neighbouring countries — Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey — but also countries in Africa, transit countries, countries where there is no migration. We need a major plan now, because tragedy is calling to act and to avert other tragedies. In that context, too, France is doing what it can, and must do what it should. And concerning the World Food Programme, France has decided to immediately increase by €100 million its support for United Nations agencies that are helping countries neighbouring Syria.\\nI want to end my speech by saying that the legitimacy of an Organization such as the United Nations rests on its credibility. If the United Nations does not have the capacity to resolve conflicts that have been going on for far too long, if the United Nations cannot resolve tragedies or ease the situation of civilian populations, then our helplessness will condemn us. If we want our\\nOrganization — which is celebrating its seventieth anniversary — to have a future worthy of that which the founders imagined, we cannot avoid reform of the United Nations.\\nFrance calls for the enlargement of the Security Council. France calls for a different representation in the Security Council. France calls for continents to clearly bear responsibility for the world in the framework of the Security Council. France wants the permanent members of the Security Council to no longer resort to the right of veto in cases of mass atrocities. How can we tolerate that the United Nations, even today, remains paralysed when the worst is unfolding? There again, let us lead by example. I pledge here today that France will never use its right of veto in matters involving mass atrocities. The right of veto as it was introduced when the United Nations was founded was not the right to block; it was the right to act. We have to act. We can act. We have been showing that we can for 70 years. Here, today, we can act to settle the tragedies of today and to save the planet tomorrow. Let us act.', 'Seventy years ago, the United Nations was founded as the collective answer to war and genocide, which had cost the lives of millions of people. The principal idea of the United Nations was to prevent war, to uphold respect for international law and human rights, and to promote social and economic progress.\\nI myself have not lived through even half of this period. Nevertheless, I believe that today, 70 years later, we all have to ask ourselves if we have really succeeded. We are facing a record high of over 50 violent conflicts, stretching from Syria and Iraq to Yemen, the Sudan and Somalia. We are facing a rise in radicalization and extremism. And we are facing the highest number of refugees since the Second World War. Nearly 60 million people worldwide are on the move as refugees or internally displaced persons. Four million of them are Syrians who have left their country, fleeing from civil war and terror. Every day over 40,000 people flee their homes in search of peace, security or a new life. This challenge is not limited to one region or to one continent. It is a global challenge. It concerns the Mediterranean region, but also South Asia and large parts of Africa.\\nEurope is currently also witnessing a huge flow of refugees, in particular from the wider Middle East. These global refugee flows pose serious problems for the countries of origin and transit, as well as for the countries of destination. But all affected countries and regions have one thing in common: no country and no region can solve this crisis alone, and no single measure can provide a solution. We need a comprehensive approach covering all the refugee routes, including the countries of origin, transit and destination. Which organization, if not the United Nations, can provide the basis for this collective action? Which organization, if not the United Nations, can contribute to this comprehensive approach?\\nIf we want to reduce the number of refugees, we have to focus our efforts on three key areas.\\nFirst, we have to confront the root causes in the countries of origin: civil wars and massive human rights violations and terrorism. In this context, we have to intensify our fight against Daesh and terrorist groups. They must be neutralized and defeated. In the case of Syria, it also means that we have to push harder for a closing of ranks in the region. We will be able to achieve meaningful progress only if major regional\\n48/55 15-29658\\n\\x0c\\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\\nplayers, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Iran, act in concert. And finally, it means that we have to bring all relevant parties to the Syrian civil war to the table, as United Nations Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura is trying to do. Let me be clear: that does not mean that the current political leadership of Syria can be part of a long-term solution. It has brought endless harm to the people of Syria. But if one wants to make peace, one does not talk only to one’s friends.\\nThe second point is that we need more unity at the international level. Huge efforts have already been made, but the United Nations and its Member States can and should do more. We will be able to make a difference only if we make it possible for the United States and Russia to pull in one direction. The Security Council has to demonstrate unity.\\nWe need a mandate not only for action against Daesh, but also for the protection of civilians. It should include the establishment of safe zones and buffer zones, which would increase people’s security and make access to humanitarian aid much easier. Action by the Security Council would also make it possible for many countries to have the opportunity to join in and offer their support. Our position is clear: Austria would stand ready to contribute to such a United Nations peace operation.\\nThirdly, we need a change of system. A system that allows only the fittest or those rich enough to pay the smugglers to reach a safe haven like Europe is wrong. The current system is in fact indirectly sponsoring smugglers. Since 2000 more than 24,000 migrants and refugees have died on their way to Europe. The pictures of refugees drowned in the Mediterranean Sea or suffocated in trucks will continue to haunt us. We therefore need a change of system. We need to create the possibility for refugees to apply for asylum in their countries of origin or neighbouring countries. The United Nations could help in the establishment of such reception and information centres, which would allow resettlement programmes to be introduced.\\nIn my opinion, trafficking in human beings is one of the worst crimes. We should consider systematic and large-scale smuggling a crime against humanity, so that the perpetrators can finally be brought to justice.\\nThere is another crisis area we should not forget about. Last year, like most of those present, I referred to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict as probably the most serious challenge to peace and security in Europe\\n(see A/69/PV.15). One year later, we still do not see enough positive development. The conflict is ongoing, the number of deaths has even increased, and the socioeconomic consequences are huge.\\nThere is only one way ahead: a peaceful settlement based on dialogue and negotiation. We must find a solution that provides for a free and stable Ukraine enjoying strong ties with both the European Union and the Russian Federation. In this respect the Minsk agreement is and remains the only option on the table. There is no alternative to implementing that agreement. All parties have to live up to their commitments. In that context, let me underline the crucial work the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is doing. The Special Monitoring Mission and the Trilateral Contact Group play a unique role for a peaceful settlement. The OSCE deserves our full support, and Austria will do its utmost to contribute to its work, especially during our OSCE chairmanship in 2017.\\nAll these conflicts show that 70 years after its establishment, we need the United Nations more than ever. However, in some areas the United Nations is pushed to its breaking point. It urgently needs to be reformed in order to be prepared for the future. Which is the way forward?\\nFirst, we have to remind ourselves of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter is and remains our backbone. Failure is guaranteed if we do not respect it.\\nSecondly, we have to look at the functioning of the main bodies. We need a Security Council that is united and can act swiftly. We therefore welcome the efforts to improve the Council’s work, and we support the initiatives to suspend the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. In order to be able to address global challenges, we all need a United Nations that is capable of taking action and a Security Council that is more representative, accountable and transparent.\\nWe highly value the fact that one of the headquarters of the United Nations is in Vienna, and we will continue to support it actively. We remain committed to act as a place for international dialogue, such as the Iran nuclear talks that took place in Vienna this year.\\nWe will also continue to contribute to all diplomatic initiatives for a better world. In this sense, one key area for us is nuclear disarmament. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\\n15-29658 49/55\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\\nNuclear Weapons last May failed to reach an agreement, but there is growing international momentum on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. At that Conference, I delivered a joint statement on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons on behalf of 159 States. And the Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons last December resulted in a humanitarian pledge, which has been endorsed by 116 States. Austria, together with other sponsors, will submit several draft resolutions on the humanitarian initiative, and we hope that they will receive broad support.\\nSeventy years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons still pose one of the most serious threats to humankind. I can assure the Assembly that Austria will fight for a world free of nuclear weapons to make our world a safer place.\\nThe global challenges we are facing require a strong United Nations. We therefore thank Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for all his work. I can assure the Assembly that Austria will remain committed to the United Nations and to our Secretary-General. They can continue to count on our continuous support.\\n', 'It is a privilege to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a Kingdom made up of four autonomous countries — the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao and Saint Maarten — rooted in both Europe and the Caribbean.\\nIn 1945, the Charter of the United Nations was signed by representatives of 51 countries. Today, 70 years later, there are three times as many people on the Earth and four times as many Member States, with all the complexities that that entails. And yet, as an international Organization, the United Nations stands proud. In those 70 years, the world has seen great upheavals and shifts in the balance of power. Technological advances have changed our daily lives faster and more dramatically than ever before, and yet, the United Nations endures. We have seen clashes of interests, bitter conflicts and human tragedies, which, indeed, persist today. As we speak, the lives of millions are still dominated by fear, oppression and want. And yet, the United Nations lives on as a legitimate platform for international dialogue where countries can always come together, no matter how great their differences.\\nThe United Nations is more than simply a platform. It is an Organization whose activities help to shape and improve our world. Thanks in part to the United Nations, extreme poverty has been halved, child mortality has been halved, 2.3 billion people have gained access to drinking water, diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have been beaten back, and peace operations in many areas have brought violent conflicts under control. That is all because of the\\nwork of millions of courageous people in the Member States and the untiring efforts of the staff of the United Nations and its organs, both here in New York and all over the world. So I would like to say to the United Nations: congratulations! I thank it for 70 years of battling against cynicism and fatalism.\\nFor the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United Nations is and will remain the primary global Organization for peace, justice and development. That is why the Kingdom is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term.\\nOf course, the world is far from perfect. It is still filled with terrible injustice and human suffering. But we have also made great progress. What would today’s world look like without the United Nations? There can be no doubt that we would be worse off. The Kingdom of the Netherlands feels a close bond with the fundamentals of the United Nations, as laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. We understand the value of diversity and dialogue. This goes hand in hand with the conviction that multilateral cooperation can help us move forward and make the world stronger.\\nWe owe our freedom to other countries. Seventy years ago our allies made enormous sacrifices in liberating the Netherlands. They enabled us to rise again and become a prosperous Kingdom. We will never forget the importance of international solidarity. The world will always be able to count on the Netherlands as a partner for peace, justice and development.\\nYet, just as we remain deeply committed, we also believe in being critical when necessary. It is good, on this seventieth anniversary, for the United Nations to look openly and honestly at the results of its efforts, to look at the goals that have not been achieved and at the long and winding path that lies ahead. Our Kingdom is gravely concerned about the lawlessness, terror and contempt for basic human rights that are gaining ground in some areas. Millions of desperate people have been displaced and forced to flee the violence. They are the innocent victims of intolerance and of despicable conduct on the part of tyrants they cannot constrain. Many refugees have been in a desperate situation for too long. The positive effects of years of work on sustainable development are at risk, and this affects us all. We cannot look the other way.\\nWe are all deeply touched by the tragic images of families who have had to leave everything behind in their search for a safe haven. All the world’s nations\\nmust show solidarity in the face of the refugee crisis. The Kingdom of the Netherlands has again increased its contribution to humanitarian assistance, making it one of the largest donors in the world. We call on other nations to follow suit and give additional support to the United Nations, so that it can provide food and shelter to all those who have been forced to flee and give them a chance to rebuild their lives.\\nIt is crucial that we make our joint efforts on peace and security more efficient and effective. The review by the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations is a helpful tool in that regard.\\nSince the United Nations was founded, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has participated in 63 United Nations or United Nations-mandated missions in more than 30 countries. Those missions have involved more than 125,000 Dutch military and civilian personnel. Earlier this year, I visited the Dutch men and women who are part of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. The situation there clearly illustrates how complex the problems in conflict areas often are. You cannot build lasting peace by military means alone. A political solution has to be found. It is equally important to strengthen the institutions that safeguard respect for the rule of law and to remove the underlying causes of conflict.\\nThe lack of decent prospects or equal opportunities drives many young people into the arms of ruthless terrorist organizations. Discrimination and exclusion are the root of much evil in the world. That is why we need a three-dimensional approach: a combination of defence, development and diplomacy, of which the Netherlands has many years of experience. For example, we have made it a top priority to stimulate job creation in Africa and to assist young African entrepreneurs, and we are increasing our support for programmes to promote stability in fragile States.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands is proud to be home to the International Court of Justice, the only principal organ of the United Nations located outside New York. The Hague is the place where global peace, justice and security are defended by a range of international organizations, including the International Criminal Court and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\\nA key feature of a legal order is the absence of impunity. Violence must never be allowed to prevail. Lawlessness must never become the norm. Anyone\\nwho strives for justice will find our Kingdom on their side. Injustice hurts like an open wound. Hundreds of families from 10 countries, including Malaysia, Australia and the Netherlands, still grieve every day for the loved ones they lost in the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 air disaster. They await the results of Security Council resolution 2166 (2014). That resolution is very clear: it demands that those responsible for this incident be held to account and that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. The Dutch Government will work tirelessly, together with all the countries and organizations concerned, until justice is done with regard to this tragedy.\\nPeace, justice and development are closely linked. They are a trinity, as tied to each other as the blades on a windmill. To achieve lasting progress, all three are essential. So our Kingdom welcomes the Sustainable Development Goals, which will focus the efforts of the international community over the next 15 years. And we will put our hearts and souls into helping ensure their success.\\nThere is still not enough focus on the positive role that women can play. Even in the harshest and most hopeless circumstances, women often have the strength to go on and to find practical ways to improve the lives of their families and communities. Promoting equal rights and opportunities for women is actually sustainable development in action. Any organization that wants to remain relevant must adapt to new times and circumstances. It is especially important for institutions that stand for shared values and continuity to critically examine their own performance and to ask themselves: “Are our working methods still appropriate?” Without such self-reflection they risk the gradual erosion of their relevance and effectiveness.\\nFor the United Nations and the Security Council this has, after 70 years, become an urgent issue. The Security Council needs to be able to act more boldly in the face of large-scale atrocities. Greater restraint in the use of vetoes would help. We warmly welcome France’s initiative in that regard. The Council’s legitimacy is also under pressure. If part of the global population feels insufficiently represented by it, the Security Council cannot properly fulfil its primary role as a global body for safeguarding peace and security and for resolving conflicts. Africa, in particular, is underrepresented, but the voices of other regions and countries are not being heard enough either. This needs to change.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands believes in the power of empathy and dialogue. It is not always the loudest voices that speak the deepest truths. In fact, it is often the small Member States that show us the way forward. One example is the longtime plea by small island States for a far more active global approach to climate change and marine pollution. They feel the urgency like no other. Fortunately — finally — more and more large countries are developing concrete action plans.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands knows how crucial this is. Three of our countries — Aruba, Curaçao and Saint Maarten — are small island States, and three other Caribbean islands are special municipalities of the Netherlands. With its centuries of water-management experience, the Netherlands is one of the best-protected deltas in the world, investing billions to help mitigate the effects of climate change. That is why we intend to make sure our voice is heard at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris later this year, and we will continue pressing for cleaner oceans.\\nOur guiding principle is simple — consider the interests of all countries, large and small. Forget might is right. We believe right is might. This also forms the basis of our candidacy for a seat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term. We are passionate about serving the entire international community at the United Nations level as a partner for peace, justice and development.\\nFor my wife and me, this has a very personal significance. For seven years I had the honour of being the Chair of the Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation. My wife remains his Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development. Two years ago, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke at the centennial celebrations of the Peace Palace in The Hague. He said, “Here in The Hague, you help sustain and expand the rule of law. You bring the rule of law to life.” We took those warm words not merely as a great compliment, but also as an inspirational challenge, a solemn task, which we aim to continue fulfilling, together with all Member States in The Hague, in New York and all over the world.', 'On the ruins of a world ravaged by the Second World War, 51 countries decided to give humankind a forum for voicing opinions again and came together to proclaim the values enshrined in the Charter: dignity, human rights, equality, justice, tolerance and peace.\\nIt is fitting that we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of our Organization, which has achieved so much. It would be difficult to imagine a world without the United Nations. It has contributed to reducing poverty in a great many countries, and it has achieved its primary goal: our generation is the first one not to have lived through a world war. However, if we wish to make an honest assessment we also need to be critical.\\nToday, close to 120,000 soldiers are currently active in United Nations peacekeeping missions. That means that the crises and the wars which ravage the world are still far too many in number. Today we have 60 million displaced persons worldwide, which is more than at any time since the United Nations was founded. Not only have we not made sufficient progress when tackling certain problems, but we have created new ones ourselves, such as global warming.\\nEven though we might not like to admit this, we must recognize that our behaviour continues to be marked by major inconsistencies. I should like to offer two examples of that. First, many countries continue to live in abject poverty when they have a wealth of natural resources. Secondly, we are concerned about movements of mass migration, yet, by causing global\\nwarming, we are depriving entire populations of the basic conditions they need in order to remain where they are.\\nLet us ask ourselves why so many educated young people wish to leave their own countries. This concerns not only developing countries but also a considerable number of European States as well. We must acknowledge that we have not yet succeeded in achieving anything close to a fair global distribution of wealth, nor have we succeeded in establishing the rule of law as the norm. Corruption remains endemic.\\nWe have to admit that we have not yet succeeded in combining growth with the protection of our environment. Furthermore, all too often national interests impede the formulation of joint responses. I am thinking here specifically of the refugee crisis in the Middle East and in Europe. Faced with such major flows of migrants, the solutions can only be joint ones. If we each continue to look after our own interests, we will all lose out in the end — the migrants will lose out, and the solidarity between States will fall by the wayside. If we fail to protect human dignity, we do ourselves a disservice, because to betray one’s own values is to betray oneself. I say once again, therefore, that the refugee crises require responses based on solidarity.\\nOne cannot ask Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon to take in all the refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. These countries have already done so much, such admirable work, which has received too little recognition thus far. Similarly, it is not possible to ask a few European countries to take in all of the refugees. We will all be judged on how we respond to this traumatic humanitarian challenge.\\nHere we face yet another inconsistency. If countries seek answers to such large-scale phenomena as the current migration movements in an individualistic way, without coordinating, everything will be brought to a standstill. Human beings are not free from inconsistencies, none of us are. To some extent at least, that is part of human nature. However, when it comes to the actions of Governments, States and communities of States, we must strive to minimize such inconsistencies. As we all know, in order to address poverty, the challenges of migration, conflicts, terrorism, organized crime and climate change, collective action is vital.\\nThe United Nations is more necessary than ever. What we require is a strong United Nations for a better world. To that end, we need to focus on three priorities.\\nThe ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) that we have just adopted is a huge step forward. We need to continue to impart this momentum by achieving an ambitious agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris.\\nAs for the peace and security pillar, it affords us an opportunity to strengthen the United Nations, especially with regard to the protection of the civilian population. Switzerland is convinced that one cannot resolve a conflict through a purely military approach. The United Nations must base each of its actions on a political strategy aimed at finding a lasting solution to the conflict. That self-evident truth was apparent during the various peace and dialogue processes conducted in Geneva on Syria, Libya, Iran and Yemen.\\nAs for the review of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), Switzerland will continue its effort to promote the participation of women in peace processes. We must also grant women more responsibility when it comes to security-related issues. Their involvement contributes to the duribility of peace agreements by expanding the agenda of negotiations and by improving the population’s commitment to such agreements.\\nThe United Nations will review its global counter- terrorism strategy during the summer of 2016. The implementation of this strategy is a priority for Switzerland, especially the parts relating to terrorism prevention and respect for human rights and international humanitarian law.\\nFinally, Switzerland is also convinced that a strong United Nations is a United Nations capable of taking action and decisions when international peace and security are under threat. In this connection, we reiterate our long-standing call to the members of the Security Council not to block or vote against any resolution aimed at preventing or putting an end to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.\\nHuman rights are the third pillar of the United Nations. Here, Switzerland is proud to be seeking election to the Human Rights Council for the 2016-2018 term. Switzerland’s priorities on human rights are the\\nabolition of the death penalty, the implementation of the prohibition of torture, the promotion of women’s and children’s rights, and the protection of human rights defenders. It is also essential that the perpetrators of human rights violations be brought to justice. Switzerland here wishes to recall the important role played by the International Criminal Court in the fight against impunity.\\nAs far as the humanitarian system is concerned, it has clearly reached its limits as a result of the growing number, longer duration and increasing complexity of crises. So far this year, 82 million people have required immediate humanitarian assistance. That is an unprecedented number. The World Humanitarian Summit, which is to be held in Istanbul in May 2016, will afford us an opportunity to improve the efficiency of the humanitarian system in order to enable it to better and more effectively respond to victims’ needs.\\nIn December, Geneva will host the thirty-second International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. That will be an important opportunity to make progress towards the creation of an institutional framework in which to discuss how we can improve compliance with international humanitarian law.\\nLet us continue to work together to build a modern and effective United Nations by reforming its governance. In this context, Geneva, as one of the main centres of global governance, has an essential role to play. The United Nations can count on the full support of my country, Switzerland, to strengthen it during the next 70 years.', 'The founding of the United Nations 70 years ago cast light on the dark twentieth century. That was a pivotal moment for our world. It came not against a backdrop of glorious sunshine and green pastures, but amid the ruins of the Second World War with its more than 50 million graves. As the winter of the Cold War spread its frosty fingers, the mothers and fathers of the United Nations forged the foundations of a new order — an order that is not perfect, and which may never be perfect, but which has often enough protected us from relapse into the old barbarism.\\nToday, 70 years on, it is clear that we are again living in turbulent times. Millions of people are gravely affected by wars and violence, and more than 60 million people have fled their homes — more than at any time since the end of the Second World War.\\nThe foundations of the United Nations are still strong, but the world order built on them has come loose from its moorings. The old balance of power is under pressure. Powerful new players have emerged on the world stage. Most serious of all, non-State actors are now increasingly responsible for war and violence. They abide by no rules — not even the minimum standards enshrined in the international law of war.\\nWe therefore urgently need new buttresses and pillars so that the order based on the United Nations can withstand the tempests of our times. What form could these new pillars take? How should the world order of tomorrow look?\\nI do not think that there is a theoretical answer to that question; the only answer is a practical one. Just as the Charter of the United Nations was adopted as a bold response to war and suffering, today new pillars will be built only if States are ready to assume responsibility and work together to find concrete answers to the crises of our times — to poverty and underdevelopment, to refugees and migration, to the devastating civil war in Syria and the failing States across the arc of crisis from Libya to Afghanistan, to religious extremism and terrorism and the murderous deeds of the people who call themselves the Islamic State.\\nThere is, however, one major difference between now and the situation 70 years ago. The world of today\\n15-29658 37/55\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\\nis more closely interconnected than ever before. Borders are becoming blurred. In this age of globalization, some say, the world has become a village. If that is so, then we are all neighbours, and I would advise us to act as good neighbours. We come from very different backgrounds. We have different traditions, religions, values and world views. That diversity must be respected. No world view takes precedence over any other, but I can think of no culture in which people are unaware of what it means to be a good neighbour and in which people do not appreciate living in an atmosphere of good-neighbourliness.\\nNobody is investing as much hope in that spirit of good-neighbourliness today than the millions of women, men and children who have fled their homes. My country has assumed its responsibility towards them over the past months. Since the beginning of the year, we have taken in 600,000 refugees. Currently, upwards of 10,000 new refugees are arriving every day. Those statistics show that even we cannot absorb such numbers by ourselves over the long term. We need to arrive at a European solution, together with our European neighbours, as well as with our neighbours around the Mediterranean, especially Turkey.\\nSecondly, the relief agencies of the United Nations system — the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs — all help people in need, on the spot and with no intermediaries. It is scandalous that those organizations are underfunded to the point that they have to cut food rations and medical aid. Accordingly, I met with the members of the Group of Seven and other partners the day before yesterday, and I am delighted to report that together we have raised an additional $1.8 billion, of which over $100 million will come from Germany, intended for the United Nations relief agencies. That will also help relieve the burden on the neighbouring countries in which the huge majority of refugees arrive, especially Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They too need our help, so that one exodus does not trigger another.\\nBut good-neighbourliness comprises more than just humanity and compassion. Good-neighbourliness also presupposes that we agree on joint rules that we all must obey. They include respecting each other’s borders and sovereignty. That fundamental norm is still being violated, even in Europe. The European\\nUnion unanimously condemned Russia’s annexation of the Crimea and the actions in eastern Ukraine, and we responded, not only in terms of condemnation and isolation, but also by launching a political process to defuse the conflict. The Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) has played an indispensable role in that process from the outset. We want to further strengthen the OSCE as an institution for our common security when we Germans assume its chairmanship next year.\\nActive political responsibility is also part and parcel of good-neighbourliness. A neighbourhood in which nobody looks beyond their garden gate will not be worth living in for long. People must be vigilant, because there are many conflicts that can only be solved in concert and by means of multilateral diplomacy. While that may take time and perseverance, it works.\\nThis past summer, the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany concluded an agreement with Iran. After more than 10 years of negotiations, we managed to agree that Iran will never have an atomic bomb and that we can verify this. The negotiations succeeded in bringing a number of actors to the same table, including Russia and the United States of America. The negotiations have therefore proved that while neighbours may not like one another, they can still solve problems together. Indeed they must do so, if living side by side is not to become unbearable for them both.\\nThe agreement that was reached has created common ground on which greater security can be established in the Middle East, if we persevere in our joint efforts. However, the realities are still somewhat different. In Syria, in the fifth year of the war, the slaughter knows no end. We will only put an end to it by acting together. We have to halt the brutality of Al-Assad’s dictatorship, as evinced by its use of barrel bombs and torture. We have to break the control of the Islamic State. We have to silence the guns in Syria and provide the people who live there with access to humanitarian aid.\\nMoreover, we also share the commons goals of preserving the territorial integrity of Syria and restoring conditions in which all ethnic and religious groups can live in peace with each other, as well as in peace with neighbouring countries. Those are goals that all the actors must believe in, whatever differences may exist between the United States of America and Russia or between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\\n38/55 15-29658\\n\\x0c\\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\\nWe already have a basis for joint action aimed at achieving those goals, as illustrated by Security Council resolution 2139 (2014). We must now implement it together with all the stakeholders as a first step towards defusing the conflict. I appeal to the stakeholders in Syria and Syria’s neighbours — but not only to them. Instead of multilateral decisions, such as those recently taken by Russia, regarding military action in Syria, we need Russia to now take political action that will advocate transition in Syria. That would be an important contribution to ending the stalemate. For that stalemate is a lethal one, which claims new lives every day.\\nAt the risk of repeating myself, let me stress that when dealing with a humanitarian catastrophe as horrifying as the one in Syria, we are all neighbours. That is what must prompt us to crawl out of our diplomatic trenches, for there can be no military solution. Neither supposed eternal truths nor national interests must be allowed to obstruct efforts to take the first steps in defusing the conflict in Syria.\\nIn these turbulent times, the idea of universal good- neighbourliness would be no more than a dream if there were not already an umbrella, a roof, under which universal good-neighbourliness has been practised for decades. Today we need the United Nations more than ever. We need a legitimate and responsive United Nations, and that is why Germany is campaigning for the reform of the United Nations and the Security Council. That is why we are working with others on the major global projects, on the ambitious 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1), which has just been adopted and on the equally, if not more, ambitious goals to combat climate change, which we hope to adopt together at the Conference of the Parties in Paris this December.\\nThe United Nations provides a framework, a roof, for our global endeavours. But under that roof, the work must continue at many levels. We Germans believe, first, that the way forward lies in regional cooperation in the European Union and the OSCE and in cooperation with other regional organizations, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the African Union, among others. Secondly, we are committed to re-establishing and stabilizing State structures across the arc of crisis from Libya to Iraq and Afghanistan. And thirdly, especially in our capacity as President of the Human Rights Council, we are championing the fundamental importance of human rights. For no political order can endure if the people are not secure in their rights.\\nIn conclusion, I would like to return to the founding of the United Nations 70 years ago. As magnificent as that moment was, it also inspires a sense of great humility in me as a German, because the Charter of the United Nations was part of humankind’s response to the war and inhumanity that had originated in my country. In the seven decades that have passed since that time, Germany has been fortunate enough to be gradually and cautiously welcomed back into the heart of the international community. For that, we Germans are grateful, but we are also aware of our responsibility. When Mr. Willy Brandt became the Federal Chancellor of Germany in 1969, he said that we Germans want to be a people of good neighbours. At the time, Germany was still divided, and those words were meant as a gesture of reconciliation towards Poland, France and the other European neighbours that had suffered greatly at German hands.\\nToday, when a Syrian family in Berlin tells me their tale of war and expulsion, Mr. Brandt’s words take on a new meaning. Now the world has become smaller, but the crises are no fewer. It is time for us to once again reaffirm that we Germans want to be a people of good neighbours to others near and far.\\n', 'May I first of all congratulate Mr. Thompson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I wish also to take this opportunity to thank his predecessor, whose outstanding work enabled us to modernize and render more transparent an entire series of processes, including that leading to the selection of future Secretaries-General of our Organization.\\nI also wish to commend the exemplary commitment of our Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, as his mandate and his decade of service to our Organization draws to a close. He has rightly stated, as fact and as an imperative, that we are the first generation that can put an end to poverty, and we are the last generation that can act so as to avoid the repercussions of unbridled climate change.\\nA year ago virtually to this day, we adopted, in this very Hall, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Today we must implement this ambitious universal programme and maintain the 2015 momentum. I therefore welcome the selection of the theme “The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world” for this session of the Assembly. We must work to ensure that no one is left behind and that we can all can reap the benefits of sustainable, just and equitable development. The year 2015 was also marked by the adoption of the Paris Agreement, which Luxembourg strongly committed to during its presidency of the Council of the European Union.\\nThe time has come to implement these international agreements and to ensure that the commitments that we have made internationally and nationally bear fruit. We must chart a course to a sustainable future for coming generations.\\nLuxembourg is actively working to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and will be among those States ratifying the Paris Agreement at the end of the year. We must act in an inclusive manner, involving the various stakeholders and ensuring that our policies are consistent, particularly in the area of development, so that we can strike a balance between the economic, environmental and social pillars.\\nWe must invest in education and health care. We must fight social inequality, ensure decent work for all and provide robust social protection systems.\\nMy country is among the seven countries that spend at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income on official development assistance; this has been the case since 2000. Official development assistance has an important rolе to play, but we must also mobilize other sources of funding. Faced with the relative decline in financial resources for development and humanitarian action, it is more urgent than ever to broaden the donor base.\\nThe first World Humanitarian Summit, in which I had the honour to take part last May in Istanbul, made it possible to reassert the principles governing humanitarian action: humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. As a signatory to the grand bargain, Luxembourg will seek to increase the predictability and effectiveness of its humanitarian contributions through multi-year agreements. We also intend to strengthen aid by allocating 5 per cent of funding directly to local organizations by 2020.\\nSharing, giving and helping are not words we hear much among many of my constituents these days. But are we aware of how fortunate we are? While in our country some parents must decide only if the dinner they will serve their children will be hot or cold, in other countries the question is, when will I be able to give my children some food?\\nThe high-level meeting held earlier this week reminded us that the challenge posed by mass movements of refugees and migrants in recent months and years can be addressed only globally. In the second half of 2015, my country held the presidency of the Council of European Union. Migration was, unfortunately, at the centre of our concerns during the presidency. Personally, I have learned a few lessons from that experience. On the European level, solidarity and burden-sharing are also indispensable to a credible migration policy that includes border controls or respects the Dublin Regulation.\\nIt is necessary to clearly distinguish between refugees in need of protection and irregular economic migrants. Most of the refugees in need of international protection have had to flee situations of war, sometimes, as in the case of Syria, through mass exoduses. The role of our Organization is crucial in conflict prevention, peacebuilding, peacekeeping and the responsibility to protect civilian populations.\\nA large part of the migration towards European countries is also economic. One cannot treat with contempt those who, for themselves or for their loved ones, often embark on a long and dangerous journey. We cannot fail to welcome them, but it is difficult to accommodate all of them. At stake, as we know very well today, is the acceptance of our opinions. Populism is being nourished by the feeling that matters are not under control. Some people profit from the confused situation by exploiting it for their own purposes. When I hear, as I did again this week, a political candidate say that a refugee may be a terrorist, I condemn such statements in the firmest possible terms. That is because a person who has left his country is a victim of terrorism, not a perpetrator.\\nI believe that we need to keep the paths of legal migration open, not merely because developed countries, notably those in Europe, need them, but also because it would be mistaken and dangerous to declare an end to all migration. Migration, when it is controlled, can constitute an opportunity for everyone. We must, I think, provide sufficient development opportunities to avoid disorderly movements. The approach adopted at the European Union-Africa summit, held in Valletta in 2015, seems to me to be a good one. Europe has committed itself to strengthening assistance to its African partners with increased cooperation on migratory flows at the borders. In the view of my country, it is an additional effort and not challenging to the existing models of cooperation and assistance.\\nBut what has happened since the Valletta Summit? The meetings provided an opportunity for dialogue, but it is essential to honour the commitments and to act. I think that the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on 19 September can help to deal with all those problems at an appropriate level: on the global level of our Organization. The population displacement has affected all regions of the world. It also affects those countries that are experiencing precarious situations for their own populations. As the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) invites us to do, we will actively participate in the work for the adoption in 2018 of a global compact on refugees and a global compact for safe, regular and orderly migration.\\nArmed conflict, the proliferation of weapons, the lack of development, violent extremism, radicalization and terrorism, threats posed by climate change, poor governance and violations of human rights continue to dominate the daily news. Terrorist attacks have shaken the Middle East and Africa, Europe, the United States and Asia. The effects of climate change manifest themselves in increasingly extreme weather patterns that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable States and populations, creating tension and unrest and pushing people to migrate to places they hope will be more clement. Armed conflicts persist or are likely to break out, endangering the survival of thousands of civilians, exposing them to violence, including sexual violence, and threatening their most basic rights.\\nThe African continent remains particularly vulnerable to both internal and external challenges and shocks. I do not wish to recite a litany of ongoing or potential crises. Rather than give a gloomy account of current events, I want to comment on the remarkable development potential of the African continent. I am persuaded that, together, we can act so that peace can become a reality in South Sudan, Somalia, Libya and the Central African Republic. It is up to the parties to those conflicts to bring about their settlement, thereby reducing the suffering of the population and paving the way for sustainable development. The international community is ready to assist and support their efforts for the restoration and consolidation of peace.\\nAfrica has formidable resources. In the first place, it has a pool of extraordinary talent represented by its youth. It is important to focus on education, health and job creation in the context of inclusive national development policies that make use of the human potential and natural resources of Africa. Such policies should aim to reduce poverty and inequality, reduce vulnerability to shocks and create countless prospects for the development and flourishing of the peoples.\\nAfrica is a continent to which my country, Luxembourg, feels close because of strong ties developed over many years as a result of our development cooperation policy. That partnership is a work in progress and aims to meet the needs of the African countries. Its focus has become increasingly economic, in complement to efforts hitherto concentrated on social sectors.\\nThe United Nations remains the place the international community chooses as the forum for addressing the many multidimensional crises and challenges our planet faces today. That is true of sustainable development. It is also the case in regard to combating terrorism. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy has established a political framework to combat terrorism while respecting human rights and individual freedoms. In that context, we welcome the Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.\\nWe all must also open the eyes of some young people who in their past behaviour showed no such tendencies yet tomorrow want to fight against their own families. For what reason? Because of religion? Absolutely not. They flout and abuse Islam. They kill their own brothers and sisters. We must condemn such behaviour. No religion can condone such savagery. It is important to remind those young people that no reward awaits them. All they are doing is injuring their own religion.\\nThe United Nations also plays a vital role in the maintenance of international peace and security, and a particular role is reserved for the Security Council. All too often, regrettably, the United Nations acts too late when a crisis has already erupted. We firmly endorse efforts to prevent crises or to avoid the recurrence of conflicts.\\nLuxembourg strongly supports the Secretary- General’s Human Rights Up Front initiative. Massive violations of human rights are often the first signs of a crisis about to worsen. Since its establishment in 2005, we have played an active part in the work and discussions of the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission, and we support the Peacebuilding Fund. The policy guidance and financial support provided by those entities have often been crucial in preventing the relapse of post-conflict countries into conflict, and they contribute to peacebuilding.\\nThe adoption by the General Assembly and the Security Council this year of almost identical resolutions to bring about sustainable peace represents a paradigm shift. The resolutions put conflict prevention at the very heart of United Nations action, in line with the Charter of the United Nations, which highlights the need to take effective collective measures to prevent and avert threats to peace.\\nLuxembourg fully subscribes to the idea of moving from a post-conflict peacebuilding approach to one of sustaining peace. That includes activities aimed at preventing the outbreak, continuation or recurrence of a conflict, addressing the root causes and ensuring national reconciliation with a view to reconstruction and development. Such an approach, resolutely political, integrates the three pillars of action of the United Nations — human rights, peace and security, and development. It is inclusive and is characterized by national ownership of efforts to sustain peace, in conformity with the wishes of all members of society and with the ongoing support of the international community. We must turn these words into deeds. The General Assembly can count on Luxembourg in that regard.\\nIf there is a conflict that should require us to redouble our efforts, it is the one in Syria. This conflict has given rise to an unprecedented movement of refugees towards neighbouring countries. Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are on the front line, then Europe and beyond. This situation is untenable. We must do everything possible to address this crisis as best we can, observing international law and welcoming and protecting refugees. We must do everything possible to put an end to this dreadful war that is destroying Syria and destabilizing the entire region. For more than five years, Syria has been martyred both by the brutal repression and atrocities carried out by the Al-Assad regime and by the abominable terrorist crimes committed by Da’esh and other terrorist groups that are rife in the country, profiting from a war economy and receiving external support.\\nThe toll is terrible. The United Nations estimates that there have been more than 300,000 victims, including tens of thousands of children. An entire generation of children has been exposed to violence and death, deprived of fundamental freedoms, protection and education. Random air bombings and airdrops of barrels of explosives, the use of chemical weapons, violence and violations of international law continue without respite. Sieges are ongoing. Assistance is denied and impediments to humanitarian aid continue. Humanitarian convoys are deliberately targeted.\\nI take this opportunity to renew our appeal to the parties, in particular the Syrian authorities, to afford rapid, safe and unobstructed access by United Nations and humanitarian organizations throughout Syria. Even war has rules. And so long as the war lasts, we must demand and ensure that these rules and international humanitarian law are respected. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria, whatever they are, must be brought to justice, including before the International Criminal Court.\\nI commend the repeated efforts of the United States of America and Russia. They have led to a new agreement on cessation of hostilities that came into force 10 days ago. This fragile agreement was renounced by the Syrian army, then crippled by the unacceptable attack on a humanitarian convoy on 19 September. It must be respected and scrupulously observed.\\nThe solution to the conflict in Syria can be achieved through a political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, in line with the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/523, annex) and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). The United Nations must play a determining role to facilitate negotiations among Syrians to bring about a political transition that should include all members of Syrian society.\\nOn 4 February, I attendeded, with our Minister for Cooperation and Humanitarian Action, the London 2016 donors conference, entitled “Supporting Syria and the region”. We will adhere to the commitment to provide €37.5 million between 2016 and 2020 to help the victims of the conflict in Syria and in neighbouring countries, with an emphasis on children’s education, in particular by supporting the UNICEF programme “No lost generation”.\\nLast week, I returned from a visit to Israel and Palestine. While the Syrian conflict is hitting the headlines, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a strong factor for destabilization in the Middle East. It is a catalyst for frustration and hatred that terrorist movements in the region feed on brazenly. We cannot resign ourselves to allowing this conflict to continue. The two-State solution is the only possible way of arriving at a sustainable settlement of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. The parameters of this solution are well known and include the 1967 borders and Jerusalem as the capital of two States.\\nDuring my recent visit, I encouraged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to resume direct dialogue. If there is no movement, the international community must play its role. We also support initiatives such as those taken by France to organize an international conference to help the parties to resume negotiations in order to arrive at a two-State solution. We continue to believe that the negotiating format should be broadened, with increased participation of Arab and European countries. In addition, the role of the Security Council should be reactivated and a reasonable deadline for the conclusion of negotiations should be established.\\nIsrael has the right to live in peace and security. The Palestinians have the right to a sovereign, independent, democratic, contiguous and viable State. The two go hand in hand. There is no alternative to coexistence, in peace and security. It is important for them to stop talking about each other and instead to talk to each other. Diplomacy can resolve the thorniest of problems. As proof of this, a comprehensive solution to the issue of Iranian nuclear weapons was reached last year.\\nWe must remain vigilant when it comes to the implementation Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Nuclear non-proliferation efforts continue to be undermined by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The multiple ballistic missiles launched by North Korea and the recent North Korean nuclear test are in flagrant violation of the international obligations imposed on the country by Security Council resolutions. This provocative escalation is unacceptable. Apart from any Security Council measures that will be taken, the Six-Party Talks on North Korea’s nuclear programme need to resume in order to bring about verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula by pacific means.\\nIn all the areas I have touched upon, we recognize that the United Nations has a leading role to play. As a founding country of the United Nations, Luxembourg has based its foreign policy on its active participation in multilateral cooperation, a multilateralism that is rooted in respect for international law and cooperation among sovereign and equal States. Our commitment to strong and effective multilateralism, with the United Nations at its heart, inspired us during our historic first term on the Security Council, in 2013-2014. This same commitment led my Government to propose Luxembourg as a candidate for a seat on the Security Council for a two-year term in 2031 and 2032. Our candidacy illustrates Luxembourg’s resolve to continue to serve the United Nations as a responsible member of the international community, dedicated to the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.\\nI shall leave New York this week with hope in my heart. The many speeches that we have heard in this Hall show that dialogue is possible. Our credibility is at stake. The world expects action, not words. Let us get to work!\\n', 'It is always an honour for me to address the General Assembly. It is also a responsibility — above all given the serious and worrying situation in the world. I stand before those present on behalf of France to issue several appeals. First, I would like to ask all members to do everything possible to implement the historic Agreement that was signed in Paris on 12 December 2015. The Agreement was historic because the conference was held at a time when Paris, the capital of France, had been struck by terrorist attacks. The Agreement was historic because, for the first time, the assembled international community agreed to make a commitment to reducing global warming and mobilizing financing, while allowing the most vulnerable countries to make an energy transition.\\nAnd yet, standing before the Assembly, let me state once again that despite the momentous nature of the Agreement, there is no time to lose. The past two years have been the hottest known to humankind since records began. Admittedly, in April 2016, right here with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, an agreement was signed with 175 countries. But everyone here knows that it will come into force only if it is ratified by 55 per cent of countries, representing 55 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States and China have announced their decision to ratify, which is very important. Nothing would have been possible without the participation and the commitment of those two countries, which are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide. France itself will notify the United Nations tomorrow that it has completed its ratification procedure. I appeal to all members to speed up their ratification procedures so that the goal is met by the end of the year.\\nThe twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-21) was a conference of decisions. The twenty-second session, to be held in Marrakech, should be a conference of solutions. It is a question of implementing the International Solar Alliance, fighting desertification, protecting the seas and also setting a carbon price.\\nHowever, the appeal I want to issue to the Assembly, following this climate agreement, is an appeal for Africa. Africa is a continent full of promise, but its development could be hindered by climate change, migration, conflict, war and terrorism. The continent has a bright future; however, it may also be the one to cause growing insecurity, and that insecurity targets, first and foremost, Africans themselves.\\nThat is why, on behalf of France, I am proposing a 2020 agenda for Africa. The plan should make it possible for all Africans to gain access to electricity. Two thirds of Africans today are deprived of it. That is an injustice, but above all it impedes sustainable growth in Africa. What is at stake, therefore, is responding to the needs of 15 per cent of the world population. What is at stake is enabling Africans to benefit from their immense potential for development. What is at issue here is reducing population displacements, that is, migration, which leads to the destabilization of both countries of origin and destination.\\nThat is why, at the Paris Conference, I launched the African Renewable Energy Initiative. Ten donors — and I want thank them here — pledged to donate $10 billion by 2020. France has assumed 20 per cent of that amount, or €2 billion. Europe has decided on an external investment plan, which could reach — still with a view to providing Africans with access to electricity — nearly €40 billion, and even double that amount if European Union member States contribute as well. I call on all countries to join that effort. I am not just calling for solidarity here — for this is a mutual investment that will benefit the whole world — I call for this to happen as soon as possible.\\nBut there will be no development in Africa unless the continent’s security is ensured. When I committed France to acting in Mali, it did so with an awareness of its responsibility. We had to prevent terrorist groups from taking over an entire country and destabilizing an entire region. Today, that threat has been rolled back and Mali is regaining its territorial integrity. But other groups, including Boko Haram and Al-Qaida, are emerging to threaten the security of many countries in West Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. There too, France is supporting military forces with training, information-sharing and assistance in the fight against terrorism. We are doing so, for instance, in the Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Benin and Cameroon. We should expand such efforts along with the United Nations and the African Union.\\nLet us be clear — the security of Africans has to come from Africans themselves if we want to avoid external intrusion and interference. My appeal for development and renewable energy is also a call for the security of Africans, for equipping their armies and giving them the means to respond, and for these African nations to organize their own development in a free and sovereign manner.\\nThe last call I wish to make here is perhaps the saddest of all. It is for Syria. The Syrian tragedy will go down in history as a disgrace for the international community if we do not end it quickly. Aleppo is today a martyred city, and this is how it shall remain in historical memory. Thousands of children have died in bombings, entire populations are starving, humanitarian convoys are being attacked, and chemical weapons are being used.\\nI have one thing to say in this regard — enough is enough. Just like in February, the ceasefire held for only a few days. It ended practically the day after its announcement, before its terms were even understood. The regime is responsible for its failure and cannot be exonerated for mistakes that could have been made by others. I would say to its foreign supporters — and we all know who they are — that they need to compel the regime’s hand to peace. If they do not then they, alongside the regime, shall bear responsibility for the division and chaos in Syria.\\nThe Security Council must meet as soon as possible. It should not be a theatre of fools — in other words, a place where responsibility can be evaded and where some can impede its work in order to protect a regime while they should be seeking a solution with us. France has four demands. First, we must first impose the ceasefire in line with the decisions that have been taken. That is the precondition. Secondly, we need to ensure the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to Aleppo and other martyred cities. That is the priority. Thirdly, we must ensure the resumption of political negotiations along the lines of the transition established in 2012. That is the solution. Fourthly, we must sanction the use of chemical weapons. That is justice.\\nIf we take these decisions and act now, there will be a solution for Syria. In fact, it will be more than a solution; there will finally be hope for refugees and displaced persons. There will finally be action that will allow Syria to maintain its territorial integrity. We are also determined to see an intervention in Iraq that will help to free the entire country from the Da’esh occupation of its territory. If we decide to act effectively against terrorism, we can prevent further terrorist attacks around the world. The risk is chaos and division, and it exists beyond Syria. It also exists in Libya. Our priority must be to re-establish the State around the Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Al-Sarraj — a goal for which France is working with its partners and the United Nations.\\nWe cannot sit back and do nothing. That would be playing into the hands of the forces, terrorists in particular, that aim to destabilize the world. France shall never resign itself, even if it is difficult — especially if it is difficult — and that is why it has taken the initiative to contribute to seeking a solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Of course, no one can impose a solution on the parties, but once again, resigning ourselves to the status quo involves taking a risk. It means allowing settlement to take place once again. It means once again allowing unjust, unfair and unacceptable violence to take place. The objective, therefore, is to meet here at the end of the year and hold a conference at which Israelis and Palestinians can assume their responsibilities to negotiate.\\nThis same spirit led me, along with Chancellor Merkel, to seek a solution in Ukraine. It led to the creation of the Normandy format, which allowed us to come to an agreement in Minsk. Today, we must do everything we can to ensure that the agreement is implemented; if we do not, there will be renewed violence and perhaps even the resumption of war. I recall that this conflict has claimed more than 6,000 victims. I have therefore taken the initiative, along with the Chancellor of Germany, to bring together the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents in the weeks to come to promote progress in the implementation of the Minsk accords.We will not abandon that goal. We will renounce no initiative that we think may be useful.\\nI have raised the issue of terrorism, which threatens every country of the world. Long is the list of all those whom it has impacted in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and even Oceania. No country can claim to be immune to the threat of Islamist terrorism, fundamentalism and fanaticism, which have seduced and radicalized lost individuals within our societies. There is no sea or wall that can protect a country from this tragedy and the scourge of terrorist action, attacks or aggressions. Terrorism thrives on open conflicts that have remained unsolved for too long. It has provoked a wave of refugees and undermined international order, borders that we thought fixed, law that we thought we could maintain and the collective security that was the very principle of the United Nations.\\nIn the face of these dangers, France once again turns to the United Nations. The United Nations has shown its effectiveness with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which many thought was impossible. United Nations peacekeeping operations have never been as numerous as they are now.\\nHowever, if we want to act to eradicate terrorism, we will need to make decisions and not merely talk of solidarity when a friendly country is attacked or merely express compassion for the victims. We must shoulder responsibilities whenever that can be useful. That is what France does. Not because it is attacked — today, as I have said, every country is a target for terrorism. No, France does it because it is a permanent member of the Security Council and its role is about acting, not creating obstacles. France does it because it has one great idea, the idea that it has upheld throughout its history — bringing freedom, democracy and justice to the world. It is because France puts its policies at the service of a single goal — peace — and talks to everyone involved. It is because France is an independent nation that respects the law and has no enemies other than the forces of hatred and intolerance that use a betrayed religion to create fear. It is because we must fight the populists who exploit distress in order to divide, separate, stigmatize and pit religions against one another, risking confrontations that would have terrible consequences for cohesion in our societies. France is a secular country that proclaims itself as such but that speaks to every religion and guarantees freedom of worship on its soil, because the only interests we have in the world are stability, development and the future of our planet.\\nThat is why France is so committed to the United Nations and demonstrates it every day. I want to pay tribute to the President of the General Assembly, to all who dedicate themselves to the United Nations, beginning with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who for 10 years has led this difficult mission on behalf of all of us and enabled us to advance its cause. And that is also why, in the face of the major challenges I have mentioned, especially Syria and the fight against terrorism, I expect the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities. There comes a moment for every generation and public official when the only question worth asking is whether we have made decisions — and whether they are good decisions. The countries here are all different sizes, at different levels of development and with different sensitivities and beliefs, but they should have only one goal and one demand, which is that the world should rise to the challenges facing the planet.\\nThat is why I want to appeal to all those here — to call for implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, for ensuring that Africa and all Africans have electricity and better development, and for peace in Syria, because it is so urgently needed. That is why I believe in the United Nations, and that is why both France and I are sending a universal message.\\n', '“None of us acting alone can achieve success.” These are the words of Nelson Mandela. We must decide and act together because only together can we come up with right responses to the many challenges that we face. Our responsibility is to offer every child — boy or girl — the keys to his or her own emancipation. Every man, every woman, wherever they are born, bears universal rights. They must be able to learn, to work, to care for themselves and to raise their children in peace and security. Technological, medical and social progress must be shared. It must not belong to a privileged few. That must be our commitment and our common goal.\\nWe know the path by which we can reach such a goal. It has been embodied since 1948 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The universal values are a beacon that must shed an immutable light on the path of humankind. There should be no exception, no compromise and no renouncement of the respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy.\\nAnd yet, let us look at the truth. Equality between women and man is not always a fact of life. Freedom of expression and freedom of the press are too often flouted. Homophobia, in some countries, has even been legalized, sometimes even through recent laws. In addition, too often, the rule of law is a smokescreen and justice is not a remedy but a threat to citizens and businesses.\\nThe African continent overflows with strengths and talents. Its potential is immense. The histories of Europe and Africa are intrinsically linked and, of course, we share a future. It is vital that we all mobilize to encourage and support Africa’s development, first of all, through more fairly apportioned economic growth and the emergence of a middle class. I support the creation of a genuinely equal, win-win partnership with Africa, based neither on nostalgia or guilt.\\nI firmly believe, as history has always shown, that strengthened democratic rights and personal freedoms always go hand in hand with development and the improvement of people’s living conditions. In the past few years, Africa has seen several successful democratic transitions, due above all to those citizens who have participated in their political and electoral processes and thereby solidified their democratic institutions and sovereignty.\\nUnfortunately, some citizens are still too often deprived of the fundamental right to elect those who are supposed to represent them. In the words of John F. Kennedy, “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.” An honest election is a peaceful revolution, because the only legitimate Government is an elected one. Respect for the requirements of the rule of law, and therefore of a country’s constitution, is the only possible way to ensure stability and democratic harmony. The people of Burundi have been denied that right, resulting in discord, division and even oppression. The only solution to that crisis is a genuinely inclusive inter-Burundian dialogue conducted under international mediation and in accordance with the Arusha Peace Agreement.\\nIt is crucial that elections be held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and all doubts surrounding them removed. I firmly condemn all the violence that we have witnessed there, including in the past few days in Kinshasa. Those who exercise authority must assume their full and individual share of responsibility. I want to be very clear here. We respect the principles of sovereignty and independence, but on the condition that sovereignty does not become a smokescreen for abusing the rule of law and violating fundamental freedoms. I appeal to the country’s political leaders both in the majority and the opposition to avoid an escalation. There should be a broad, inclusive dialogue. They should be equal to their country and people. They should not hide their faces. The only path to stability is by establishing, as soon as possible, a definite date for holding honest, credible elections.\\nAt this point, we must admit that the situation in Syria constitutes a continuing failure for the international community. It is a country torn apart by unspeakable suffering, where massive numbers of refugees have been uprooted from their homes. We cannot accept the notion that the chaos in Syria serves the long-term geostrategic interests of Syrians, or their future. We cannot accept that one man’s bloody obduracy stands in the way of a political solution and peace. We support Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura and urge all the permanent members of the Security Council to show that they have a sense of responsibility. We would also like to remind them that there can be no impunity for violations of international humanitarian law.\\nWith Da’esh, as with Al-Qaida, Boko Haram and Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, what we are dealing with is in fact a new totalitarianism. At question are fanaticism and the negation of human life itself. They want to destroy freedom. They have chosen the path of barbarism and terror. Like many others, my country suffered a tragic blow from them, last March. The fight we must wage against terrorism must be a shared one, uncompromising and intransigent. Naturally, we support the Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism (A/70/674). But we must do more and better, systematizing our exchanges of information and intelligence in order to anticipate and prevent such barbaric acts. Freedom must be stronger than the shadows.\\nAround the world, there are 65 million women and men who are either refugees or displaced. Countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are on the front lines as hosts to huge numbers of refugees, with all the difficulties that entails. Every continent is involved, and we know what the causes are: war, poverty, climate change. Needless to say, peace and development are the best responses we can make, and we must also ensure the dignity of every human being, with special concern for those who are most vulnerable — women and children.\\nPolitical dialogue and international negotiations are tedious processes, too often slow and strewn with obstacles, with as many steps backward as forward. That often results in frustration and sometimes even a feeling of powerlessness. And yet I believe firmly that inclusive, stubborn, tenacious political dialogue is the surest way to finding lasting solutions. And we should also highlight international diplomacy’s successes. The peace agreement between the Colombian authorities and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, the formation of a Government in Libya, the nuclear agreement with Iran, the diplomatic rapprochement between Cuba and the United States and the fight against Ebola are all examples of progress and success, holding a key to a better and safer life for millions.\\nHow true is the saying, often attributed to Nelson Mandela, that a winner is a dreamer who never gives up. I too believe that courage and tenacity are key to advancing peace and ensuring a more secure, more just world. We should never lose hope or abandon ourselves to fatalism.\\nThe situation in Israel and Palestine today is yet another illustration of the urgency and importance of reviving the political process in order to arrive at a definitive solution to the conflict. We support a two-State solution, but in the current circumstances, if no fundamental change is made, we know that this prospect may be irretrievably lost.\\nWe should put a stop to the acts that hinder such a solution. We condemn the continued settlement activities in the occupied territories. At the same time, we are firmly committed to maintaining Israel’s security, which must be guaranteed. We support France’s initiative aimed at facilitating the resumption of talks. In another essential step, the Palestinians must also advance their own dialogue.\\nInternational law cannot be reduced to the law of the jungle. On the frontiers of Europe, the territorial integrity of several countries has been violated by one country alone. It is not acceptable to fan the flames of conflict in order to soothe nostalgic feelings of grandeur. I urge that we work to find a way out of this logic of confrontation with Russia. We have too many interests in common to allow ourselves the luxury of diplomatic paralysis.\\nIn the past few years we have made a lot of progress in reducing poverty and improving access to basic health care. But we know very well that there is still so much to do. The Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change have given us a proactive framework to continue making progress, and we should strive unstintingly to implement them. It is our duty to future generations to create a safer world that is more respectful of our planet.\\nEconomic exchanges and international trade contribute to worldwide growth and employment. Free enterprise, the private finance initiative and economic exchanges are the foundations of development: they fuel research, technological innovation and even medical progress. We must promote transparency in the fiscal and banking sectors and fight all forms of corruption. Capitalism is not naturally virtuous: just and transparent rules are necessary. However, in many countries employees are not properly compensated for their work. Capitalism is not an end in itself, but an instrument that we must put to use at the service of human development: no more, no less.\\nThe global economic situation is constricting State budgets. Work is often too heavily taxed in comparison to other sources of revenue. For that reason, Belgium, along with 10 other countries of the European Union, would like to develop a system to tax financial transactions. We must succeed in removing the technical and political obstacles. It is a question of elementary equity.\\nIt is an honour for my country to defend the universal principles and values of liberty, tolerance and dialogue. We fully respect the traditions, cultures and identities of the various peoples of the world, and we believe that universal values are the shared foundation of a fairer and safer world. We believe in the virtues of multilateralism and the persistent search for consensus through political dialogue.\\nBelgium is an active, stable and loyal member of the international community. For that reason, we are a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2019-2020 period. I sincerely hope that we can count on the support of a large number of countries in that election.\\nI also wish to extend my gratitude to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to peace and security. His intelligence and creativity have meant that he leaves behind a solid legacy. I already have high hopes for his successor, who will, we hope, ensure the proper implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\\nA politician concerns himself with the next election, whereas a statesman concerns himself with the future of the next generation. Let us strive to meet the expectations of our citizens, fulfil our universal values and act as statesmen.\\n', 'I belong to a generation that was born into a globalized world. For us, globalization is not a threat — it is a fact of life. As Kofi Annan once said, arguing against globalization is like arguing against the laws of gravity. Let us be clear: the fact that the world has grown closer together has brought about enormous benefits. It has reduced international poverty, contributed to the spread of technology and reduced the distances between countries.\\nBut we must also recognize that globalization has not only led to positive consequences; it also created new challenges. Events taking place on the other side of the globe can have a direct impact on our lives. That includes not only in the economic world, but in all spheres of life. Especially in recent years, we have seen a dramatic increase in threats to stability throughout the world.\\nWhen I started out as Foreign Minister, in December 2013, Ukraine had full sovereignty over its eastern borders and Crimea. The Iraqi Government was still in control of Mosul and other parts of the country, and religious minorities, such as the Yazidis, still lived in peace and security in their homeland. Yet today, thinking in terms of confrontational blocs has returned to Europe. Today Da’esh threatens whole States, and radicalization and violent extremism are on the rise worldwide.\\nGiven those developments, I can understand that people are shocked and overburdened by the many images they see of violence, suffering and destruction, and that they would wish to block those images from their living rooms. But the truth is that, while one can turn off the television and block off the news from one’s home, what cannot be changed in a globalized world is the fact that something taking place elsewhere can have a direct impact on our lives. The more interconnected our world becomes, the greater the responsibility of each one of us is to not ignore events taking place in other parts of the world. The more globalized our world becomes, the more interest each one of us must take in strengthening stability and prosperity in other parts of the world, not only out of solidarity but also out of self-interest.\\nOne thing is very clear today: we all need to join forces. We need the United Nations, the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). And we need effective multilateralism to achieve what we most desire, namely, security and stability.\\nToday threats to security and stability arise from many challenges at the same time. The destruction caused by military conflicts is increasing, violent extremism is growing and weapons of mass destruction still exist. The conflict that is closest to us in Austria is the one in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. We remain very concerned, because the Minsk Agreement has still not been implemented, and progress has been frustratingly slow. In our opinion, we need to find solutions beyond the ceasefires. We need a free and stable Ukraine that has good relations with both the Russian Federation and the European Union.\\nTo achieve greater security, we must rebuild trust. In that respect, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which reaches from Vancouver to Vladivostok, is uniquely placed to promote stability and security. During Austria’s chairmanship of the OSCE in 2017, we intend to contribute to rebuilding trust and defusing conflicts in the OSCE area, such as in eastern Ukraine, Georgia, Nagorno Karabakh and Transnistria. But we are also faced with a ring of instability in Europe’s wider neighbourhood — in Syria, Iraq and Libya.\\nOn Syria, we need to reinforce diplomatic efforts to establish a ceasefire, enable safe access for humanitarian aid and start a political process. That is the only way to end the ongoing humanitarian crisis in that long-suffering country. We are outraged by the attacks on medical facilities and aid convoys. Let me be clear: all of those who committed crimes against civilians must be brought to justice.\\nAround the globe, radicalization and violent extremism pose serious threats to our societies, undermining security, development, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We must all realize that acts of religious extremism do not happen only in areas of conflict; there are religious extremists who radicalize our youth even in the heart of our own societies. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters have joined the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in order to rape, kill and try to exterminate religious minorities in other parts of the world. They include more than 5,000 people from the EU, among them 300 from Austria. We cannot accept that our citizens commit such crimes in other parts of the world, and we have to be clear that when they return, they pose a major threat to our societies. We therefore have to increase efforts within our communities to prevent young people from being misled by those who abuse religion.\\nWe also have to remain committed in our fight against Da’esh and other terrorist groups in countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya, because destroying Da’esh would be the most powerful measure to counter radicalization. The more we deny radical terrorists their success stories, the fewer new fighters will be recruited from other parts of the world. If we are unsuccessful in that fight, we will see increased radicalization and terrorism worldwide, with no safe havens, neither in Europe nor elsewhere.\\nIn an ever less secure world facing ever greater tensions among the major Powers, nuclear disarmament remains the number one unfinished business. The recent nuclear tests by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea serve as a warning sign. We all agree that the humanitarian consequences of a nuclear-weapon explosion would be unacceptable. We must therefore finally rid ourselves of all nuclear weapons. Experience shows that the first step in eliminating weapons of mass destruction is to prohibit them through legally binding norms. Together with other Member States, Austria will submit a draft resolution to convene negotiations on a legally binding comprehensive instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons in 2017.\\nBut that is not enough. We also need to put an end to the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. When such weapons are used in cities and other urban areas — as we have seen in Syria — more than 90 per cent of the victims are civilians. The destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure forces people to leave. The world would be a safer place without such weapons, especially for children, women and elderly people. We will therefore convene a meeting in early October to promote that goal, and we hope for Members’ support.\\nThe United Nations is central when it comes to tackling the global challenges of our time. We need an effective guardian for our shared values and principles. We need a strong United Nations to provide security, achieve stability and restore people’s confidence. In that context, I would like to express my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership during his two terms at the United Nations. His moral leadership has made it possible to achieve success, inter alia, through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Let me assure all of those present that Austria will remain committed to supporting the United Nations and its goals, both as a Member State and as the host country to one of its headquarters.\\n', 'Before I came here, Sahar Afzal, a representative of Dutch youth, asked me a simple question. “Minister,” he said, “do you still believe in the United Nations?” That question made me think. A plain and simple yes is the answer one would probably expect from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a nation with a strong tradition of cooperation, dialogue and partnership and a founding Member of the United Nations, with an active commitment to peace, justice and development. But my answer was not that simple. The English art critic Clive Bell wrote that while we believe, what we believe is not necessarily true. There can be a lot of wishful thinking in believing something. Believing is not always enough. It is what we do that matters. And so it is when we look at the United Nations, as the world’s premier global multilateral organization.\\nThere is widespread agreement that the United Nations needs to reassert and transform itself, and I think that is correct. The challenges are enormous; according to some, the world is at a tipping point. And the outlook is indeed gloomy. Geopolitical fault lines are deepening. Shifts in the global economy are fuelling tension and uncertainty. Growth has stagnated. Inequality within and among countries has grown. Worldwide, the number of refugees is the highest it has been since the founding of the United Nations. Promising democracy movements have turned into bloody conflicts, and new wars have broken out, the most tragic examples being the conflict in Syria and the brutal extremism of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Terrorism has taken a deadly toll in many places around the world, including on my continent, Europe. Violence against women in war zones and elsewhere is a scourge.\\nThere is no denying it — too many people in the world have drawn the short straw. In a world of globalization, climate change and conflict, they are losing out. The longer we permit that to go on, the further we drift from the inclusive United Nations ideal of “we the peoples”. Not “we, some people”, but “we the peoples”. Will we be able to strengthen our positive forces, or will we let the negative forces tear the world apart? At this pivotal moment in history, the United Nations and the other institutions that were built to bring us together must be strong enough to prevent that from happening. But are they? The idea of unstoppable, progressive global integration has lost its aura of inevitability. On my own continent, the process of European cooperation is being debated. In many places inside and outside Europe, ghosts of the past have come back to haunt us — nationalism and xenophobia. And when I see the kinds of stories about the United Nations that are being reported in my own country, the Netherlands — which has traditionally been a very strong supporter — I realize that the United Nations is too often seen as helpless and fragmented, an overwhelmed Organization struggling to cope with the challenges it faces.\\nAnd yet the United Nations has no choice but to play a key role in delivering solutions, now and in future, in order to make the world safer, more just and better prepared for what the future brings. There is no alternative. The United Nations is the best imperfect global Organization we have, the only global Organization that embodies the principles of multilateralism — legitimacy, universality and standard-setting authority and that has not only convening power, which is very important, but also the ability to deliver services on a global scale.\\nWhat must be done? As the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and, only this week, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) have shown, the United Nations remains the one legitimate institution where international goals and ambitions are set and where we can agree on new global challenges. But now is the time for implementation. We must walk the talk. I know that implementation is not always very sexy. It does not often make headlines. It is not usually accompanied by Angélique Kidjo or Shakira singing onstage, as they did last year in this very Hall during the magnificent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. But implementation is necessary to deliver on the goals we set, and it is necessary for the Organization to remain relevant and credible — to survive.\\nThat is why I believe that a shift from outcome documents to action and execution should be the top priority of both the United Nations membership and the new Secretary-General. The new Secretary- General should be an “Implementer-General”, working on the basis of a twenty-first-century vision of global cooperation. There is plenty of work to do. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is leaving his successor an impressive body of standards, objectives and recommendations, and the Netherlands is grateful for his enormous leadership during a very difficult period. The new Secretary-General can hit the ground running and boost further implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, of peacekeeping and peacebuilding reform, including real zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as the very important issue of reform of the United Nations development system.\\nBut the Secretary-General cannot do it alone. The membership must shoulder its responsibilities. At a time of so many false notes, we need to work on our global orchestra. Maybe the States Members of the United Nations should declare a moratorium on new and lofty outcome documents until we have delivered on the commitments and promises made in the ones that we already have adopted. Let us pause in the talk for a while and get the action going for the people whom we represent.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands is ready to support the new Secretary-General in a drive for implementation. Implementation is not just technique; it is mastering the political will to get things done. We have made a good start with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in our own country. We look forward to sharing our national voluntary presentation with the membership next summer. Globally, we are committed to an integrated approach to peace and security, development and human rights that leaves no one behind. The Netherlands is a top-10 humanitarian donor, a supporter of and a contributor to peacekeeping. We will ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change shortly. We would like the migration compact and the refugee compact provided for in the New York Declaration on Migrants and Refugees to be clear and actionable.\\nUnited Nations reform needs to pick up steam now. The Security Council continues to fulfil a crucial role, imperfect as it may be. But it is no longer 1945. The Council is simply not representative enough. We need to devise a way to fix that shortcoming before it is too late, even if it means thinking outside the box. As the Assembly may recall, I have suggested that a Council seat be assigned to the European Union in due course, and I invite other regions to also reflect on collective regional representation on the Council.\\nThe right of the veto should not render the Security Council powerless, especially when — as we see every day, including this week — mass atrocities are being committed. Council members should be more conscious of their responsibilities and be held more accountable if they block action against breaches of international humanitarian law. Last year’s important reviews — and I think they were very important — of peace operations and peacebuilding underline the primacy of political solutions and of sustaining the peace. I could not agree more.\\nMore focus on conflict prevention is also needed. Indeed, this community has been underlining the need for conflict prevention for 50 years. Successful preventive diplomacy can keep situations of concern from spiralling out of control. It can keep cases from being added to the Council’s agenda; once a case is taken up by the Security Council — let us face it — we in a sense have already collectively failed. We need to make sure that there are sufficient resources for political missions, mediation and other preventive actions. In its recent report, the Independent Commission on Multilateralism recommends a fundraising drive for prevention. While that is an admirable suggestion, I would say that what is needed is not fundraising for prevention, but budgeting for prevention. If we agree that conflict prevention is crucial to the mandate of the United Nations, then we must devote sufficient resources to it from the regular budget, through assessed contributions by all Member States and not just through the extrabudgetary generosity of a few. That may require a thorough review and reprioritization of the way in which budget resources are allocated at the United Nations.\\nThe points that I am making are part of an integrated approach that my country has long advocated, including during our previous term on the Security Council. We intend to pursue that approach during our 2018 Council term as well. Conflicts cannot be resolved unless the root causes are addressed. Peace, justice and development are closely interlinked and should not be dealt with in isolation. The Peacebuilding Fund, which was established in 2005, is a good example of an integrated approach to sustaining peace, as the great pledging conference that we held yesterday illustrates. I am pleased to say that, earlier this week, the Netherlands pledged €10 million to the Fund. The growing recognition of the importance of accountability is another example. There can be no durable peace without justice and respect for human rights. Tomorrow I will deposit the instrument of ratification of the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on the crime of aggression.\\nOther Security Council priorities for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 2018 include the protection of civilians and addressing the peace and security implications of climate change. As a Kingdom consisting of one low-lying country, the Netherlands, and three small Caribbean island countries, Aruba, Curacao and Sint Maarten, that is an issue of particular concern to us.\\nFortunately, the grim tableau that I sketched a moment ago is not the whole picture. There has been genuine and significant progress. In the past 20 years, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has been halved. That was one of the Millennium Development Goals, which we achieved well before the 2015 deadline. I remember that many of us in this Hall believed that that would not be possible. Well, that Goal was reached.\\nSometimes lightning does strike twice. The international community has reached agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Another major achievement and a victory for diplomacy in a time of so much strife is the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. With the recent ratifications by China and the United States, there is a real prospect that it will enter into force, hopefully before Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon leaves office at the end of this year. That is in large part his legacy, and we commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for it.\\nAnd, yes, there have also been positive developments in the area of security. New and important work has been undertaken to stop foreign terrorist fighters from travelling to conflict zones, to halt the financing of terrorism, to impose sanctions on ISIS, and to work in communities on deradicalization and local support, putting together hard and soft security. The Netherlands, together with Morocco, is trying to do its part as co-Chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum. Preventing violent extremism is now also high on our United Nations agenda, thanks to the Secretary- General’s plan of action.\\nAnd, yes, peacekeeping has evolved and has been transformed from traditional ceasefire monitoring missions into very complex missions with integrated mandates. More attention is being paid to the entire spectrum of peacekeeping, from early warning and prevention to peacebuilding in the fragile post-conflict period. And more consideration is being given to the protection of civilians — the goal of peacekeeping missions — including the tackling of gender and sexual abuse and the important task of establishing the rule of law.\\nThat is not just theory or statistics. Ask the 12,000 people who sought refuge at the United Nations compound in Bor, South Sudan. Head of Mission Ken Payumo had the courage to let them in and protect them. Ask the women of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where, thanks to the gender unit in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission, sexual violence has decreased substantially since 2013. Ask the people of Nepal, where, in 2006, the United Nations helped the Seven-Party Alliance to sustain the peaceful solution to the conflict.\\nAllow me to briefly go back to the previous term of the Netherlands on the Security Council. Our first meeting was on Sunday, 2 January 1999, when the Council convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon. A United Nations-chartered plane had just been shot down in war-ravaged Angola. United Nations personnel were being held hostage by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. Two decades later, Angola has seen substantial improvements; it is currently a non-permanent member of the Council. Or take Sierra Leone, another country that was frequently on the Council’s agenda that year. The international community helped to broker a peace agreement and put in place a large peacekeeping operation. In 2004, a United Nations-backed war crimes court, located in the Netherlands, began trying senior leaders on both sides of the conflict. Sierra Leone now has a democratically elected President and, with international support, is emerging from the recent Ebola crisis.\\nIn all these cases, we can see the results of hard work, sustained effort and prolonged investment by the international community. Those are results that should make us proud and hopeful. But such successes soon fade from the public mind when they are replaced by images of children suffering the trauma of wars for which they are not responsible. We cannot deny that there have been peace and security failures. The list has the power to shock: Rwanda, Srebrenica. Now it includes Yemen and, of course, Syria, with Aleppo as a terrifying symbol.\\nThe number-one priority now is to restore the cessation of hostilities and ensure humanitarian access. I call upon the parties most closely involved to do everything in their power to make that happen as soon as possible. And I call upon them, as I have done before, to ensure proper and transparent monitoring of any such cessation of hostilities. If non-compliance becomes the norm, how can we expect Syrians to trust the international community and to put their faith in the United Nations system?\\nIn resolution 2254 (2015), the Security Council unanimously expressed its support for a nationwide ceasefire in Syria. If violence continues to be the norm, I urge the Council not to remain silent. Like my French colleague, I wish to ensure better monitoring and follow-up when a ceasefire is breached. At the International Syria Support Group, which will meet this afternoon, we will call for more qualitative and transparent monitoring and for the systematic violations of ceasefires to be dealt with by the Security Council.\\nAt the same time, let us not forget the primacy of politics. While we work frantically to relieve the tragic humanitarian situation, work on a political transition plan for Syria should go ahead, since only a political solution can end the horrific tragedy. We wholeheartedly support the outstanding efforts by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Staffan de Mistura, and others to that end.\\nWhat is the value of the United Nations and where is its credibility if we talk about the responsibility to protect but are not capable of resolving the Syrian conflict or ready to answer the call by the High Commissioner for Human Rights for an independent international investigation into serious human rights violations in Yemen?\\nIn conclusion, what we do matters greatly. That is why I have stressed the need for an era of genuine implementation under the guidance of an “Implementer- General”. But how we talk about the United Nations also matters. By that I mean we must tell the real story, the whole story. We should not simply paint the usual gloomy picture of a powerless United Nations. We need to counter the entrenched view that the Organization is simply a burden to be borne and a scapegoat for our failures. The United Nations can be greater than the sum of its parts only if we allow it to be. And we must — there is too much at stake.\\nFinally, let me return to the question that I was asked: do I still believe in the United Nations? My answer was yes, but only if we show the determination and resolve of which the Charter speaks. The agenda is clear. The goals have been set. Now is the time to implement and deliver.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands will continue to do its part and will remain a steadfast supporter of the United Nations and its institutions, as it has been since the Organization’s inception. It is with that in mind that we are cooperating closely with Italy to prepare for membership of the Security Council.\\n', 'For far too many people, the world has become an unsafe place. The challenges confronting us seem immense, and at times it seems all but hopeless to find solutions to the many conflicts around us. However, all of us here, as politicians, have a choice. The choice is between resignation and engagement in those crises, between isolation and multilateral cooperation, and between national navel-gazing and shared responsibility for one another.\\nWe have the choice. Do we relinquish the civilizational progress achieved by the founding generation of the United Nations after experiencing two world wars and turn back to the nineteenth century? Do we return to the era of fragile, purpose-oriented power alliances and power struggles among nation States? Or do we move forward and work together to master the challenges of the twenty-first century, whether they be migration, climate change or terrorism?\\nIn light of the dramatic meetings on Syria this week, I would like to add that we can also choose whether to put our faith in the power of diplomacy, or to shrug our shoulders in resignation at the many conflicts around us — Syria, Libya, Yemen and eastern Ukraine. Do we give up and allow those conflicts to escalate even further? Or do we live up to our responsibility and continue working on solutions despite all the setbacks? We have the choice.\\nIn Europe, too, we are faced with a choice, now that the United Kingdom has made its choice and has opted to leave the European Union. Do we now fight to hold Europe together? Or do we allow that wonderful peace and social project to fall apart again, or even allow populists to drive us apart? We have the choice.\\nIn Asia, too, where new Powers are jostling for influence, there is also a choice. Do they believe that their future will depend solely on their own strength? Or does the key to a bright future and cooperative security lie in their involvement in the international order? Our Asian partners have the choice.\\nThe United States is also faced with a choice, in six weeks’ time. There, too, the choice is about a supposedly possible withdrawal from a crisis-ridden world, which some are calling for, or cooperation with international partners to solve the world’s problems. That choice is important for all of us. The choice before us is withdrawal, resignation and going it alone, or shared responsibility for a better future.\\nWhether we succeed in finding durable solutions to the major pressing challenges we face depends on the decision we make on that choice. I am talking in particular now about the Syrian crisis and the issue of refugees and migration. However, far beyond acute crisis management, that also presents us with a choice on which direction our world takes, and in what kind of international order we will live together in the future.\\nThe objective and focus of German foreign policy are clear — we want to shape a just and peaceful world, and we want to shape it together with all partners who share that goal. The United Nations is and will remain our central forum for that. In the context of all the crisis meetings, it gives me hope that we, here in the United Nations, have made an important choice about the direction we want to take, that is, the right choice.\\nOur choice has also been for unity, sustainability and transformation with the document that we adopted last year: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda is a global compact on the world’s future, the focal point, the point of convergence for our joint actions. Our policies should be based on human rights, the rule of law and the fight against poverty and discrimination. We will also put global justice on the agenda of the Group of 20 when we assume the chairmanship in 2017.\\nI wish to express our thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who initiated the 2030 Agenda. We would also like to thank him for his commitment to the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which the German Parliament ratified earlier this week. Where if not here, at the United Nations, could we demonstrate that, solely through cooperation, we can move forward towards justice and sustainability, towards peace and security. The Charter of the United Nations and international law provide the foundation for that.\\nNorth Korea has, in a blatant manner, repeatedly violated central principles of international law. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the latest nuclear test carried out by North Korea. We cannot accept any country jeopardizing security in that region.\\nThe United Nations provides the tools we need for our work here in New York and in crisis-stricken regions. In Libya and Yemen, we are supporting the tireless efforts of the Special Envoys of the Secretary- General to find political solutions. In Syria, it is clear that without the dedicated work of the United Nations and its experts, there would be even more suffering today and there would be even less hope for a solution. The hope raised a week ago by the ceasefire has again vanished, following the deadly, cynical and despicable attack on humanitarian aid workers a few days ago.\\nToday the situation could not be more serious. We are again faced with the choice. Will we succeed in taking the first step towards a ceasefire, which would finally make humanitarian access possible so that people can receive what they need to survive? To that end, I have proposed an agreement on banning military flights during a period of several days. Al-Assad’s Air Force must cease its attacks. I believe that Moscow also has a responsibility to help bring that about. If we do not succeed, then all efforts to find a political solution to Syria will be lost in a hail of bombs. For that reason alone, although unsuccessful yesterday, our efforts in the International Syria Support Group for a ceasefire must continue.\\nWhile the international community works hard in New York to bring about a ceasefire, Al-Assad continues to bomb Aleppo to bits, which again demonstrates that the Al-Assad regime cannot and must not be allowed to determine Syria’s future. However, we also cannot allow the conflict to be used by nearby or distant Powers to redraw the political and ethnic map of the Middle East. Syria’s external borders must remain, and we should not allow new internal borders to be defined. The parties in the country and the region can, and indeed should, declare their legitimate interests. However, a fair balance of those interests must be found. Insisting on one of the many absolute truths will not bring peace any closer. I reiterate and want to be quite clear: there will be no winners in that war.\\nIn the face of such suffering, we have an obligation to try right now to alleviate the plight of the Syrian people. Currently, Germany is one of the biggest donors of humanitarian aid. To date, we have made available approximately $2.5 billion for Syria and its neighbours. We have been particularly active in helping to stabilize areas in Iraq that have been liberated from the Islamic State. In Tikrit, we joined forces with United Nations agencies to rebuild schools and wells, so that as many as 90 per cent of those who have fled could return. In Ramadi, we are concentrating on unexploded mine clearance. In the case of Mosul, we are currently preparing to help local forces to begin rebuilding the city, which we hope will be liberated soon. At the same time, we are promoting access to education and the labour market in the countries neighbouring Syria — Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon — so that the people can have a future in their own region.\\nIn 2015 in Germany, we welcomed and gave shelter to more than 1 million people. We have begun training refugees so that they acquire the skills needed to rebuild their cities. The objective is to ensure that the belief in a future at home does not remain a mere hope but can become a reality.\\nOur response to refugee movements and migration must be a joint, global task in full awareness of the future. Clearly, the challenge will become even bigger if conflicts, hardship and poverty persist. That is why we must tackle the root causes together. Moreover, we must improve the architectural framework of international efforts designed to deal with refugee movements and migration. As co-Chair, along with Morocco, of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, we want to play our part during the next two years. Through the Berlin Round Table on Refugees and Migration, we are focusing on improving the structures of humanitarian assistance.\\nThe General Assembly’s high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, held on 19 September, took important decisions on still more joint actions. We wish to convey our thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and United States President Barack Obama for hosting the 20 September Leaders’ Summit on Refugees, alongside co-hosts Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico and Sweden.\\nWe also need to revitalize engagement and cooperation in Europe as well. New rifts have emerged on our continent following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, in violation of international law and the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The security situation has changed, and we need to react. First, we need to strengthen our readiness to defend ourselves. At the same time, we must also be engaged. Together with France, Russia and Ukraine, we have been working tirelessly in the Normandy format on a political solution to the Ukraine conflict. Progress has finally been achieved with the Trilateral Contact Group’s framework resolution on the disengagement of forces, which was ratified this week. A ceasefire is not all that is needed for the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, but we cannot make any political headway if the weapons are not silenced.\\nHowever, there is much more at stake. We must be aware that genuine and lasting security in Europe can only take the form of cooperative security. That is why, as I have proposed, we must pay more attention to arms control in Europe. Such efforts are not meant to substitute for obligations not yet met. Rather, I have in mind new challenges, new technologies and new threats, many of which have not even been mentioned in existing documents. Our goal is to enable security for everyone.\\nAs we seek to strengthen the dialogue between East and West, especially in these difficult times, we have assumed the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) this year. It is, by the way, the sole organization in which East and West continue to work together on a regular basis. We need the United Nations, as well as regional institutions such as the African Union and the OSCE, in order to ensure that diverging interests and differences of opinion do not turn into lasting alienation, thereby preparing the ground for even more new conflicts.\\nOur own history reminds us Germans that we must do everything we can to overcome the rifts in Europe. When Willy Brandt, then Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, spoke in the General Assembly on 26 September 1973, after the flags of the two parts of Germany had been hoisted in front of this building, he said:\\n“In a world in which we are all increasingly dependent on each other, a policy for peace must not stop at our own doorstep.” (A/PV.2128, para. 33)\\nThis is all the more true today in our interconnected world than it was back then. And it is all the more true for a large and prosperous country that our partners, rightly, perceive should play a role commensurate to its size and capabilities. It is for that reason that Germany is applying for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2019-2020 term. Peace, justice, innovation and partnership — those are our goals. They are the leitmotif of our candidature. and we will be guided by them.\\nDespite crises and conflicts, I still firmly believe that the future lies in our hands. We will make the world a better place if we assume responsibility together — not against but with one another and, above all, if we work for those who follow us as the next generation. We have the choice. But we have to decide!\\n', 'On 26 July in Abu Dhabi, the Swiss solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse, finished its world tour. On the same day that the whole world commended that technical feat, the International Organization for Migration issued a statement saying that, since the beginning of 2016, more than 3,000 migrants had lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea. That shows us that once again humankind is capable of the best and the worst: excellence in innovation at the service of the environment, but also powerlessness and a certain inertia in the face of immense tragedy, born of dictatorship, poverty and warfare.\\nThe challenges facing the international community are extensive. The situation in the Middle East and in certain regions of Africa, as well as at the gates of Europe, represent a tragic example of that. The weakening of States, economies and societies fosters the radicalization that can lead to terrorism and armed conflict, which bring with them their corollary victims — refugees and displaced persons. The consequences affect us all. Additional threats remain, such as natural disasters, climate change and its impacts and, indeed, antimicrobial resistance. Economic crises and the vicious cycle of unemployment, vulnerability and social exclusion that accompanies them are of concern to decision-makers around the world.\\nIn the face of the scale of those challenges, a strong United Nations is more necessary than ever. The Organization has already proved what it is capable of. Its tireless efforts to mobilize the international community within the framework of various action plans have prolonged the all-important liberalization of the global economy. Over the past 20 years, the United Nations has helped to reduce extreme poverty rates by half and increase average life expectancy. Thanks to United Nations incentives, education for the world’s populations has improved. The involvement of the private sector and civil society in global governance is constantly growing.\\nThere is another signal of hope, namely, the recent peace agreement in Colombia. Switzerland, the depositary of the agreement, commends all the parties involved for that breakthrough on the road to lasting peace. Our generation is the first since the beginning of the twentieth century not to have lived through a world war. The United Nations has greatly contributed to that outcome, even if we must admit that there are still too many regional conflicts and that those conflicts have resulted in too many victims.\\nBecause of its universality, the United Nations has a unique legitimacy, which gives rise to a monumental responsibility, with the number of its initiatives, agreements and processes constantly multiplying. A new global vision is taking shape, and all States are involved. Among the cornerstones of that vision is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is the common framework for the development of sustainable solutions. It provides the basis for a renewed social contract between leaders and populations.\\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which seeks to limit global warming, is a strong sign of the commitment of States. The recent decision of the United States and China to ratify the Agreement is a very important step towards ensuring its success. The first World Humanitarian Summit, held in Istanbul, which helped to develop solutions aimed at helping people affected by crises and disasters, is further evidence of international solidarity. Furthermore, the review of the United Nations peace and security architecture, which we recently completed, highlighted the importance of conflict prevention.\\nFinally, this year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Human Rights Council, which has substantially contributed to the promotion and defence of human rights. A further step is now needed to strengthen the influence of its actions on the ground. The “Appeal of 13 June”, launched by Switzerland and supported today by 70 States, rightly proposes to improve conflict- prevention activities by more systematically integrating the human rights dimension, including strengthening the links between the Human Rights Council and the Security Council.\\nIn recent years, we have provided ourselves with valuable tools to build a better world; now it is time to use them. In that context, I would like to express our gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who, during a decade of hard work, has enabled the United Nations to make significant advances. We are convinced that his successor will continue the work and reform of the United Nations.\\nOur approach in this crucial phase must be based on principles that are dear to us, the Swiss, namely, the principles of inclusion and participation. I am convinced that by acting together we will succeed in meeting all the Goals of the 2030 Agenda. Switzerland was one of the first countries to introduce national measures aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda. We are determined to follow through on that commitment.\\nI hold the deep conviction that, in order to achieve the goals that we have set, we must have a sound economy. Promoting sustainable economic growth means making commitments that favour societies that offer equitable opportunities for all their members. A thriving economy is a primary objective, because it is a essential tool for creating opportunities for all citizens. A thriving economy makes it easier for young people, women and older workers to enter the labour market. I see that as absolutely consistent with the commitments undertaken by the United Nations. For a dynamic economy that provides jobs and opportunities is an important factor in preventing terrorist abuses and armed conflict.\\nIn Switzerland, we have identified three key elements that enable us to regularly be at the forefront of innovation and competitiveness.\\nFirst, we have an effective training system that reflects the needs of the real economy as well as those of basic research. University courses and vocational programmes in Switzerland benefit from the same attention and the same care. Enterprise learning enriched by theoretical training in vocational schools plays a central role in the system.\\nSecondly, our liberal labour laws allow companies to evolve with the markets, participate in and contribute to technological progress and easily adopt innovative methods and products. The flexibility of our economy becomes the best guarantee of employment.\\nThirdly, we have in place an effective and respected social partnership that ensures industrial peace. Regular negotiations between representatives of employers and employees ensure that labour agreements are flexible and accepted by all, and meet the needs of industries and regions.\\nBut those key elements cannot produce positive effects without international trade. Exchanges stimulate competition, scientific and technological progress and innovation. And we should never forget that freedom expressed through democracy and framed by the rule of law is the best guarantee in ensuring that a company may realize its full economic, scientific and cultural potential.\\nIt is also important to meet the challenges of globalization in the digital domain, not only in terms of transparency, data security and equal opportunities, but also from the perspective of the opportunities of technological, social, political and economic progress. In an open and democratic society, it is certainly vital that people be able to use digital technologies in informed and safe ways. However, we must also do everything possible to ensure that the new possibilities offered by digitization facilitate access to employment rather than make employment more precarious.\\nIt is easy to forecast that digitization will make jobs disappear. But that is not what matters; the real challenge is to identify the new jobs that it will create. For it is only by making that effort that we can put in place the training that will allow the greatest number of people to find jobs in tomorrow’s world. In order succeed in that effort, we need to engage in dialogue with the most innovative companies. The United Nations and its specialized agencies can help ensure that all countries can take advantage of the opportunities offered by technological progress.\\nSpeaking of the challenges facing the United Nations and the international community leads us naturally to Geneva as an international city. Switzerland is committed to prioritizing that city as a centre of global governance. We are supporting the modernization of the city’s real estate, but we are also strengthening synergies between the various stakeholders in international Geneva, whether in the field of global health or of humanitarian action. There have been a number of initiatives in Geneva in recent months, namely, the Appeal of 13 June to Put Human Rights at the Heart of Conflict Prevention, the launch of a High-level Panel on Water and Peace, the organization of a conference on the prevention of violent extremism, and also various kinds of peace talks and negotiations. They are all evidence of the importance of Geneva as an international city and of Switzerland’s commitment. It is a place that is useful for the world, and we will continue to commit to ensuring that its role is strengthened.\\nI am wholeheartedly convinced that the only viable responses to the contemporary challenges that we face are to be found in collective and solidarity-based solutions. To find such solutions, the international community needs a strong United Nations that is also modern and effective. That is the path we must take. Together, we must now support the Organization with vision and determination.\\n', 'I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Government and the citizens of Dominica and the Caribbean region, who are suffering from the destruction caused by the hurricanes. Switzerland will support the region.\\nSince the year 2000, humankind has made remarkable progress in the fight against these major scourges: hunger, extreme poverty and difficulties in accessing education. But famine still affects 800 million people in the world, and every 10 seconds a child dies from malnutrition. Other challenges include climate change, global inequality, conflict and humanitarian disasters, as well as forced displacement and migration. No country, no actor on the world stage is in a position to find, alone, the answers to the challenges of today. They are too large. They are too complex. They transcend borders, and they concern the entire international community.\\nWe therefore need a forum where we can meet. We need a forum where we can develop solutions and monitor their implementation. We need an actor with the necessary legitimacy to contribute to the implementation of these solutions on the ground.\\nI would like to recall Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. The purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and, to that end, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Collective, not individual. Because I am a patriot and because I defend, as the President of Switzerland, the interests of my country, we need a strong multilateral system. We need a strong United Nations.\\nIn other words, we need the United Nations, and we need a strong United Nations. The fact that we must be reminded of that is a sign that should put us on alert. In order to preserve and strengthen the capacity of the United Nations, we must invest ceaselessly. Switzerland is actively involved in that regard. Investment in substantive issues is a top priority. It is important that we place at the heart of the activities of the United Nations the issues that will be of fundamental importance, tomorrow as today.\\nIn that regard, the States Members of the United Nations have made important strides in recent years. I am thinking, of course, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and of the desire to transfer resources from post-conflict management to prevention, in order to intensify peacebuilding activities. In those areas, it is necessary to make progress towards the objectives set. In that respect, the 2030 Agenda offers a good example. Its success will be measured by the yardstick of its implementation.\\nImportant steps have also been taken within the United Nations. Switzerland welcomes in particular the reforms of the United Nations system that Secretary- General Guterres is working to achieve in the three areas of peace and security, development and management.\\nWith regard to peace and security, Switzerland supports the priority that the Secretary-General gives to prevention for a very simple reason. When a conflict arises, the price to pay — humanitarian, economic and financial — is much higher than the cost of prevention activities. In order to strengthen conflict prevention, it is essential to promote human rights. Switzerland calls on all States to support the appeal of 13 June, which calls for human rights to be at the core of conflict prevention. Increasing mediation capabilities is another important means of preventing conflicts. In addition, the Global High-level Panel on Water and Peace, launched at the initiative of Switzerland, proposed yesterday, here in New York, measures to better prevent water- related conflicts. The United Nations and regional organizations can play a major role in that regard.\\nSwitzerland is actively committed to the non-proliferation and the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the use of which would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences. It is convinced that only negotiations and a diplomatic process will lead to a solution to the security situation posed by the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.\\nTrust is another important aspect. If an actor is to be able to take effective preventive measures, that actor needs to be trusted. For the United Nations, this means that the quality of the partnership established with the host State concerned and its population is of paramount importance. Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse break this relationship of trust. That is why Switzerland supports the Secretary-General’s action against all forms of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation committed by United Nations staff in the field. As part of its commitment to that issue, Switzerland will contribute to the Trust Fund in Support of Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.\\nWith regard to the United Nations development system, we welcome the proposal to further encourage joint initiatives by the various entities of the Organization.\\nAllow me to mention two examples of areas where we face major challenges: migration and digital technology.\\nBy the end of 2016, the number of displaced persons across the world had reached a level not seen since the Second World War. The majority of them have been displaced in their own country. In Europe, for example, we must succeed in finding a solution based on solidarity between countries, and we must stabilize the political situation in Libya. Switzerland is working to ensure that the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration addresses not only the challenges caused by international migration, but also its opportunities. The road ahead remains long. It is necessary that all States participate in that work. We are pleased to be able to contribute concretely to its success thanks to the involvement our Permanent Representative in New York’s as a co-facilitator of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.\\nAnother topical challenge is the advent of digital technology, which is dramatically transforming the world. It represents a great opportunity, but also a cross-border challenge. Topics such as access to the Internet for all and the impact of digitization on sustainable development, as well as cybersecurity, should be addressed together. The twelfth Internet Governance Forum, which Switzerland will host in Geneva in December, will provide an opportunity to discuss those issues.\\nSo as to maintain the capacity of the United Nations, we must also invest in the relevant processes — because the United Nations stands out as much by its areas of work as by its methods of work. Effective and modern management is needed to ensure the robustness of the United Nations system. Reforms in management are therefore essential.\\nIn our interconnected world, dialogue is essential. Dialogue requires the time and involvement of all parties. It has to be conducted on a broad basis and involve all the relevant actors. For example, it appears that political dialogue among States is insufficient with regard to combating climate change. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, clearly show that the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must be implemented quickly. Scientists believe that if nothing is done, such phenomena will become a new reality with which we will have to deal. The private sector, whose role in innovation, progress and development is essential, is involved, for example, in developing solutions, in consultation with the scientific community and the political sphere. Scientific diplomacy and exchanges with scientists allow us to make the right decisions. As policymakers, we must base our decisions on established facts.\\nSwitzerland is firmly convinced of the importance of investing in a well-functioning multilateral system, particularly in an efficient United Nations. Confronted by current challenges, and in the interconnected world that is ours, the notion of “every man for himself” is not a feasible option.', 'We seem to be going through a phase in which we are confronted with hurricanes and earthquakes, both political and natural, upheavals that are getting harsher and more intransigent and belligerent from day to day and from speech to speech. As responsible politicians, it is vital that we ask ourselves how we can bring about a change in direction that will lead to more peace and stability, less hunger and better prospects for everyone in the world.\\nHow do we ensure that globalization will ultimately deliver justice for all rather than riches to the few? One answer as to how we can achieve that change in direction can be found in a report addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It states that we must not limit ourselves to the “traditional questions of peace and war” but must also work to overcome “world hunger, mass misery and alarming disparities between the living conditions of rich and poor”. I find the analysis very apt. The painful thing about that excerpt is that it comes not from a recent report to the Secretary-General but from one that goes back nearly 40 years. Its apt analysis of the global situation can be found in North-South: A Program for Survival, commissioned almost 40 years ago to the day, the report of the North-South Commission, which began its work in 1977. The Chairman of the Commission was former German Chancellor Willy Brandt.\\nHumankind is still dealing with more or less the same structural difficulties today, but it seems to have become rather more difficult to change the world for the better. Looking around the globe today, it seems that a world view that puts one’s own national interests first and which refuses to engage in a balancing of interests among the nations of the world is gaining ever more ground. National egotism, I believe, is worthless as an organizing principle for our world of the twenty-first century. Such egotism sees the world as an arena, a battleground in which everyone is fighting against everyone else and in which everyone has to assert his or her own interests, either alone or in alliances of convenience. In this world view, it is the law of the strongest that prevails, not the strength of international law. I firmly believe that we have to rise up against this world view. We need more international cooperation and less national egotism, not the other way around.\\nSome 40 years ago, the North-South Commission recognized that global problems cannot be resolved through confrontation but only through often arduous efforts to compromise and identify common interests. Ultimately, no country can win if it strives only to assert its own interests. If we all did that, looking out only for our own national interests, confrontations and conflicts would increase and global prosperity would falter. The motto “Our country first” would not only lead to more national confrontations and less prosperity; in the end, we would all be the losers. As Germans, our historical experience is quite unusual. Only after two terrible world wars did we learn to see our former enemies as neighbours and partners with whom we wanted to share and shoulder responsibility for a peaceful coexistence. Only since then have our own citizens in Germany had a better life. We have learned that it was not “Germany first” that made our country strong and prosperous; rather, it was “European and international responsibility first” that gave us Germans peace and prosperity.\\nIn international cooperation, no one loses sovereignty. Rather, we all gain a new sovereignty together that we cannot possess as nation States on our own in today’s world. That is why the European Union today provides the framework for our German policies. The road has often been rocky and arduous, for nothing is more difficult than turning former enemies into friends. Often the way is not popular, and one needs considerable political courage to take it. Indeed, the call for international cooperation and for efforts to balance interests is not always popular in our own countries. However, that courage finally led to peace and prosperity in Europe after centuries of war. Today we Germans are grateful to the courageous people in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and many other countries of Europe for having the courage to befriend us — their former enemies — as new and lasting partners after the Second World War. It is precisely because of that experience in Germany and Europe that we support the work of strong, functioning collective institutions, above all the United Nations.\\nThe urgent need for us to work together to establish a safer world has been vividly demonstrated by North Korea’s current irresponsible actions, which pose a serious threat to world peace. We must send a clear message that the international community will not accept its nuclear provocations. Germany welcomes the sanctions adopted by the Security Council and calls for their speedy implementation in Europe, and we also support European initiatives calling for additional measures. At the same time, we should use all the diplomatic means at our disposal, first to defuse the situation and then to find a starting point for long-term solutions. Resolving this international crisis is crucial because if we do not, others will be encouraged to emulate North Korea. If a country can build up a nuclear arsenal while the international community stands helplessly by, other political leaders and countries will follow its example. That would bring about new nuclear crises emerging all over the world, and our children and grandchildren would grow up in a very dangerous world. That is why North Korea’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is neither a bilateral nor a regional problem, but rather a global challenge that we have to overcome together.\\nWe cannot accept the possibility that efforts to build a nuclear arsenal can be rewarded on the international stage. It is therefore more important than ever that the international architecture for arms control and disarmament does not crumble. Existing treaties and agreements must not be called into question. That applies in particular to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) for Iran’s nuclear programme. The Plan is a way out of the impasse of a nuclear confrontation that would jeopardize security in the region and have an impact far beyond it. However, we can reach the level of confidence that we so urgently need only if all obligations are rigorously met and the transparency we have agreed on is established. Germany will work within the E3+3 framework to ensure that the JCPOA is strictly implemented and upheld. That is not just about Iran; it is about the credibility of the entire international community. For what State would renounce the development of its own nuclear programme if it were shown that negotiated agreements did not last and that a binding agreement with the international community was not worth the paper it was written on? How can we convince countries such as North Korea that international agreements make them more secure and will therefore encourage them to commit to further disarmament efforts if the agreement with Iran, the sole international example of such an endeavour, is not upheld?\\nWhat the world needs most urgently now is renewed trust. With particular regard to the implementation of the ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we have a request for the United States, Russia, China and every country possessing nuclear weapons. They will be instrumental to ensuring the implementation of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of arms control and disarmament. To that end, trust among them must be restored.\\nStatements by Presidents of the United States are always important and interesting, and always worth listening to and even reading after they have been delivered. I found a passage in one such statement that I especially liked. In it, the President of the United States of America called for general and complete disarmament. Every year, he said, billions of dollars were spent on weapons that were acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them. That, he went on to say, was clearly not the most efficient means of ensuring peace. I have to admit that the statement dates back even further than the report of the North-South Commission. It was delivered by John F. Kennedy in 1963. We can see that everything that we need for a safer future has already been considered, written and said. I believe that today we should focus on the bold visions of the North-South Commission and President Kennedy, and have the courage to come up with new proposals for disarmament, arms control and confidence-building.\\nOne of our tasks is to resolve emerging crises early on. A recent example is the escalating violence against the Rohingya people and the resulting refugee flows in the region. We should act as quickly as possible on the issue to offer both political and humanitarian support for alleviating the suffering and ending the conflict. Germany will again increase its aid to the Rohingya through the International Red Cross. We are committed to providing political and humanitarian support, as well as to practical peacebuilding, in many crisis regions around the world. And while military engagement under United Nations auspices is also sometimes necessary, we must ensure that we do not create any imbalances in that regard.\\nTo bring up the North-South Commission again, its report included the impressive finding that, at the time it appeared, a half-day of the world’s military expenditure would have sufficed to finance the entire malaria eradication programme. I suspect that today we would not even need that much. The world’s current annual spending on weapons is just under $1.7 trillion. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 1 and thereby eradicate extreme poverty in the world by 2030, we would need only 10 per cent of that. Sustainable Development Goal 4, on education, would require even less per year. With that in mind, Germany has tripled its funding for civilian peacebuilding measures in the past few years.\\nThankfully, progress has been made in some areas, for example in Iraq. We must work fast to consolidate the successes achieved there in combating the so- called Islamic State by initiating reconstruction and stabilization measures in the cities and regions that have been liberated. Germany has therefore decided to make an additional €250 million available for the reconstruction of Mosul. We cannot abandon the victims of the thugs of the Islamic State. We must help them return to their country. It is also important to strengthen a democratic and inclusive Iraqi State and ensure that the actions of an individual region do not leave it exposed to a relapse into destabilization or civil war. We can only ask the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq not to trigger any new conflicts, which are the very last thing that the country needs.\\nWe also have to make progress in the Ukraine conflict. The Minsk agreements, which Germany played a key role in drafting, provide a clear road map for peace, based on the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the inviolability of borders. If proposals are now put forward for deploying a United Nations peacekeeping mission involving Blue Helmets, I think we should pursue that idea resolutely. While there is certainly not yet sufficient consensus on what such a mission should look like, the idea is worth testing if it can help achieve a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the conflict zone. We would like to ask the Secretary-General to press for the proposal to be realized.\\nThe North-South Commission pointed out that focusing solely on questions of war and peace was not enough. Those issues are also inextricably linked to the fair distribution of resources and to economic and social development and respect for universal human rights. Only a world in which solidarity prevails will ultimately bring us security and stability. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development shows that the international community sees that as a common interest. If we want to make a reality of major ambitions such as peace, security and justice, we need stronger joint international institutions, and especially a stronger United Nations.\\nThe founders of the United Nations were not naive. They had experienced the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century. For that very reason, they bequeathed to us the Charter of the United Nations, with its timeless principles and maxims. But while the principles of the United Nations are not outdated, the Organization has to adapt to the challenges of our times. We therefore support the Secretary-General’s efforts to push ahead with bold reforms within the United Nations. He is setting the right priorities. The success of United Nations reform is largely up to us, the Member States. We have to work together to ensure that the United Nations is more efficient and has greater clout. In my view, reform efforts should not focus primarily on budget cuts. On the contrary, the United Nations will need more resources if it is to fulfil its mandate. We must therefore provide it with the means it needs to be successful. However, at present the figures tell a different story. The World Food Programme currently receives less than 50 per cent of the funding it needs to combat hunger crises around the world. Today a mere 15 per cent of contributions to the United Nations Development Programme are voluntary, non-tied payments, although in 2011 they were still at 50 per cent. The same is true for other United Nations aid programmes, and sometimes the outlook is even bleaker.\\nIt should not be the job of those in positions of responsibility at the United Nations to spend more time sending begging letters seeking the necessary funding than in organizing effective assistance. We must change course and grant the United Nations more freedom with resources in exchange for greater transparency in its use of funds. Germany at any rate intends to maintain its financial support for the United Nations. As the country that is the fourth-largest provider of assessed contributions to the United Nations and that goes far beyond that, being one of the biggest donors of global humanitarian assistance generally, our input is substantial.\\nI believe that as Member States we should now take on another reform project that is long overdue. That is the composition of the Security Council, which should finally reflect the realities of the twenty-first-century world. Today many more States than at the time of the establishment of the United Nations, more than 70 years ago, are shouldering the responsibility for peace and security and are prepared to live up to that responsibility as Members of the Organization. Germany is ready and willing to take on additional responsibilities, which is why we are seeking a non-permanent seat on the Council for the 2019-2020 term. We have clear goals in mind. Peace and security, global justice and human rights are indivisibly linked. We are preparing for reform of the United Nations and its Security Council, and we intend to work in partnership with all countries of the United Nations in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, for we can resolve global problems only if we refrain from focusing solely on national interests and instead work to reach a fair and peaceful balance of interests among all nations. Yes, that is an arduous process. But we must muster the courage to go down that path. For as Willy Brandt, who headed the North-South Commission after he left office as Chancellor, once said, “We firmly believe that problems created by men can also be solved by men”. Let us work on that together.', 'Every era and every decade has its problems, great and small. The problems we face now seem overwhelming. These days many people worry about the future, which is understandable. The past few years have been marked by terrorist attacks all over the world.\\nIn countries like Myanmar, Syria, the Central African Republic and Yemen, the population is suffering as a result of wars and conflicts. More and more people are fleeing their homes because of violence, scarcity or poverty, leaving behind everything they have. Only recently, floods claimed lives in the United States and Asia, and Hurricane Irma has left a trail of destruction in its wake, including in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Nuclear issues are once again a major concern, and geopolitical tensions are increasing.\\nThat is the picture today. But if we take a long- term perspective — and, as a historian, I like to do that — there are grounds for optimism. This building here in New York — United Nations Headquarters — is concrete proof that progress is possible. Here in this inviolable international zone, thousands of people from every continent work together to foster peace, justice and development in a world governed by international law. That is no easy task, far from it. But advances are being made. Sometimes we take three steps forward and two steps back, but if one takes a long-term view, one can see clear progress.\\nThink back to when the United Nations was established in 1945. Europe lay in ruins, as did Asia. Two nuclear bombs had been dropped on Japan. The Cold War was around the corner and would hold the world in its grip for decades. But the destruction caused by two world wars united the nations of the world in a shared belief that it should never happen again.Franklin D. Roosevelt put it this way in February 1945:\\n“The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and of danger. The world will either move towards unity and widely shared prosperity or it will move apart”.\\nThe world of today is indeed a much better world, and not just geopolitically. In 2015 we took stock of the progress we had made on the Millennium Development Goals. Extreme poverty and maternal mortality had been halved, and child mortality had been almost halved. Ninety per cent of children in developing countries are now receiving primary education. Despite all the very real problems that confront us today, I still see grounds for optimism. We cannot change the world overnight, but we can improve the lives of individuals step by step. And we are doing so.\\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in those achievements. The United Nations is the only organization where everyone sits at the table, and remains there. While other institutions struggle with an increasing lack of credibility, faith in the added value of the United Nations remains strong among the world’s citizens. We must not let them down.\\nThe Netherlands and its Kingdom partners Curaçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten have always attached great importance to cooperation within the United Nations. Our small, outward-looking kingdom could not exist without strong multilateral institutions and an effective international legal order. As a trading nation, our prosperity depends on a stable world. And after the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 disaster and attacks in neighbouring countries, the people of the Netherlands are increasingly aware that our domestic security depends on cooperation with other countries. It is very important to the Netherlands and to the victims’ next of kin that justice is seen to be done for those who perished on Flight MH-17. It has been agreed that the next step — the prosecution and trial of those responsible — will take place in the Netherlands. We are working with all the countries involved to make that possible.\\nThe problems confronting today’s world — climate change, migration, food security, terrorism and cybercrime — are by definition international. No single country can tackle them in isolation. We need each other. Instead of becoming more inward-looking, as united nations we need to take a step outwards. In this turbulent world, the importance of the United Nations is growing every day.\\nNext year, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will be even more focused on the United Nations. In January 2018, we begin our one-year term on the Security Council, taking over from Italy. This shared arrangement is a good example of European partnership within international organizations. We would like to see more such cooperation. Our two countries even share some of the same priorities, such as tackling people-smuggling in Libya, an issue that is of great concern to the whole of Europe.\\nFor next year, as a temporary member of the Security Council, we have set three priorities: a strong United Nations and a secure and sustainable world. We will work in a transparent way to achieve that goal, each element of which is equally important.\\nThe first priority, a strong United Nations, is essential. For that, reform and modernization are crucial. As the new Secretary-General, António Guterres, has said, “The onus falls on the United Nations to prove its worth”. He has been active from day one, working to adapt the United Nations to new realities. His ambitious agenda inspires confidence for the future. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports his vision and approach, and I would like to take this opportunity to call for a joint effort to implement his reform plans. It is time to follow through. And I do not only mean the Secretary-General, but all of us here in\\n17-29395 15/29 this great Hall. Saying that the onus falls on the United Nations means that the onus falls on us.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands wants to see a more effective and efficient United Nations, with better cooperation among the various agencies. After all, the fields in which the United Nations is active — human rights, peace and security, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — are all inextricably linked. The Netherlands already works in this way. We call it the 3-D approach: an integrated effort to tackle development, defence and diplomacy.\\nWe would also like to see the role of the Resident Coordinator reinforced. Moreover, the United Nations will have to work in a results-oriented way, adopt a more modern personnel policy and bolster its internal transparency and accountability. Those are all issues that we will press for in the coming period.\\nOur second priority next year is of course security. The key word here is “prevention”. We are not devoting enough attention to the early stages of conflict development. That has to change. We need an organization equipped and ready for action at all stages of conflict. That is already happening in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), in which the Netherlands is participating and will continue to participate in 2018. What is new is that we are using intelligence to carry out long-range reconnaissance missions. In that way, we can anticipate conflict, instead of waiting for it to come our way.\\nWe see MINUSMA as a model for future missions. However, we need not only better intelligence, but also task-oriented training for United Nations personnel, high-grade equipment and a clear mandate. This year the Kingdom of the Netherlands is co-organizing the United Nations Peacekeeping Conference in Vancouver. There, we will press for rotation schedules to ensure timely deployment and rotation of both personnel and materiel. That will make countries more willing to participate and extend the potential lifespan of a mission.\\nCounter-terrorism is another issue on which the United Nations is rightly focusing more and more. After all, the United Nations is the prime forum for global norm-setting and international cooperation in the field. When it comes to preventing terrorism, cooperation is key. A good example of such cooperation is the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF), which the Netherlands co-chairs together with Morocco. There, 29 countries work together to achieve a single goal: to keep our citizens safe. It is producing concrete results. For instance, at least 60 countries and the United Nations now contribute foreign terrorist profiles to INTERPOL. INTERPOL already has over 16,000 profiles. When the GCTF was set up, it had fewer than 1,000. That work is not high profile — most of it goes on behind the scenes — but it saves many lives.\\nThe prevention of violence and conflict ties in with our third priority — sustainability — and with it, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs precede everything I have just discussed. They are the ultimate prevention agenda. They address the drivers and root causes of instability and conflict. Investing in human dignity, eradicating poverty, fostering climate resilience and promoting economic and social progress will reduce the incidence of conflict, instability and despair — development and lasting peace, all in one package.\\nThe Netherlands and its Kingdom partners Curaçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten are working together to implement the SDGs. We believe that the key to success in attaining the Goals is our willingness to form partnerships at the national and international levels with businesses, civil society organizations, knowledge institutions, local authorities and youth organizations. Working together across sectors is part of our country’s tradition.\\nOur most important area of expertise is water management. Much of the Netherlands lies below sea level, so we have centuries of experience in water technology, urban delta management and maritime technology, expertise that we are keen to share with the rest of the world. Working together on water issues is more crucial than ever before. Nearly five years have elapsed since thousands of people here in New York had to flee their homes when the streets flooded in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The destruction caused by Harvey in Texas and the floods in Asia show that water issues have only become more urgent in the last five years.\\nThe impact of climate change on the water cycle is brought home to us every day, all over the world, sometimes violently. The people of Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom, are struggling to cope with the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma.\\nThe United Nations now predicts that 200 million people will have become displaced by 2050 because of climate change. Water therefore plays a key role in achieving almost all of the SDGs. We learn most by working with others and by sharing knowledge. We deploy our expertise all over the world — for example, in projects in Viet Nam, Peru, Myanmar and Bangladesh. That is one of the reasons that I am a member of the High-level Panel on Water.\\nThis Hall, this building and all members of the Assembly represent one of the greatest achievements of humankind: all the nations working together in partnership to foster peace, justice and development in the world. This is a unique Organization, which entails a heavy responsibility. In such turbulent times, the United Nations needs to prove its worth more than ever. Adlai Stevenson, an American politician who experienced two world wars and died when the Cold War was at its height, once said,\\n“The United Nations is like a spade; it is not self- operating. It is what we make of it, for purposes that we can find in common with our neighbours in the world.”\\nI could not agree more. We face great problems in the present age. Conflict and natural disasters affect the lives of many and cause widespread concern. In this unstable world, the United Nations represents stability and a chance to shape the world for the good. We need to make progress with the reforms proposed by Secretary-General Guterres. Let us consider what we have achieved in recent decades. As they say, past results are no guarantee of future performance, but they do represent a promise for the future. Let us do all we can to make good on that promise, because together we can make the United Nations a success. In the year ahead, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will commit itself fully to that endeavour.', 'At the outset, I would like to express our support to the victims of the recent hurricanes as well as those of the earthquakes in Mexico. Such natural disasters brutally destroy lives and dreams and bring about instability and insecurity. Above all, however, such tragedies are akin to a warning shot. They remind us of the utter urgency of the need to work together against global warming. In that regard, I would like to welcome and support the initiative undertaken by French President Emmanuel Macron in the wake of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change aimed at establishing a genuine and far-reaching compact for the environment.\\nUnquestionably, we can no longer postpone what we need to do today. For many countries, in particular the island States in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean, such natural phenomena have an immediate impact on their survival. We must bequeath our children a planet where they can live and breathe, enriched by biological diversity. Let us use the best of our intelligence and our ability to innovate in order to rise to that existential challenge.\\nWe all want a better world. We want to fight relentlessly against all forms of injustice, inequality and discrimination, whether on the basis of skin colour, religion, gender, culture of sexual orientation. And we all want to advance universal fundamental freedoms. When we want the best for our countries and for our fellow citizens, there can be no question of the importance of the freedom of the press and of expression. All too often, elections are manipulated, justice is undermined, corruption is widespread and there is a purposeful lack of transparency. Both national and international institutions must guarantee personal freedoms and work constantly to achieve emancipation and greater dignity for all. Of course, sovereignty must be fully respected, but it cannot be used as a shield or an excuse for attempting to legitimize atrocities or force submission.\\nThis is not a lecture on morals or about dictating, by will or force, a ready-made model democracy. This is about convincing others, through steady and constant dialogue, of the need to unreservedly defend our universal values on behalf of each and every human being, no matter where they are from or where they are going. Diplomatic ruptures have never helped to advance universal values, and abandoning dialogue is often an act of cowardice that also abandons those fighting for greater freedom in their country.\\nWe all want a safer world. Peace, security and stability are the best ways to guarantee that we can all live our lives to the full, having enough to eat, having work, having a home and being able to send our children to school. Yet still today there are too many conflicts, wars and hatred tearing hopes and dreams apart.\\nNo continent is spared the scourge of terrorism. Fomenting hatred and spreading the poison of division is the grim goal of terrorists, whose senseless, barbaric acts of murder destroy families’ futures. None of us can remain indifferent to that, and my country is therefore participating, with others, in the Global Coalition against Da’esh. Military forces on the ground have forced Da’esh to retreat in Iraq and Syria, and we are committed to supporting the countries that have been destroyed in their efforts to rebuild.\\nBut we must always continue the fight to protect our universal values of freedom, tolerance, respect and non-discrimination. Our desire to live together in harmony despite our differences and with respect for each other’s cultures and customs must prevail. In that regard, I would like to recall the wise and ever- pertinent words of Gandhi, who said that if we answer hatred with hatred, we only spread it.\\nAnother threat to world security is the uncontrolled proliferation of arms, particularly nuclear weapons. While the world is in turmoil and there are numerous conflict zones, the most lasting and mutually beneficial solutions will always be political and diplomatic in nature rather than military. The agreement concluded after several years of intense negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue must be safeguarded and implemented. My country has many major differences with Iran but the agreement is nonetheless a channel for dialogue aimed at reducing tensions and threats. It is an opportunity to agree on our goals and deal with our differences peacefully. Rejecting it without proposing any alternative seems neither wise nor desirable.\\nThe situation in North Korea is also enlightening on this issue. In contrast to the situation with Iran, here there was no continuous process of dialogue and negotiation. The result has been a dangerous escalation that is jeopardizing peace and security. We condemn the country’s autocratic and provocative regime, but merely condemning it is not enough. We should all mobilize in order to prepare the ground for dialogue, including invoking the responsibility borne by such actors as China and Russia.\\nEconomic development must serve social cohesion. Growth rates, even in double figures, are not necessarily a guarantee of the fair and equitable distribution of wealth. Capitalism is a means, nothing more or less, for serving social and economic development. We support free trade and we want an open global economy. The free flow of goods, services and knowledge should promote shared development and progress. Sustainable development is not possible without development, and we cannot eradicate poverty without increasing prosperity. Free enterprise must be geared to the true economy, the production of good and services and job creation. We must strengthen the middle classes everywhere. This is not about the survival of the fittest or having the law of jungle imposed on us. It is about distinguishing between investment and speculation. Investment, as opposed to financial speculation, is a responsible and virtuous activity that benefits society as a whole and stimulates innovation and progress.\\nThroughout history, freedom of movement and free trade have brought people closer together. Those principles have been at the heart of the European project for 60 years. The European Union negotiates treaties with various partners all over the world, including Canada and Japan. Those treaties include social and environmental provisions. That openness to the world, accompanied by rules and regulations, is the most concrete response we can make to isolationism and protectionism. History has shown us, time and again, that barriers and walls between peoples are illusory — they always give way to our natural thirst for freedom, openness and innovation.\\nThe 2030 Agenda defines an ambitious framework for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by promoting private initiative, strengthening the rule of law, encouraging education for boys and girls alike, developing agriculture and building on good governance. Those actions constitute the best recipe for preventing conflict and creating a better, fairer and stronger world.\\nCountries in the South as well as the North are all concerned with the issue of migration. Belgium is a land that welcomes people seeking asylum and fleeing wars and persecution. And we will fight the faithless and lawless traffickers who put women and children in makeshift boats to embark on a journey towards an all too often tragic outcome. We must be on the side of those who suffer. Development in the countries of origin is the key. We must invest in the least developed countries. We remain firmly committed to concluding a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration by 2018. We advocate for a comprehensive approach that facilitates legal migration and enables people to return to their countries of origin, while ensuring their individual security.\\nMultilateralism is a robust and reliable engine for building a better world. Coordination and consensus-building are required. However, the essence of the United Nations is sometimes called into question. Globalization generates doubts and fears. Yet multilateralism does not cause such disruptions; on the contrary, it is frequently the best solution to them.\\nWe must respect our independence, but at the same time we must also recognize our interdependence and uphold the virtues of concerted action. We must work tirelessly to build a consensus in which all nations, large and small, have their roles to play and, in that way, have a say. Belgium is fully behind the Secretary-General’s vision for reforming the Organization, not because reform is an end in itself, but because the world today demands more determined and results-oriented action.\\nMultilateralism is a complex task, with occasional obstacles and frequent frustrations. However, there are also successes of which we speak too little. In Colombia, for example, concerted action has put an end to one of the longest conflicts in the world. Multilateralism also requires a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable approach. Prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding must be seen as part of a continuum. International and regional consultation must also be strengthened. As we know, when regional actors and the United Nations are aligned and working together in the same direction, great things can happen.\\nIn the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, the countries of the region have a decisive role to play. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the security situation has deteriorated considerably and the humanitarian crisis is worrying. But even as the debate on the cost of peacekeeping operations has begun, we cannot abandon the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On the contrary, we must support it so that it can anchor itself in an irreversible democratic process, including by holding honest, transparent and inclusive elections. The destinies of Africa and Europe have always been linked. Challenges to one are challenges to the other, whether we are talking about security, migration or even development. We must work to achieve a less complicated relationship, liberated from the demons of the past and functioning on a peer-to-peer level, while we look to the future.\\nIn the Middle East, we continue to advocate for a two-State solution for Israel and Palestine. As far as Syria is concerned, that endless conflict can end only when the international community as a whole shows its political will and develops a genuine common strategy.\\nCombating impunity and strengthening international justice are at the heart of Belgium’s priorities, and we will continue to work for them An example of such efforts is the amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We want to encourage cooperation among States in order to combat impunity for the most serious international crimes. In that regard, we call on all States that have not yet done so to support an initiative to launch the negotiation of a new treaty on mutual assistance and extradition.\\nOur shared goal for the United Nations must be working every day to build an efficient Organization that serves the common interests of the Member States. The key to success lies in the art of compromise and the ability listen actively — and in having the strength of conviction to bring that about. My country’s transparent and constructive attitude is reaping results that benefit everyone. Belgium is a land of compromise. It is in that spirit that we are currently a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council. Based on our international roots and experience, we are ready to assume the responsibilities of building consensus and acting for peace. As the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau said, man can make his happiness only by working for that of others. We stand ready to get to work.', 'I am privileged to address the General Assembly, and I know to whom I owe this privilege. I owe it to all those who, just over 70 years ago, rose up against a barbaric regime that had seized my country, France. I owe it to the nations that heard the cry of those who resisted and that from the Americas, Africa, Oceania and Asia sent their sons and daughters to France to help. Not all of them were familiar with France, but they knew that France’s defeat would also mean the defeat of the ideals they shared. They were proud of those ideals and were prepared to die to uphold them. They knew that their freedom and values were dependent upon the freedom of other men and other women living thousands of kilometres from them.\\nI owe the privilege to those who, once the war had ended, dared to attempt reconciliation and built a new international order. I owe it to people who, like René Cassin, understood that human rights were at the very core of international legitimacy. I owe it to people who brought the guilty to justice, tended to the victims and rectified mistakes. I owe it to those who believed that the values that the war had trampled must be restored to their rightful place.\\nTolerance, freedom and humanity are the values on which the United Nations was built. And it was not because those values were beautiful but rather because they were just and made it possible to avoid the worst.\\nI do not speak of all this merely to talk about history, but because today I hear several of our colleagues talking about the future of our world, and forgetting somewhat where we have come from. What might seem exotic and far removed from our immediate interests is perhaps what determines and will determine most what lies ahead for us.\\nMy country might have a unique place in the international order, but that means that it is also indebted to all those whose voices have gone unheard. I know that the duty of France is to speak for those whose voices are not heard. If we speak for them, we also speak for ourselves — now and for the future. Today I would like to speak for those forgotten voices.\\nI have heard Bana, who lives in Aleppo and whose voice I want to bring here. She has lived under the horror of bombings, of police and militia. She has lived in refugee camps. The Syrian people have suffered enough for the international community to acknowledge its collective failure and to question its methods.\\nTo achieve just and lasting peace, we must focus urgently on a political settlement to the crisis by way of a transition, as the Security Council has called for through its unanimous adoption of resolution 2254 (2015). France and its partners have taken the initiative to support the efforts of the United Nations and to design, finally, an inclusive political road map for Syria. That is why I hope that we can establish a contact group made up of all of the five permanent members of the Security Council and relevant stakeholders.\\nThe so-called Astana process can be useful, but it is not enough, and the past few days have revealed many problems. We have to give ourselves the resources we really need to begin negotiations, because the solution will ultimately be a political rather than a military one. It is in the interests of all of us and, of course, in Syrians’ interests above all.\\nIn that context, I have already stated what our two red lines are. First, France will not waver where the use of chemical weapons is concerned. The perpetrators of the attack of 4 April must be brought to international justice, and that must never happen again. Secondly, it is absolutely crucial to ensure access to health care for all men and women and enable medical facilities to protect civilians. France will make this one of the priorities of its presidency of the Security Council next month.\\nWhen we act to achieve peace in Syria we are acting for the Syrian people, but we are also doing it to protect all of us against Islamist terrorism, because what we are primarily fighting in Syria and in Iraq is terrorism. We are acting for all who perished in attacks in recent months, because jihadi terrorism has struck our fellow citizens across all continents, regardless of religion. We must therefore protect ourselves by joining forces, and security must become our first priority. That is the focus of the initiatives that France has launched for combating terrorists’ use of the Internet and all their financing sources. That is why I hope we can organize a conference in 2018 on this effort, which I urge everyone here to become involved in. It is also the focus of the military action that France has undertaken as part of the coalition in Syria and Iraq, in accordance with international law. We are fighting terrorism not only on the military and diplomatic fronts but on the educational, cultural and moral fronts, too. It is part of our efforts in Asia as well as in the Middle East and Africa. And it must bring all of us together.\\nI have listened to Ousman, a schoolboy in Gao, and I would like to bring his voice in here today. Ousman is growing up in Mali under constant threat from indiscriminate attacks, and yet his only dream is to be able to go to school without risking his life. We are now all engaged in the Sahel — the United Nations, the countries of the region that are participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the Force conjointe du G5 Sahel, and the European Union and its member States. And I would like to pay tribute to all stakeholders by acknowledging that it is an extremely difficult challenge with a high cost in human lives. Our challenge there is, again, eliminating terrorism and, in order to do that, building national capacities so that States can take charge of their security themselves. Regardless of the resources we put there, our collective effort will not succeed if the countries that are most affected are unable to take on their own responsibilities in that regard.\\nThat is why I have supported the deployment of the Force conjointe du G5 Sahel since my first day in office, and I urge everyone here to mobilize collectively to that end, too. This is also why I want to invest in strengthening our support to African peacekeeping missions, because that is the future. We must all give new thought to the links between peacekeeping, regional organizations and host countries. Our capacity to respond to our peoples’ aspirations for peace depends on it. Certainly, a military response can never be the only response. Here I would like to emphasize the importance of a political response, and in that regard I have in mind the implementation of the Algiers Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali and our development policy.\\nI have also listened to Kouamé, and I want to bring his voice in here today. Left on the roadside, he crossed Africa before putting his fate in the hands of smugglers in Libya. He crossed the Mediterranean and came safely to port when so many others perished at sea. The refugee, the displaced person and the person to whom we give the sad name of migrant has truly become the symbol of our age, of a world where we will never be able to halt the march of despair if we cannot turn the roads of necessity into roads of liberty. Such migrations are the result of politics, climate change or ethnic conflict. They are always the roads taken by necessity. Today necessity is a flight from the persecution of which the Rohingya — more than 400,000 refugees, most of them children — are victims. The military operations there must cease, access to humanitarian aid must be provided and the rule of law must be re-established because, as we know, what is going on is ethnic cleansing. France will take the initiative on this issue in the Security Council.\\nNecessity means leaving to save one’s family when war is raging and when international humanitarian law is no longer respected but becomes a tool to be exploited in the warring parties’ strategy of violence, as it is in Syria. It means exile when the defenders of freedom are the first to be targeted by the powers that be. Protecting refugees is a moral and political duty and one in which France is resolved to play its part, by supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees wherever he has to intervene; by opening legal paths to resettlement in areas closest to the conflict zones in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey as well as in the Niger and Chad; and by defending the right to asylum and unequivocal respect for the Geneva Conventions.\\nIn Paris on 28 August, we brought together the African and European countries that have been most directly affected by the migration flows along the central Mediterranean route. We adopted a road map whose priority is combating the smugglers who traffic in despair. We must put an end to these intolerable violations of fundamental human rights by working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration to establish a humanitarian infrastructure and by helping countries of origin and transit to better control migration flows.\\nBut while short-term responses are a necessity for managing crises when we are dealing with terrorism and migration, what is at stake today is our ability to muster the political will to address the underlying causes of these sources of instability. Migration and terrorism represent the biggest political challenges that all of us may ever face. If we are to overcome such moral and civilizational challenges, it will be by pursuing a true policy of development, which is why I have decided that France should play its part by devoting 0.55 per cent of national revenue to public development aid for the next five years.\\nI am grateful for the applause, but I have to temper it somewhat — first, because I know that some people were expecting more, that such aid is never enough, and that France’s response is still not enough, but mainly because it is not money that is the real issue; it is how effectively that money is used. It is what we spend the money on. It is about how we can be better at evaluating and taking responsibility for the money that we all contribute. Of course, I want France to do its part with development aid, but what I really want is for us to bring more innovation and intelligence to our aid, using different methods and taking on greater responsibility on the ground. That is what I want. The challenge we have today is in ensuring that development aid actually reaches the areas where it is needed, simply and efficiently, calculated correctly and for the purpose it was designed for. That was what we wanted to do with the Alliance for the Sahel, for example, which we launched with the European Union, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme.\\nWe also have to set clear priorities. The first is investing in education, because it is education that will help us win the fight against the obscurantism that is bringing down entire countries and regions today, both in Africa and the Middle East. I urge the international community to step up in February 2018 in Dakar when we re-establish the World Partnership for Education, which France will co-chair with Senegal. This is a key struggle for us all. We must give girls and boys the opportunity to escape obscurantism and to choose their own future, not the future imposed upon them or the one that we in this Hall would choose for them.\\nOur second priority is to invest in health and combat major pandemics and malnutrition, because without education or health there can be no hope. In this fight for development, we must also support the role of women, culture and freedom of expression. Wherever the role of women is undermined, there, too, development is undermined, as is a society’s ability to assume its rightful place in the world. These are not trivial issues; this is a deep-seated civilizational struggle. It is our struggle and these are our values, which are not relative but universal on all continents and at all latitudes. Wherever culture is undermined, there, too, our collective ability to rise to challenges is undermined.\\nThat is why UNESCO is today such an important organization and has such a key role to play with respect to ensuring a human face for the world at a time when widespread obscurantism seeks to eradicate its unbelievable diversity. We are fighting so that all cultures and languages can be preserved and so that progress can continue to be made.\\nFreedom of expression, too, is a most urgent issue. The United Nations must protect the freedom of those who think, reflect and express themselves, in particular the freedom of the press. For that reason, I call for the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the protection of journalists throughout the world; neither the fight against terrorism nor the more demanding world we are living in can justify any inroads upon that freedom.\\nFinally, I wish to speak on behalf of my fellow Frenchman Jules, who lives on the island of St. Martin. I am thinking of his house, which lies in ruins, and of his fear that this may happen again because of climate change, which is leading to an increasing number of disasters. The future of the world is that of our planet, which is now taking revenge for the folly of humankind. Nature is calling us to task to shoulder our responsibility of humanity and solidarity. It will not negotiate with us, and humankind must defend itself by protecting it. Extreme weather events are exploding the traditional differences between the North and the South. The most fragile are always the principal victims, swept up in a whirlwind of injustice. We are all affected by climatic changes, from China to the Caribbean, in Russia and in the Horn of Africa.\\nMy country promised, before the Assembly, that we would achieve a universal agreement in Paris. That we did and signed it in this very Hall. That agreement is not up for renegotiation. It binds us and rallies us together. To take it apart would mean unraveling a pact not just between States but also between generations. It can be improved; we can have new contributions and fresh input, but we will not backtrack.\\nI fully respect the decision of the United States. The door will always be open to it. However, we will continue our work, along with all Governments, local governments, cities, businesses, non-governmental organizations and citizens of the world. We have the strength of pioneers, endurance and the certainty and energy of those who wish to build a better world. That better world will lead to innovation and job creation, despite the beliefs of those who see the future only in terms of the past.\\nWe will build such a world right now by making our national contributions, as France has done by adopting its climate plan, which places us on the road to carbon neutrality. On 12 December, we will be meeting in Paris with those who wish to move forward with real solutions by mobilizing public and private funding. Here I confirm that France will play its full role in this respect by allocating €5 billion per year to climate action between now and 2020.\\nOur unfolding ambition is reflected in the fact that this very afternoon we will be introducing a global pact for the environment aimed at shaping international law for the coming century, with the support of the United Nations agencies.\\nAt a time when some would wish us to stop, we must continue to advance, because climate change and extreme weather events will not stop. Our duty of solidarity and humanity will continue.\\nBehind every one of our decisions are the voices and lives of the invisible masses whom we must defend, because we in turn were defended in the past. Why do we not heed those voices? Why are we not focusing on what 70 years ago gave humankind the strength to believe in itself: planetary responsibility, the desire for mutual assistance and faith in progress?\\nWhen I speak of Bana, Ousman, Kouamé and Jules, I speak about all my compatriots and everyone else’s compatriots, because our security is their security. We are inextricably linked in a community of fate, today and tomorrow. Global balances have changed radically in recent years and the world has become multipolar once again, so we must learn anew the complexity of dialogue as well as the riches it can bring to us.\\nOur collective action is coming up against obstacles stemming from State instability. In Libya, six years after the military intervention there, I acknowledge, before the Assembly, France’s particular responsibility to ensure that the country regains its stability. The meeting held in La Celle-Saint-Cloud on 25 July enabled us to make progress on the reconciliation necessary for the success of the political process under the auspices of the United Nations. Together with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, we must succeed in 2018 in organizing elections that will mark the restoration of effective State authority. I will do my utmost to achieve that.\\nConcerning Venezuela, collective action must enable the upholding of democracy and respect for all political movements. We must give no ground to the dictatorial trends that we see today. In Ukraine, too, we must tirelessly work to ensure the upholding of the commitments undertaken, bring about an effective ceasefire and work together with our partners, particularly Germany, to ensure that the parties to the conflict respect international law and end the conflict.\\nMultilateralism is facing the challenge of nuclear proliferation, unable to ward off threats that we believed to be past but that have re-emerged today. Pyongyang has crossed a major threshold in terms of military escalation. This is an urgent, collective existential threat. North Korea has not to date given any sign of wishing to negotiate. Its authorities are determined to raise the stakes. Our responsibility, together with all of our partners, including China and Russia, is, through resolve, to bring North Korea to the negotiating table for a political settlement to this conflict. France rejects escalation and will not close any door to dialogue, provided that the conditions are met for such a dialogue to promote peace.\\nIt is that same goal that impels me to defend the nuclear agreement with Iran. Our commitment to nuclear non-proliferation enabled us to reach a solid, robust and verifiable agreement on 14 July 2015 and to ensure that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons. To denounce that now without proposing anything in its place would be a serious mistake, and failing to uphold it would be irresponsible, because it is a helpful agreement that is vital to keeping the peace at a time when the risk of a collapse into a death spiral is genuine. That is what I told the United States and Iran yesterday. For my part, I hope that we will be able to fulfil the agreement, by working to contain Iran’s ballistic activity and manage the situation after 2020, which the 2015 agreement does not cover. Let us by all means be more demanding, but certainly not by unwinding the results that previous agreements have already achieved. Look at the mess we are in today. Has the lack of dialogue done anything to contain the situation in North Korea for even a moment? What I want for all of us is a world where dialogue, controls and multilateralism provide us with effective, useful weapons.\\nI do not know whether, 70 years from now, a future successor of mine will have the privilege of addressing the Assembly. Will multilateralism survive the time of doubt and change that we are going through? The fact is that we should be remembering the state that the world was in 70 years ago, shattered by war and stunned by genocides. Right now we need to rediscover the optimism, ambition and courage with which we met those reasons to doubt and the faith in what unites us. We must restore our trust in the universal founding principles of the United Nations, which protect all of us and guarantee our dignity, all over the world.\\nBut why have we ended up where we are? Because we have allowed the idea to take root that multilateralism is a kind of convenient game for diplomats around a table, a tool of the weak. That has gone on for years, because we let ourselves believe that our efforts were stronger and more convincing when we acted unilaterally. But it is not true. Because, sometimes out of cynicism, we let ourselves believe that multilateralism could not fix everything, and so we let deregulation of the world take over. We have been slow to address climate change and the new inequalities that unregulated capitalism creates. We have let the voices of discord shout the loudest. And in that game, the loudest voices win. Time and fading memory have made us forget the history that moulded us and allowed the belief to take root that we are stronger without multilateralism. The challenge that our generation faces today is to be able to get our faith back and to show that in today’s world, nothing is more effective than multilateralism. And why? Because every one of our challenges is global — terrorism, immigration, climate change, the regulation of the digital world. They all have to be addressed multilaterally and on a global scale.\\nEvery time we turn away from multilateralism, the loudest voice wins. But it is only through multilateralism that we can achieve our vision of the world, because it is universal, not regional. Every time we give up on an idea — for example, that the situation of women concerns some people in parts of the world but not others, or that equality is an issue for one civilization but not others — we are abandoning the universality of the values that have brought us together in this Organization. In some countries we have already ceded the race to the strong. And that is because, every time, the great Powers, seated around the Security Council table, have ceded the race to the strong and to unilateralism, and have failed to live up to agreements they signed themselves. They have failed to uphold the glue that keeps multilateralism together — the rule of law. That is what has got us this far and can build sustainable peace.\\nToday we need multilateralism more than ever, not because it is a comforting notion, and not because it is somewhere for thinking people to take shelter, but because it is about the rule of law, about interaction between peoples and about equality for us all. It is what will enable us to achieve peace and overcome our challenges. And the United Nations is indeed the Organization that can act in full legitimacy to preserve global equilibrium. That is why I want a more responsible, effective and agile United Nations, and why I fully support the Secretary-General’s plans for the Organization and his ambition and commitment to making it equal to the challenges facing our world. We need to get out of our offices and away from meetings with States and Governments and to seek new resources, so that we can see the world as it really is and reconsider some of the dogmas to which we have sometimes clung. We need a Security Council that can make effective decisions, without walling itself off through its right to the veto when mass atrocities are being committed. We need better representation for everyone here and for every continent. We need to coordinate crisis management better with the European Union, the African Union and the key subregional organizations. That is why France will stand beside the United Nations as it implements reform.\\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that it is only in a stronghold such as this that the forgotten voices that I wanted to bring here today can be heard, a stronghold where there is a place for everyone and where everyone can be heard even by those who do not wish to hear. To them I say that a refusal to listen to the oppressed, to victims, allows their miseries to grow and prosper until the day when they overwhelm all the rest of us as well. A refusal to listen means forgetting that at one time or another in our history, we were the oppressed, and others heard our voices. It means forgetting that our safety and security is theirs too, that their lives are connected to ours, and we cannot remain unscathed in a world that is going up in flames. A refusal to listen to those who call for help means believing that walls and borders will protect us.\\nBut it is not walls that protect us, it is our willingness to act and to change the course of history and our refusal to allow history to be written without us even as we imagine we are safe. It is our sovereignty and our sovereign use of force in the service of progress that protects us. A nation’s independence lies in its interdependence. A refusal to listen to those voices would mean believing that their despair is not ours, that we will always enjoy benefits that they can only dream of. But what if those benefits are our whole planet — what if they are peace, justice and freedom? Do we believe that we are the only ones who should enjoy them, tucked away in some corner? If we do not defend those shared benefits, we will all be doomed. We will be watching fires burn that history will blow back on our own children tomorrow.\\nToday, more than ever, those shared benefits, our common goods, represent our shared interests.\\nOur security is their security, and there are no sides, no division between those who believe in the rule of law and multilateralism and those who believe in a pragmatic unilateralism. That is a false notion. Our real effectiveness is playing out in this struggle right here. That is why I want to join with everyone here today, united in a belief in a strong, responsible multilateralism. That is our generation’s responsibility, if we do not want to abandon ourselves to fatalism. There is only one kind of courage we need, which is to listen to those voices and not to deviate from the mark we wish to leave on history. We must be constantly aware that we must work to reconcile our interests and our values. Our security is the common good of our planet. Our generation has no choice. It must speak for today and for tomorrow.', 'At the outset, allow me to congratulate you, Minister Miroslav Lajčák, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. You are a long-standing friend, and I know that you will be able to successfully carry out the task entrusted to you.\\nMy thoughts today are especially with the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, which have been repeatedly struck by misfortune. My country is doing everything in its power to assist them in those humanitarian emergencies.\\nMy message is simple. In a context where crisis hotbeds are proliferating and tensions are increasing, it is multilateralism that must prevail, meaning cooperation, dialogue and seeking solutions within the multilateral framework. More than ever, multilateralism and cooperation must take precedence over unilateral approaches and national selfishness, in the interests of our common good and our common humanity.\\nWhen facing crises, the world expects a lot from the United Nations. The appointment of our new Secretary- General, António Guterres, through an unprecedented process characterized by greater transparency, grants him new legitimacy that he can put to the service of his work and that of the Organization itself. It also allows him to initiate three major reform projects — as he has indicated, with regard to the management of the Secretariat, the reorganization of the peace and security pillar and the repositioning of the United Nations development system. A rationalization of the latter, both at Headquarters and in the field, is of particular interest to my country, as 30 per cent of our official development assistance is channelled through multilateral organizations.\\nReform efforts must be borne on all fronts and all aspects of our Organization. In that regard, progress is still to be made on the part of the Security Council. It must become more transparent, even though efforts have been made in that area. It must become more representative of today’s world. It is also worth remembering that Security Council membership carries obligations as well as rights. We regret that in the past 12 months we have seen abusive use of the right of the veto. Luxembourg was one of the first to advocate the code of conduct for the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group to prevent crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We also strongly support the French-Mexican initiative, whereby relevant States give up their right to the veto in the event of mass atrocity.\\nFor the United Nations to be able to implement an ambitious agenda, it must have sufficient resources. However, the budgetary situation of the United Nations remains difficult, notably, but not solely, because of the new approach by the American Administration. That may prevent agencies from fulfilling their core mission. Clearly, we need to go back to the drawing board. My country supports the idea of a budgetary compact for development.\\nLuxembourg contributes 1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance. Our annual voluntary contributions to the various agencies is in excess of $35 million for 2017. The funding requirements for achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are enormous.\\nProgress has been made in terms of funding to combat climate change. To take the case of Luxembourg, my country has set up a green stock exchange with a current capitalization of more than €57 billion. We plan to use that model to set up future instruments for sustainable development financing on the basis of a broader range of development goals.\\nAt the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July, Luxembourg presented its voluntary national review for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The preparation of that review enriched the debate in my country, enabling us to mobilize efforts and strengthen ownership among all stakeholders of the 2030 Agenda. Those efforts will translate into the adoption of a new sustainable development plan that will guide the work of the public authorities and that of civil society and private-sector actors in the decade ahead.\\nMy country acts with conviction within both a European and a multilateral framework. The context of globalization means that there is no other choice. That is true in the area of trade, even though bilateral regional agreements may complement that framework. That is also true in a whole series of other areas, above all in the fight against climate change. We are fully committed to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and we regret that one of the major international actors has distanced itself from that instrument. We hope that it will be possible to bring that actor back, as it is true that a truly global framework would not be complete without it. I would also like to point out my country’s support for the French initiative of a global pact for the environment, which will be able to provide a political framework in the future, giving coherence to all existing instruments.\\nIf there is one phenomenon that is more a product of globalization than any other, it is population movements. There are multiple reasons for that, such as demographic pressure, climate change, conflict and humanitarian disasters. Understandable economic motives, both in countries of origin and in countries of destination, are also often the basis for such movements. In any case, that is a problem that needs to be addressed, and it is very useful that it should be dealt with at the level of our Organization. Next year will see the establishment of new instruments with regard to both refugees and migration. The dividing line between the two will not always be easy to draw.\\nWith regard to migration, the current phase has allowed us to take stock of the situation, which does not always correspond to preconceived notions. First, there is the fact that most of the major transregional movements today are South-South movements. Secondly, there is the fact that, depending on the circumstances, many countries are simultaneously countries of origin, countries of transit and host countries. It is therefore an issue that goes beyond a single North-South logic, although I do not deny the difficulties and concerns arising from the European refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. Many refugees were forced to move either due to legitimate concerns for their physical safety or humanitarian disasters arising from conflicts.\\nIn that regard, the situation in the Middle East continues to raise concerns. Beyond the persistent obstacles to seeking a political solution between Israel and Palestine, the situations in Syria and Yemen are apocalyptic, Libya is engulfed by violence and civil war, and new tensions are emerging in the Gulf countries. The international community must do everything in its power to reduce those tensions.\\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict has lost none of its core importance. The total absence of credible political prospects could lead at any moment to a new eruption of violence and creates fertile ground for hatred and terrorism. Security Council resolution 2334 (2016), adopted on 23 December 2016, which again calls on Israel to immediately and completely cease all its settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, is not directed against Israel. The resolution targets a status quo that has become untenable and unacceptable. It aims to contribute to ensuring peace for Israel.\\nThe recent announcement of general elections being organized in Palestine offers a slight hope for reconciliation. We must seize that opportunity, which also, clearly, requires responsibility on the part of Palestinian leaders, and I have trust in President Abbas in that regard. By continuing settlement in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the Israeli Government is directly jeopardizing the two-State solution, the only fair and equitable way to make possible a lasting solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this fiftieth year of Israeli occupation, the trend on the ground is very worrying. But that is not a reason to give up. On the contrary, the international community must mobilize to change the situation.\\nIn Syria, all stakeholders must realize that peace will return only if a comprehensive, genuine, inclusive political transition is implemented. In this seventh year of the conflict, a lasting political solution depends upon the commitment of countries that can exert political, military or economic influence on the warring parties in Syria. Every effort must be made to ensure that negotiations in Geneva under the United Nations continue and make progress. The Astana process alone is not enough. We should improve humanitarian access and extend the de-escalation zones and local ceasefires, which remain a glimmer of hope for a ravaged population.\\nIn Iraq, it was announced that a referendum would be held on 25 September 2018 in the Kurdistan region. Our position is to support the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. A united, stable and democratic Iraq should guarantee the interests of all citizens. The federal Government and the Kurdish Regional Government established excellent cooperation during the horrible military campaign against Da’esh. The differences that remain between them must be resolved through a peaceful and constructive dialogue that leads to an agreed solution in the framework of the Iraqi Constitution.\\nWe have to do everything we can to calm the situation in the region. It also means maintaining and rigorously implementing the Iran nuclear deal, which helps to reduce the risk of proliferation. The agreement was signed not only bilaterally between the United States and Iran, but also by the European Union, Russia, China, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, as well as being endorsed by Security Council resolution 2231 (2015).\\nThat is also important in the context of the North Korean regime’s headlong rush, which is multiplying provocations by accelerating its nuclear and ballistic programme through nuclear tests and missile launches. That is unacceptable and, like many other countries, Luxembourg strongly condemns those acts by Pyongyang. The Security Council has just strengthened the sanctions regime, and the European Union will do the same. Only the determination and the resolve of the international community will bring the regime back to reason, and hopefully to the negotiation table. If we call for resolve, we must also avoid an escalation that would lead to a catastrophe. To reach true de-escalation, we must not close the door to diplomacy and dialogue. The Iran agreement can serve as an inspiration in that regard. It demonstrates that an appropriate policy, combining pressure and dialogue, can lead to results.\\nAfrica continues to mobilize the energies of international actors in the areas of development, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, conflict prevention and combating terrorism. The political and humanitarian situations in South Sudan, around Lake Chad, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are extremely worrying. As in the case of the Sahel and Mali, such situations are often the result of non-State actors, which render a number of mechanisms inoperative.\\nLuxembourg is committed to the activities of its African partners, including at the regional level. We will therefore support the deployment of the Force conjointe du G5 Sahel.\\nIn that context, it is also essential to develop the various instruments of international criminal justice. We must continue to support the International Criminal Court (ICC), whose scope should be extended. I would like to say here how pleased we are that the trend towards disengagement by African States has been halted. Clearly, the scope of the ICC is not confined to Africa, and any such perception should be avoided.\\nWe have supported the international, impartial and independent inquiry mechanism on the most serious crimes committed in Syria since March 2011. We call upon all Member States to participate in financing the mechanism before it can be incorporated into the United Nations regular budget. We also support initiatives on the responsibility of Da’esh for the crimes committed in Iraq, as endorsed today by the Security Council.\\nThe current session of the General Assembly focuses on people and their right to peace and a decent life. Human rights and the dignity of the human being must guide all our actions. All of the situations I have just mentioned give rise to human rights violations. In a cruel irony, those violations are sometimes also committed by those who were least expected to do so. I congratulate Secretary-General António Guterres for having referred the extreme deterioration of the situation of the ethnic and religious minority in Myanmar — the Rohingya minority — to the Security Council. The Burmese authorities must cease military operations and ensure humanitarian access. Ethnic cleansing has no place in the twenty-first century, not in Myanmar or anywhere else.\\nHuman trafficking, sexual exploitation in conflict situations and violations of the rights of children in armed conflict situations are all scourges that are unfortunately still raging. We must not be content with denouncing them, but ensure that we support and strengthen our financial and human resources, including the institutions that counter those scourges.\\nThe right to dignity is also reflected in respect for the physical integrity of women and girls. In recent decades, we have been able to reduce maternal mortality by almost half, but access by women and girls to sexual and reproductive rights in health care is now being challenged in some parts of the world. Every day, more than 800 women and adolescent girls die from pregnancy-related causes. More than 22 million unsafe abortions are recorded each year. Those statistics are horrifying. That is why Luxembourg, alongside our partners such as Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, has joined the SheDecides initiative by providing €2 million in additional funding this year to support the United Nations Population Fund. Women’s health is one of the top priorities of Luxembourg’s health strategy and cooperation. I assure the Assembly that my country will continue to support the access of girls and women to sexual and reproductive rights and health.\\nSometimes defending human rights is reduced to its simplest expression — no more or less than ensuring the physical survival of the population. I mentioned catastrophic humanitarian situations in several countries. Luxembourg responded to the United Nations appeal to the famine crisis in three African countries and Yemen. For those four countries — Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen — my country has pledged more than €10 million in 2017. We are also a signatory to the Grand Bargain on humanitarian financing, which gives more flexibility, predictability and continuity to international humanitarian efforts.\\nI mentioned our Organization and the world. Let me say a few words about Europe. Europe is not immune to the tensions in the international order, or should I say, international disorder? In Ukraine, the past year was marked by renewed hostilities, with numerous violations of the ceasefire, despite the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Trilateral Contact Group. I hope that the Normandy format talks can continue and lead the parties to fully implement the Minsk agreements in order to guarantee the territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of Ukraine.\\nEurope is not immune to the upheavals of globalization, either. It is victim to repeated acts of pointless and indiscriminate acts of terrorism. It is also a place where nationalist movements are fuelled by an anti-immigrant or anti-refugee backlashes. Moreover, sharing the burden of taking in refugees has been far from exemplary in some communities, but also in some States, including European Union member States. And yet, while they were capable of adding momentum to the worst fears a year ago, populist movements are on the decline in Europe, even if they are often an electoral reality. The taking in of hundreds of thousands of refugees occurs year in year out, and there is renewed optimism, including prospects for economic growth. I call for a Europe that rejects withdrawal into isolation, a Europe free of conflict that does not give way to intimidation, not even in its own neighbourhood, a Europe that puts the person at the centre of its efforts and which is resolutely committed to the multilateral system.\\nThe tensions in the international system are the result of major trends such as growing inequality, migratory flows and climate change. They pit two visions against each other — one based on force, the law of the jungle, unilateralism and national selfishness, even nationalism; the other on the primacy of multilateralism, solidarity, universal values, human rights and the rule of law. Luxembourg is committed to the latter vision. The challenges I have outlined need to be tackled in a multilateral system with strong institutions — a multilateral system inspired by the Charter of the United Nations, which enshrines human dignity and the sovereign equality of all States. That is the best recourse for the vast majority of the States of the international community and for the peoples of the United Nations, which we represent here. At its heart, multilateralism is the foundation of the United Nations. To challenge it would be to question the inspiration behind the United Nations — the creation of an international order based on the rule of law, in the service of peace and freedom.', 'The world has never felt more insecure, at least not in my lifetime. Three years ago, when I first spoke from this rostrum, I was concerned about three serious challenges. First, violent conflict had returned to Europe with the crisis in and around Ukraine. Secondly, with the success of Da’esh in Iraq and Syria, radicalization and extremism sharply increased within our societies. Thirdly, the potential humanitarian consequences of a nuclear explosion became a growing concern.\\nToday we still face a violent conflict in and around Ukraine. Acts of extremism and terrorism continue, and the crisis in North Korea demonstrates that the risk of a nuclear confrontation is higher than the world has seen in a long time.\\nWhile we have achieved a lot over the past years, there are still too many conflicts around the world — conflicts that result in terrible human suffering, such as in Syria, South Sudan, Ukraine, Yemen or Libya. There are also new sources of instability, such as in Venezuela or in Myanmar. On a global level, poverty, hunger and climate change, as well as organized crime and the proliferation of weapons remain key concerns. What really worries me is that we seem to have lost trust in the ability of States and institutions to solve these challenges.\\nAs current Chair-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I can see this on a regular basis. This is a dangerous development because there is no alternative to international cooperation. We need only took at terrorism. Terrorist organizations, such as Da’esh, work on a global scale. More than 25,000 persons die each year in terrorist attacks all over the world and almost all of them are the result of extreme radicalization. This is why, as OSCE Chair, the fight against radicalization is a priority for us. We are working on concrete recommendations for OSCE States on how to better prevent and stop radical groups from misleading our citizens.\\nWhat we need to do is to destroy these radical groups militarily where they operate, such as in Syria and Iraq, but we also have to be clear that after our military success, more foreign terrorist fighters will return to our societies. That is why, at the same time, we also have to continue the fight within our own societies. We have to take more action to stop radicals with police measures and prevent our youth from being misled by these terrorists.\\nThe migration crisis is another global problem and source of instability. Over 60 million people are on the move worldwide. No country can manage this crisis on its own. If we look at demographics, we know that we have to act now. In the next 30 years, the world population will grow from 7.5 to about 10 billion people. Africa’s population alone will double from 1.2 to 2.5 billion people.\\nRecent years have shown how difficult such a massive migration movement can become. Over 1 million people have come to Europe via smugglers and thousands died in the Mediterranean Sea. We need to stop this. Uncontrolled migration leads to chaos. Therefore, we need to manage orderly migration and support people as much as possible in their countries of origin. In order to achieve this, we should address three key issues.\\nFirst, countries need to effectively control their borders. Without such control, no Government can establish security and maintain public support for legal immigration. Citizens need to have confidence that their Governments — not the smugglers — decide who should cross the border. Secondly, the business model of traffickers of human beings must be destroyed. Securing the borders is the most important first step. Smugglers cannot sell their tickets to Europe when there is no way to come through. People that are saved shall be brought back to their countries of origin or to internationally monitored migration centres in their region. Thirdly, we need effective support for countries of origin to establish a local perspective for the young generation there. This is why, over the past four years, Austria has doubled its bilateral development assistance and quadrupled its emergency fund. I am pleased that the United Nations is developing a global compact on migration, as well as a compact on refugees. They should ensure a more coordinated international approach to deal with these challenges.\\nCooperation is also key when we address crises and conflicts around the globe. The crisis in and around Ukraine has lasted for far too long. More than 10,000 people have died and 3.8 million people are in need of humanitarian aid. Despite the Minsk agreements, heavy weapons continue to move into the region and mines are being laid; despite negotiations with the Normandy group, the political process is stalled; and despite regular meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group, there is no progress on the ground. The worst thing is that civilians suffer the most. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission is key to stabilizing the situation, but its unarmed monitors are increasingly threatened and, for the first time, the Mission lost one of its members.\\nYet, despite this tragic incident, it is important to maintain the Mission. From my visit to the conflict zone, I know that without the OSCE Monitoring Mission, the situation would become even worse. Therefore, in March this year, the OSCE strengthened the Mission by increasing the number of monitors up to 1,000 and by providing better technical equipment. I also welcome the discussions in the Security Council to increase the security situation of the OSCE monitors, possibly with a United Nations peacekeeping operation. More safety for monitors means more monitors on the ground, and more monitors on the ground means more security for the local population. We are also working hard to find political solutions that extend beyond ceasefires. The goal remains clear — a free and stable Ukraine with good relations with both its western and eastern neighbours.\\nAllow me to turn to another security threat that we must deal with. The risk of nuclear confrontation today is bigger than it has been in a long time. The consequences of a nuclear explosion are extremely grave, nuclear disarmament remains the number- one unfinished business worldwide, and the recent escalation of tensions by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is a clear warning signal.\\nAustria has been consistently engaged in efforts to reduce the risk of a nuclear disaster and to work for a world without nuclear weapons. This is a hard and long road, and we are not naive about that, but it is a goal that is worth fighting for. In that regard, we welcomed the Vienna agreement that placed Iran’s nuclear activities under international monitoring. Undermining that agreement now would weaken efforts to achieve negotiated solutions for nuclear disputes.\\nThe new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is an important achievementin this connection. It is a crucial, positive step to get rid of all nuclear weapons. Today we often hear that nuclear weapons are necessary for security. This narrative is not only wrong, it is also dangerous. The new Treaty provides a real alternative: a world without nuclear weapons, where everyone is safer. The overwhelming support of the international community in adopting the Treaty demonstrates that many countries share that goal. I hope that we will be successful with our initiative.\\nAt a time when universal values are under threat, we need to be strong in standing up for human rights, the rule of law and good governance. Protecting civilians and human rights has always been a priority of Austria’s foreign policy. That is why we hope to be elected to the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021, and I would like to ask the Assembly for its support. I can assure members that Austria will continue to work for effective international cooperation, and we will continue to actively support the United Nations and its new Secretary-General.', 'I am present here in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria. I extend my greetings to the President and the Vice-President of the General Assembly.\\nI am the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria, but I would like to address the Assembly in Arabic. Why do I do so? For one thing, Arabic is one of the   six official languages of the United Nations. I studied Arabic at the United Nations Office in Vienna. Arabic is a important and beautiful language, as well as part of the important Arab civilization.\\nI also learned in Lebanon during the years of war how people continue with their lives despite all odds and difficulties. That is the secret of life. There are men and women from Baghdad to Damascus who manage to just continue with their lives. I totally respect those people. All of us are the offspring of Adam. The offspring of Adam means humankind. In this Hall we have a voice, and we should use it to express the voice of those outside this Hall who are living in conflicts and wars, especially in the Middle East.\\nAllow me to mention the German writer, Bertolt Brecht, who said that there are some in the darkness and others in the light. We see only those in the light; we do not see those in the darkness.\\nI just quoted the German writer Bertolt Brecht, who spoke of those who are in the darkness and those who are in the light. We only see those in the light. Unfortunately, we diplomats often fail to make heard the voices of those who are in the shadows and in misery. Our diplomatic practices all too often favour fine declarations over real actions. I  even  dare  to  say that we indulge in a kind of dialogue of the deaf when we reduce ourselves to a ritual of reading out  our prefabricated notes. That state of mind reflects a loss of the sense of reality. We have lost the sense of any real exchange of views. When we speak, are we still discussing? Do we even know how to look in each other’s eyes?\\nAlbert Cohen, a connoisseur of the League of Nations, the organization that preceded the United Nations, wrote in Geneva his masterpiece Belle du Seigneur, whose main character is named Solal, a gentleman who works as the Assistant Secretary- General of that organization. Finally, that gentleman loses his post of Assistant Secretary-General at the League of Nations because he forgets his diplomatic restraint in the face of the persecution of  German Jews in the 1930s. Has anyone here ever experienced the feeling of losing face when confronted with injustice and indifference? The multilateralism we are celebrating here is a sophisticated form of diplomacy. We have a wide range of instruments: our contracts, our conventions and our declarations. But where is the effectiveness of that multilateralism?\\nAllow me at this point to pay tribute to President Macron’s statement to the Assembly earlier this week (see A/73/PV.6), which contains a very interesting reflection on multilateralism  and  the  rule  of  law. For the President of France, those two things are synonymous. However, multilateralism is often blurred in a merry-go-round of meetings of which certain well-to-do diplomats have made a comfortable, subtle, interminable game that is enriched with litanies and mantras.\\nUnfortunately, we are content with this mantra when we talk about Syria and Yemen. We become intoxicated with words like “reconstruction”, “stabilization”, “constitution”, and so on. But faced with all that, the populations, the children, seek only to survive. They need bread, drinking water, a few hours of electricity and a minimum of security. That is why, beyond those fine phrases, Austria wishes to contribute, as other countries already do, to financing the demining of Syrian territory. And with regard to the greatest tragedy of our time — and here I speak of Yemen — Austria is ready to increase its humanitarian commitment.\\nBut let us come back from the action on the ground to the beautiful Hall in which we find ourselves on  this beautiful Saturday. Multilateralism is based on a diplomatic approach to norms, and it is those norms that\\n \\nrequire us to condemn, in the name of universal values, the use of chemical weapons in Syria and elsewhere. They also demand the absolute rejection of biological weapons. In that vein, there is no reason why we should not categorically prohibit the production and use of nuclear weapons and explosives.\\nDisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control are essential for global security. The fiftieth anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) reminds us of the key role of the rule of law. Despite some success, the NPT has suffered from inadequate implementation. Now, what is the law? It consists of binding rules of an enforceable nature. Like other international treaties, disarmament treaties are not of a moral but rather of a legal nature. We are convinced that if we wish to really move towards nuclear disarmament, the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is of paramount importance. My country, Austria, has been chosen as the seat of the organization responsible for the implementation of that treaty, and we are proud of that.\\nThe destructive power of nuclear weapons has made it imperative that the legal prohibition of nuclear war be strictly observed in practice. We congratulate Latin America for creating the first international nuclear-weapon-free zone.\\nWe all know that, according  to  the  Charter  of the United Nations, there is  no  just  war.  In  1945,  the international community set out to save future generations from the scourge of war. Unfortunately, the United Nations has not  succeeded  in  keeping  that promise.\\nIn addition, the majority of  Latin  American States have, as Austria has also done, recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. That is a necessary condition for maintaining a credible system of international law. Similarly, Austria is a firm supporter of the International Criminal Court. We are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute this year. The establishment of a permanent independent  tribunal  for the prosecution of the most serious crimes was a historic milestone. We welcome the activation of the Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which has been in effect since July and is an important step in combating impunity. We regret, however, that the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court has\\nbeen undermined by several agreements impeding the\\nsurrender of persons to the Court.\\nThe main  purpose  of  the International  Court  of Justice is to foster trust in the international legal system. Secretary-General Guterres spoke at length (see A/73/PV.6) about the broken trust that we face. The most recent example of the importance of trust and reliability in international relations concerns the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which  is politically but not legally binding. The JCPOA, negotiated in Vienna, was the result of effective multilateral action. It contains a set of political commitments and includes, importantly, an independent verification system involving the International Atomic Energy Agency. That agreement demonstrates the importance of pacta sunt servanda — agreements must be kept — which many of us recall from our international  law  studies.  That  is  a  precondition for mutual trust and confidence-building in the international arena. Preserving the nuclear deal with Iran is a matter of respecting international agreements and one, in the end, of international security. If one country that originally committed to the JCPOA can walk away from the agreement without other parties  to the agreement having violated it, mutual trust is weakened. Reliability is key to peaceful solutions of conflicts. That is especially true with regard to long- term conflicts such as the one on the Korean peninsula, where concrete and substantive measures should follow the first encouraging steps. We express our sincere respect for all those involved in that process.\\nMultilateralism has also failed several million women worldwide, as have individual States. Gender equality is about more than legal provisions. It is about daily practice in our  countries  and  societies.  That  is why the fight against discrimination against and improving the situation of women and girls worldwide has been a long-standing concern of Austrian foreign and development policy. Our focus is centred on the women and peace and security agenda, the political and economic empowerment of women and the fight against gender-based violence, with a particular focus on combating female genital mutilation. More than 200 million women and girls worldwide are victims of such mutilation.\\nTogether, we must stand up against that humiliation,\\nwhich is a breach of human rights and an appalling\\n \\nviolation of the physical integrity of girls and women. In 2018, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs earmarked more than €1 million to help victims of female genital mutilation through surgical restoration, as their physical integrity can be restored. Here in New York, I had very constructive talks with the United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF for the purpose of joining forces to advocate for the basic rights and physical integrity of girls and women. We aim to do that not only through conferences and seminars, but also through practical surgical help, whereby help truly becomes effectual. Women and children are also among the vulnerable victims of human trafficking. Illegal migration provides daily illustrations of that tragedy, with which we are familiar in the North-South and East-West contexts.\\nVienna has found its specific identity within the United Nations family, in particular in the fight against organized crime, corruption and terrorism. Next year, Vienna will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Office at Vienna. I am part of that generation of Austrians who  grew  up with the proud awareness of living in a United Nations city.\\nWith this statement, I have  tried  to  depart  a little bit from the usual United Nations discourse. I have refrained from addressing every single issue dealt with by the United Nations system. However, I cannot conclude without endorsing Secretary-General Guterres’ foremost concern, namely, climate change. The global energy mix continues to be dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal. Scientists are working on finding new forms of energy, in particular for transportation. Will we see an increase in electric and other types of engines? Innovation, market forces and political action will decide.\\nIt is in the Middle East that the major oil reserves are located. The States of the Middle East were shaped by the oil business in the aftermath of the First World War. This autumn, we are commemorating the end of the Great War 100 years ago. Let me remind the Assembly that, with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, the new map of the Middle East was shaped by pipelines, in relation to which borders were subsequently drawn. The recent wars imposed on the Middle East were also fought for the sake of oil. Now Syria is a victim of the instability created by all those wars. A week ago, a ceasefire was brokered in northern Syria for the city of Idlib. Five national armies find themselves in a sort of\\nstand-off among millions of civilians and thousands of terrorists, some of whom are European Union nationals, or, as we call them, “foreign fighters”.\\nThe burning issue is how to move from that military situation to a diplomatic transition. The time has come to take courageous steps to launch such a  process.  We believe that there is momentum  for  creating  a new dynamic. We encourage the decision makers  from Washington, D.C., to Moscow, from Tehran to Jerusalem, and from Ankara to Damascus to  seize that very momentum. We have a historic chance, and, there is no other alternative — according to the Hebrew expression — than to sit down at the negotiation table.\\n', 'Yesterday, our Secretary-General provided his view of the international situation and the challenges that we all face (see A/73/PV.6). His view was a mixed  one, to say the least. We are experiencing a decline in multilateralism on all fronts and a challenge to the basis of the international system based on respect for the rule of law.\\n \\nHowever, multilateralism and respect for the rule of law ensure that democracies can play an international role. They are even a prerequisite for the exercise of their sovereignty. Nowhere is the need for and evidence of the merits of multilateralism more present than in common projects to establish and maintain peace. The European Union is an excellent example in that regard. I am part of the generation born in Europe that has never experienced war. It appears that we take that for granted. However, we must not forget that there are conflicts just beyond our borders.\\nThe same holds true in the area of international trade. In that regard, the increasing number of multilateral measures and counter-measures will eventually undermine our growth.  We  are  strongly in favour of resuming negotiations and constructive engagement through the World  Trade  Organization. If that does not occur, all parties are at the risk of losing out. That would entail being open to discussions on sensitive and difficult subjects.\\nSome challenges can be solved only at the global level. Migration is the best example of that kind of challenge. Demographic trends suggest that it is likely that the issue will be on the agenda for a few generations. We hope that the global compact  for  safe,  orderly and regular migration to  be  adopted  in  Marrakech in December this year will provide a framework for understanding the global phenomenon in countries of origin, transit and destination. It should also lead to better management of migration flows at the regional level. In the European Union, we know that it should allow for the establishment of common policies and solidarity mechanisms among Member States with regard to accepting refugees. It is regrettable that some countries have forgotten that their citizens were once refugees from somewhere in the world.\\nMy country has made considerable efforts since 2015 to receive asylum seekers, including through resettlement and relocation mechanisms. The global compact’s comprehensive framework for migration has made it possible to determine what is expected of countries of origin and destination, but also — and this is very important — what is expected of migrants with regard to their integration.\\nThe issue of integration has often been linked to the rise of populism in Europe. Let me inform the Assembly that countries of various sizes within the European Union, including large ones, had populist Governments\\nbefore the 2015 migration crisis. Moreover, those same countries now challenge the founding principles of the European Union pertaining to respect for the rule of law. I would like to note today — and condemn — the fact that some political parties have become successful by exploiting the weakest.\\nOf course, a clear distinction must be made between political refugees and economic migrants. Those who want to survive — those who flee rape, violence, persecution, imprisonment and death —must be able to find safe haven on our continent.\\nWe have heard warnings from the Secretary- General and from the scientific community: if we continue along the current path, we will not achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. We do not  know exactly how much humankind contributes to global warming or to climate change, but we have the facts, which, month after month, year after year, show with certainty that we must act because we have a responsibility to future generations. I can only welcome all initiatives to maintain or restore the momentum of the Paris Agreement, including the Secretary-General’s proposal to convene another climate summit next year on the sidelines of the General Assembly.\\nManaging climate change is one of the most important goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda’s\\n17 Sustainable Development Goals is  progressing well, and the international community is engaged, in particular through national plans, keeping in mind that each Member State is free to focus on its own priorities. It is clear that the issue of financing the Sustainable Development Goals remains a problem.\\nWith regard to climate change, specific mechanisms have been developed nationally and internationally and through the private  sector.  Mechanisms  exist but resources remain insufficient. Luxembourg now has a green stock exchange with a capitalization of\\n$50 billion — the largest of its kind. We also have a goal to create similar mechanisms for other Sustainable Development Goals. However, the response of the financial sector remains lukewarm. That is because, first, traditional operators are unaware of the potential of new markets and, secondly, compliance obligations are imposed on supervisory authorities in developed countries.\\nAs we know, the share of official development assistance is decreasing, and other mechanisms must\\n \\nbe found to shore up the lack of resources, in particular for the least developed countries. The need to diversify the sources of development assistance cannot relieve us of our official development assistance obligations. For its part, my country will continue to devote\\n1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance.\\nLike the majority of countries, we experienced a rather challenging period in terms of budgetary matters. Reducing the budget allocated to cooperation would have been welcomed by some. I mention that simply because, in developed countries with considerable income, we wonder if we should have a hot meal or a cold meal but, in some countries, mothers wonder if they will be able to feed their children at all for the next few days. We  forget how lucky we are. I believe  it is important to share what we have. I know that  there is consensus on that issue in my country. Even after legislative elections in two weeks, I believe the consensus will remain and that the next Government will follow suit.\\nThe effectiveness of development aid is of course not only dependent on financial resources. In that regard, the Secretary-General’s reform of the development sector has our full support. In particular, the policy and practice of United Nations development agencies should be aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Coordination among agencies, the development of joint projects and the establishment of a new resident coordinator system could give us the flexibility and adaptability necessary for the effective implementation of development projects on the ground.\\nI highlighted the Secretary-General’s reforms because we believe that our country plays a special role in the area of development. However, reforms in the area of peace and security and within the management pillar of the Secretariat are important and should receive the same strong support. Such efforts must succeed because they also contribute to ensuring lasting support for multilateral institutions. Reform in the area of peace and security should enable the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping operations to be more effective and flexible, while bearing in mind that deployment modalities do not always meet needs.\\nAfrica is one of the regions where the United Nations is most present through peacekeeping operations, development assistance and humanitarian programmes and projects. West Africa and the Sahel are now a\\nhotbed of instability, terrorism, organized crime and trafficking of all kinds. Only through coordinated and concerted action with regional and national stakeholders and international institutions can the burgeoning number of threats in the region be contained. For its part, my country focuses a  considerable  percentage of its development assistance on countries in that particular region. By way of example, let me outline our efforts in Mali.\\nOur programme for that country has a budget of\\n€61 million for  the  period  2015-2019.  Luxembourg is one of the main donors to the Office of the Independent Observer, responsible for evaluating the implementation of the ceasefire agreement between the Government and armed groups in the north of the country. Since 2012, it has funded the establishment of the International Commission of Inquiry for Mali to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. My country also contributes to the development of a compliance framework for respect for human rights and international humanitarian law to be used in operations of the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel).\\nWe allocate approximately €1.15 million to security and defence. Starting this year, my country has also been participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and deploys army officers to provide air support. In line with commitments made during the Brussels conference in February, Luxembourg will contribute approximately\\n€500,000 in medical support to the G-5 Sahel Joint Force and €600,000 to build a field hospital in Sévaré. Luxembourg’s contribution clearly remains modest. I would simply like to show what a small country like Luxembourg can contribute when international and regional coordination structures are put in place.\\nThe situation in the Near and Middle East, as well as in the southern Mediterranean region of Libya, inspires less optimism. It must be  highlighted  that the stalemate in the peace process between Israel and Palestine remains completely unresolved, and the situation, it must be said, has deteriorated since the last session of the General Assembly. We will never tire of recalling the principles of international law that must form the basis for peace. There can be no doubt about Israel’s right to exist or about the right of Palestinians to their own State. The two-State solution is the only fair and lasting solution.\\n \\nThe explosive situation in Libya is the result of tensions that are specific to Libya’s  tribal structure.  It is also due to the fact that the country serves as a sounding board for tensions in the Sahel and Arab- Muslim worlds. The interest of the international community, primarily the United Nations and its Special Envoy, is therefore multifaceted. The political solution reached among the Libyan parties will also determine the control of migration flows to Europe. It is obviously not a question of locking up the migrants in camps, in intolerable and disgraceful conditions of slavery, in the twenty-first century.\\nThe war in Syria has led to a huge humanitarian crisis. It has claimed the lives of countless people. Half of the population is displaced, either internally  or abroad. After the tragedy of eastern Ghouta at the beginning of the year, more than 3 million people are now threatened in the Idlib region. The means used in the war by the warring parties have been extreme in terms of their violence and cruelty, including the use of chemical weapons, which is both beyond understanding and unacceptable.\\nIt is simply incomprehensible and shameful that the international community has been unable, by means  of veto, to renew an instrument designed to establish the facts and responsibilities for the use of chemical weapons. We hope that the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, established by resolution 71/248, will have access to data collected by the Joint Investigation Mechanism so that it can ensure justice when the time comes.\\nThe humanitarian commitment of my country in the Syrian conflict is by far our most significant and stands at €7.5 million per year for the period 2016-2020, as I personally announced at the conference in London. Luxembourg will also participate in the latest appeal for additional  contributions  from  the Department  of Political Affairs in support of the United Nations political efforts in Syria. It will also provide an amount of €200,000 to allow the Mechanism to be operational. The tragedy of the war in Syria has led to a situation that is all the more intractable, especially since it combines the interplay of powers, regional rivalries and religious conflict.\\nThe humanitarian tragedy in Yemen has caused destruction, displacement, hunger and cholera. The war raging there has also been extremely cruel. We must expeditiously put in place the means to establish accountability and fight impunity. The role of the United Nations, in particular its Special Envoy and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, is crucial if we are to avoid further aggravating the situation and to pave the way for a political solution.\\nIn the two foregoing conflicts, the regional Powers play an important,  although  not  always  positive, role. That is the case for Iran. We share the concerns expressed by the United States and its allies regarding Iran’s  influence in the Middle East, which is  likely to destabilize the situation in many neighbouring countries. From our point of view, however, that does not mean that we should call into question Iran’s nuclear deal, which we believe, if not perfect, provides tangible guarantees in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. We regret that the United States has denounced that agreement, which was the subject of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) and continues to bind the international community.\\nWith regard to nuclear non-proliferation, we hope that the process initiated between the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, with the support of South Korea, will lead to concrete results in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\\nIn addition to the trend towards  unilateralism and the reconsideration of the rule of law, we must unfortunately note a deterioration in the human rights situation across the globe. That is true in conflict situations, where the use of intimidation policies, ethnic cleansing and widespread sexual violence is increasingly common, particularly among non-State actors. It is also true due to the phenomenon whereby the very existence of certain categories of human rights is denied and the legitimacy of certain human rights institutions is being called into question.\\nThe situation of the Rohingya in Myanmar is emblematic of such a development. There is a tangle  of ethnic cleansing, massacres, intimidation and rape, with an entire population forced to flee without much that the international community can do, except to organize reception in a neighbouring territory and to simply note the scale of the disaster. In that regard, one of the positive developments is the fact that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been seized of\\n \\nthe situation because more than 700,000 refugees have been driven into Bangladesh, which is a State party to the Rome Statute. We fully support the work of the ICC on that issue, as well as in the other investigations that it conducts.\\nWe do not accept that the legitimacy and the very existence of the Court should be questioned on the pretext of State sovereignty. In accordance with the principle of complementarity, the ICC intervenes only in the event of the failure of States to act.\\nOur support to the Human Rights Council and its work remains as strong as ever. We see the institution as a fundamental pillar of the United Nations system. The Council can be reformed without challenging its mandate and modus operandi. We have supported efforts in that regard. However, we regret the decision of the United States to withdraw its participation from the Human Rights Council, even though it was an ally in the defence of human rights at the global level. We hope that reform efforts will continue, and we will also contribute to them from within, if Luxembourg is elected to the Council for the term 2022-2024.\\nHuman rights cover many facets, such as  civil and political rights and economic and social rights,    to mention only the most traditional ones, but there is also a new category of rights, including sexual rights and reproductive health rights. We regret that the latter are too often undermined not only in their principles but also in their exercise, including through United Nations programmes and projects aimed at giving women and girls control over their lives and access to family planning.\\nIn that context, my country provides financial support to the programmes of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UN-Women,  as well as the Girls Not Brides initiative, in the amount of\\n€600,000 and €400,000, respectively, for 2019. We also support a UNICEF-UNFPA project to eliminate genital mutilation, which stands at €400,000.\\nThe United Nations gives legitimacy to multilateralism and all other organizations and institutions that call for it. That is why we must tirelessly take up that principle. Only then can we undertake the important work that lies ahead and face the challenges of globalization. A return to the private preserve of nationalism has never been an option for Luxembourg, and neither is it today for anybody — above all, the countries in this Hall.\\n', '“The only route that offers any hope of a better future for all humanity is that of cooperation and partnership” (A/56/ PV.7, p. 2). Those were words spoken from this rostrum by the late Kofi Annan 17 years ago, at the dawn of the twenty-first century. This year, we commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War. Exacerbated rivalries, economic tensions and vengeful withdrawals led to misunderstanding, frustration and hard facts on the ground. Unilateral actions and failed dialogue led to the irreparable wiping out of sacrificed generations, as half of the twentieth century was crushed by the horror of two world wars and the shame of the Holocaust.\\nIt took the foresight and courage of a generation  to provide the outline of an international order based on values and rules. From the ashes of tragedy in the previous century, the birth of the European Union and the United Nations has created hope for a better world. The European Union has enjoyed a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Its concrete achievements include a free economy based on  fair competition, freedom  of movement and the establishment of social and environmental standards.\\nThe European Union is the result of a tireless dialogue that is sometimes complex and often restrictive. That dialogue is based on an ambition that goes far beyond simply adding to national interests. That ambition is the promise of the founding fathers, namely, the freedom and dignity of every citizen, the rule of law and democracy as a bulwark against arbitrariness in governance. Those are the pillars that have laid the foundations for peace and security. The Charter of the United Nations declares the importance of dignity and respect for every human being, regardless of where they come from, the colour of their skin, their origin, philosophical or religious beliefs or sexual orientation. Our universal values are the strongest and most reliable benchmark for addressing each of the challenges that the world faces.\\nDemocracy and the rule of law are always the best guarantees of the realization of fundamental rights and freedoms, because the rule of law is the arbiter\\n \\nthat protects the weak from the strong. The rule of law means that we assume the consequences of our actions. The rule of law is the rejection of impunity. The rule of law is also the guarantee that science and knowledge are better shared among us. Putting human beings at the centre and establishing the rule of law as the basis for international order is what should drive the engine of multilateralism.\\nMultilateralism is not a hollow and meaningless concept. On the contrary, it is a conviction, because dialogue is tireless, including with those with whom we do not easily share the same points of view. That dialogue is key. Multilateralism is cooperation and negotiation; it is the battle of ideas and arguments rather than weapons. Multilateralism is the rejection of violence. It is up to us to be committed to a better, more just, safer and more sustainable world.\\nWho here believes that bringing together the 193 national sovereignties represented in this Organization with each acting unilaterally could miraculously produce a virtuous and effective response to our common challenges? That is an illusion. It is the same illusion as thinking that the invisible hand of the market can naturally and miraculously lead to progress and shared well-being. Capitalism needs rules, and so does humankind. Of course multilateralism requires patient efforts. Of course there may be failures. However, multilateralism is the only way to eradicate poverty, neutralize terrorists and preserve the natural resources of our planet. My country regrets that international agreements, the result of tough and intense negotiations, can  be  swiftly  and   unilaterally  jettisoned.  In  just a few months, the nuclear agreement with Iran,  as well as trade agreements and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, have all been cast aside by one of the signatory parties.\\nTrust and cooperation between sovereign nations implies respect for the promises and  commitments that have been made. History has always shown that the law of the survival of the fittest does not protect anyone; quite the opposite. The most lasting solutions are always those that are balanced and widely accepted. As we know, Iran was on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons and, as we  know,  the negotiations on the problem were long and difficult in reaching a compromise. It took reciprocal courage to overcome deep mistrust and hostility, and we know that the agreement is not perfect, given that it does not cover Iran’s ballistic programme. At the same time, the\\ninspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirm that Iran has been fulfilling its commitments. Should the agreement be thrown aside owing to its imperfection? Should we not open a new chapter of multilateral negotiations to complement and improve that agreement?\\nUnilateral, brutal and unpredictable actions make the world more dangerous. They result in imbalance and frustration and serve as seeds of conflict. On the other hand, we are made stronger by dialogue and negotiation with mutual respect. Dialogue helps us to deal with and resolve our disagreements and offers better results. For 70 years, the United Nations has persistently worked to improve the world, based on a common foundation of fundamental values. It is our duty to identify the challenges, develop strategies and, especially, to act. Our Organization has immeasurable potential, and in that connection I would like to commend the intelligent, energetic and tireless work of Secretary-General António Guterres.\\nThroughout its history, my country has been committed to working for peace and building consensus. In that strong conviction, Belgium has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the next two years. We will live up to the confidence placed in us. We will ensure that we foster dialogue with all actors. We want to promote a respectful and transparent debate so as to inspire a greater spirit of trust among us. We will work for security, prosperity and respect for our planet.\\nCollective security is the ultimate requirement, and it is just common sense to seek to prevent conflict whenever possible. That is why we support the permanent monitoring of all indicators of  violence. We are also in favour of setting up early-warning mechanisms, because serious violations of human rights should never leave us indifferent. The manipulation or rigging of elections, violations of territorial integrity and threats of the use of force are always early-warning signs of future conflict. The search for a peaceful and political solution must always be at the heart of our approach, and peacekeeping operations must always be part of a credible political framework.\\nFinally, let us be honest with each other. The presence of Blue Helmets on the ground must not become a smokescreen for political resignation, either in conflict zones or at the regional or international level. Every peace mission must be regularly evaluated\\n \\nagainst the yardstick of its contribution to realizing the political goal in the noble sense of that term. During our time as a member of the Security Council, we would also like to focus on protecting the most vulnerable in armed conflicts. In our view, the protection of civilians, especially children, as well as ensuring dignity and respect for women and the safety of schools, hospitals and humanitarian channels, are the essential priorities. We cannot tolerate the intolerable. Those who flout, often cynically, those fundamental principles of international humanitarian law must be punished. The fight against impunity must also seek to create the conditions for living together in peace after the conflict. Living together in peace and harmony is an existential issue in the Near East and Middle East. The tragedies that we are witnessing in Syria, Libya and Yemen remind us of the long road still to be travelled. We cannot allow regions to become arenas for the cruel and deplorable battles of warring nations, with no regard for the humanitarian tragedies that subsequently ensue.\\nTwenty-five years after the signing of the Oslo Accords, the peace process in the Middle East remains at a standstill. The excitement generated by some developments, which often contradict international law, only creates further obstacles and difficulties and dims hopes for peace. We maintain our support for the two- State solution, with the two States living side-by-side in peace and security, with Jerusalem as a shared capital.\\nThe proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction poses a serious threat to the future of humankind. We will remain fully engaged in non-proliferation efforts.\\nWe want a more prosperous world, with more shared development and the freedom to be entrepreneurial and to innovate, create and  trade. The development  of science and knowledge and the rejection of obscurantism are always the basis for  development and the improvement of living conditions. The digital economy and the artificial-intelligence revolution bring with them fears and uncertainties, but above all they offer new opportunities for a better world, if those advances are designed to serve everyone.\\nWe must also ensure that we, always and everywhere, encourage efforts to promote good governance, transparency and the fight against corruption. For centuries, trade has promoted peace among peoples. Trade develops mutual understanding, respect for cultures and traditions, sharing and the\\nexchange of experiences. Trade leads to prosperity. Prosperity leads to peace. Freedom of trade must be based on healthy and fair competition and a shared level playing field, with ambitious and reciprocal social and environmental standards. In that respect, the recent trade agreement between the European Union and Canada, concluded despite much resistance, including in my own country, offers such guarantees. I am delighted with the impressive and rapidly achieved results, with jobs and investment at its heart, leading to better social protection and therefore more freedom.\\nBefore 2050, the African continent is expected to have a population of 2.5 billion. One in four human beings will therefore be African. For a long time, my country has been advocating for a new, more global, dynamic and ambitious partnership with the African continent. We know how much potential there is in Africa. Energy, agriculture, infrastructure and digital technology offer areas of opportunity for the future. I want to make a strong appeal here for a sacred Africa- Europe alliance — a strong and sustainable alliance for the development of both continents in the service of our peoples, an alliance for investment, trade and jobs in Africa and Europe.\\nI say to our African friends that it is up to us, that we should turn the page on the antagonisms of the past. Let us heal ancient wounds. Let us forge a partnership free of nostalgia or guilt. And above all, let us dare to renounce charity, which eases the conscience but also entails a dose of humiliation. Let us draw up a peer- to-peer strategy based on the shared values of the rule of law, democracy and respect for our fellow citizens. In ten years, we can, if we wish, build an unequalled and unprecedented area of prosperity. I advocate a very ambitious free-trade agreement, from continent to continent, a global and reciprocal partnership, a win-win situation for all.\\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets out the path for a better and fairer world, and everything is there — poverty eradication, access to health and education, gender equality and the fight against global warming. The only possible option is the general mobilization and ownership of this joint programme. All of us, at all levels, let us roll up our sleeves, decide and act, because the countdown is on. There is urgency about this, and the results are fundamental.\\nClimate change is not constrained by borders. Natural resources are limited and the number of people\\n \\non Earth is constantly increasing. The stubbornness of some in denying the reality of climate change is of the same order as the stubbornness of those who in the past denied that the Earth was round. Prosperity must be sustainable. It can no longer be based on a frenetic and selfish exploitation of our precious natural resources. Oceans, biodiversity, air quality and health are precious assets that must be cherished and respected.\\nNatural disasters are falling on us one after another and are ever more spectacular, ever more deadly. Just a few weeks ago in India, in Kerala, unprecedented floods forever shattered the fate of 450 people, displacing a million others who had been displaced and are now homeless. The harmful effects of climate change are going to cause or aggravate conflicts. In West Africa, for example, access to water is leading to increasing tensions between herders and farmers, with the risk of escalation on the basis of ethnicity and identity. Faced with that existential challenge for our children, our responsibility is shared. Alone, we can do nothing. Together, we can do anything.\\nThe Paris Agreement on  Climate  Change  must be implemented. We must, of course, give up certain habits. We need to change our behaviours. But it will be worth doing, because the future of humankind is at stake here.\\nThroughout history, human beings have always migrated. Our host country here is a great example. Men and women  from elsewhere, seeking to discover a new world, have built  a  free  and  prosperous nation. This year, we recorded the highest number of migrations ever. It is not a question of being for or against an unavoidable phenomenon. The issue is about whether we can manage it in an orderly way so as to reduce fears, tensions and conflicts. We must first pull migration out of the claws of smugglers and traffickers in human beings, the abject slavers of modern times. We must also reject the trap of deliberate confusion fomented by populists on all sides, whether from the far left or the far right.\\nMy country intends to continue to  fully assume its responsibility to humankind. During the past three years, we have granted international protection to nearly 45,000 people, and that is many more than in the past. I am also in favour of an effective policy of return for those who do not meet the conditions set forth at the international level.\\nFinally, it needs to be said that the time has come to pursue legal and orderly forms of international mobility, for example, to enable students to get an education and then return home, or for other economic reasons. In December, in Marrakech,  my  country  will sign the global pact on migration, because that document is a step in the right direction. It clarifies the various concepts and could be a lever for the future and for a more organized and controlled management of international mobility. Indeed, we can say that extremists on all sides and human traffickers are in  the same boat. The former instrumentalize and fuel the migration issue for electoral and political purposes, the latter for low financial purposes.\\nIn conclusion, peace is our most precious asset. History has always shown that peace requires courage and vigilance at all times, and that no continent or country is immune to the poison of the fear of others, or of hatred or selfishness. We all come from different backgrounds, with our histories, our cultures, our traditions, but also with our emotions, which stem from the roots of our past. The demands of memory must serve our lucidity. The demands of memory must rally our energy so  that it  can rise to the challenges of this century. Those challenges know no borders. Development, the fight against terrorism, climate change, are all problems that no country, regardless of its economic or political power, will be able to overcome by itself.\\nBeyond our many differences, we will always share a common feature, our humanity. Every human being, by the simple fact of his or her birth, must be free. That being’s dignity must be recognized and respected. It is a pivotal value, and the fundamental condition for making the world progress unflaggingly towards greater hope and optimism. Our method is based on our faith in a committed, creative, invigorating multilateralism. We reject all forms of inertia and resignation, because we believe that the best is within us.\\n“Law and order rather than violence; tolerance rather than selfishness; knowledge rather than obscurantism; respect for others rather than hatred or fear”: that is my country’s credo. Belgium is a loyal, solid and reliable partner. We will spare no effort to make the world a safer, more sustainable and, above all, more just place.\\n', 'All of us here are heirs to the great hope to save future generations from the scourge of war, to build an international order based on law and respect for one’s word, and to lead humankind towards economic, social and moral progress in increasingly secure freedom. We have seen results. The enjoyment of human rights has spread, trade and prosperity have grown, and poverty has declined. That has been our achievement of the past several decades.\\nWe must, however, look honestly at the moment in which we are living. We are experiencing today a deep crisis in the liberal Westphalian international order, which we have known. First, that is because, in part,  it has failed to regulate itself, and to date no solution commensurate with the task of meeting its economic, financial, environmental and climatic failures has been found. Secondly, it is because our collective capacity to\\n \\nrespond to crises too often continues to be hindered by divisions within the Security Council. Our Organization is too often reduced to deploring the violations of rights that it has pledged to guarantee. Seventy years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly in Paris, a cultural, historical and religious relativism is now challenging the foundations of their universality.\\nBorn of hope, the United Nations can become, like the League of Nations that  preceded  it,  the  symbol of powerlessness. We need not look far to see who is responsible for that crime. They are in this Assembly Hall. They are speaking today. We, the leaders, are responsible. On that basis, I see three main paths for us to follow.\\nThe first path is to think that this is just a passing moment, a historical parenthesis before we return to life as normal. I do not believe that to be the case. I do not believe it because we are going through a crisis of effectiveness and principles in our contemporary world order, which will not be able to restore its previous landmarks and modes of functioning. This moment in time is not a parenthesis; it is a manifestation of our own failures of the past.\\nThe second path would be that of the law of the strongest. Everyone is tempted to follow their own law. That path — the path of unilateralism — leads directly to isolation and conflict, to widespread clashes with everyone pitted against each other, to the detriment of all, even ultimately those who believe themselves to be the strongest. The responsibility for peace cannot be delegated; it cannot be refused; it cannot be pre-empted. It must be exercised collectively.\\nThe law of the strongest does not protect any people from any threat, be it chemical or nuclear. What will truly resolve the situation in Iran and what has already begun to stabilize it? Was it the law of the strongest, the pressure of one individual? No. We know that Iran was on the path to military nuclear power, but what stopped it was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed in Vienna in 2015. Today, as I said a year ago (see A/72/PV.4), we must not exacerbate regional tensions, but rather put forth a broader agenda that addresses all the nuclear, ballistic and regional concerns caused by Iranian policies. We must do so through dialogue and multilateralism, without naivety or complacency, but also without posturing, which would be pointless.\\n The problem of trade imbalances and their consequences for our societies will be solved by common rules adapted to today’s reality that make it possible to ensure fair competition on an equal footing, and under no circumstances will a bilateral approach to all our trade disputes or new protectionism do so.\\nWhat will resolve the crisis between Israel and Palestine is definitely not unilateral initiatives, or ignoring Palestinians’ legitimate right to  lasting peace, or underestimating Israelis’ legitimate right to their security. There is no credible alternative to two States living side by side in peace and security, with Jerusalem as their capital. Israel knows that France is unwavering in its friendship, and it is in the name of that friendship that I call for a quick end to the policy of faits accomplis that threaten the very possibility of reaching a peace agreement. Continuing along that path would be a mistake. On that issue, I am ready, and we must all stand ready, to move beyond dogmas and historical positions in order to take new initiatives, on the condition that it leads to positive changes on the ground. There too, the law of the strongest will only exacerbate frustration and violence. As the Assembly has seen, in the face of  contemporary imbalances, I  do not believe in the law of the strongest, even if it is masked in a form of legitimacy where it has actually lost all claims to legality.\\nI believe that there is a third possible path ahead of us, probably the most difficult and the most demanding, which requires us to forge a new model and to find a new global balance together. After the Second World War, a balance was built bloc by bloc over the course of decades. Then there was the emergence of a model based on hyperpower. For several years now, we have witnessed a new global instability characterized by the return of multiple centres of power.\\nThe new balance that we must create must be based on new forms of regional and international cooperation and will, in my opinion, be structured around three principles. The first is respect for sovereignty, which is at the very heart of the Charter of the United Nations. The second is the strengthening of our regional cooperation. The third is the provision of more robust international guarantees or safeguards. It is through that method, and on the basis of those three principles, that we must manage contemporary crisis situations.\\nIn Syria, we are pursuing the fight against Islamist terrorism. The military engagements of some countries\\n \\nhave allowed the regime to recover at the expense of crimes for which those responsible will one day have to account. The Syrian people have, tragically, paid the price, and there will be no winners in a Syria in ruins. What is needed now is to win peace under the auspices of the United Nations. We cannot decide for the Syrian people, but we must rather build the ways and means of the method that I have just defined and thereby build a solution supported not only by the Astana guarantors, but also by other States of the region and the international community through the Small Group on Syria, under the coordination of the United Nations and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in order to create the means both to resolve the humanitarian crisis and to build an inclusive, lasting political solution through constitutional reform and the holding of free elections. That is what it means to truly respect Syrian sovereignty. It is neither a substitute for the Syrian people in deciding who should be their leader nor an agreement to cover all crimes by accepting that this leader will remain until the end of time, considering that all principles and, ultimately, all law have been cast aside.\\nIn Libya, too, it is that new method that should enable us to achieve a lasting solution. The current status quo allows militias and traffickers to gain ground, which destabilizes the entire region. We will not give the Libyans a way out of the crisis if we remain divided and if Libya becomes a stage, as it still is too often, for confrontations among  foreign  influences. In Paris, the Libyans recently pledged to hold early elections, which will make it possible to reunify State institutions. Those commitments must be fulfilled under the auspices of the United Nations and in close cooperation with the African Union. Yesterday, an important step was taken that I wish to  commend here. It is in the interests of Libyans, their neighbours, Europeans and the international community, who must be united around those objectives to move forward in that way.\\nWe are all strong together in the face of terrorism when States are able to count on their own forces to ensure their security and when such security is based on regional and international solutions, in accordance with the principle I have justset out. That is the decision taken by the States of the Sahel, acting together in the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel. That was also the essence of the process launched by the African Union to better assume its responsibilities by deploying\\nAfrican peacekeeping operations. That is the essence of the initiatives undertaken in the Lake Chad region, together with Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon, with the support of the African Union. That is why we must support the African Union’s initiative and push for better coordination between the African Union and the United Nations. I hope that, by the end of the year, a resolution can be adopted to that effect.\\nWe are strong in the face of terrorism when we take joint responsibility to fight all its forms of financing, and when, as we do in the Alliance for the Sahel, we act together for development, agriculture and education, and against the root causes of despair that have allowed terrorists to win hearts and minds. Some $7.5 billion has already been committed to 500 projects defined jointly with all the States concerned and the partners of the Alliance for the Sahel. We must consolidate those initial results.\\nAs is evident from each of these crises, the answer has not been to leave States alone, to act for them or to proclaim from here the law or solution to be applied, but to know how to conscientiously articulate the principles of the sovereignty of peoples, regional cooperation and the real commitment of the international community. Those three principles form the basis for modern solutions. Only collective action can preserve the sovereignty and equality of the peoples that have given us a mandate. We also need collective action in the face of the demographic, climate and digital challenges before us, which none of us can face alone.\\nConfronted with the great challenges posed by migration, I do not believe in talk of unconditional openness, which only sparks concern and stokes intolerance. Nor do I believe in the misleading speeches of those who claim, for example, in Europe as elsewhere, that they will be safer behind the protection of a closed border. That is not true. The only effective way to manage the migratory flows affecting all our continents in an organized and controlled manner is to create the conditions for elective rather than forced international mobility, to work together — countries of origin, transit and destination — to address the  root  causes of migration, especially for its victims, to dismantle trafficking networks that are the worst scourge of this phenomenon, and to protect our borders in a respectful manner while ensuring compliance with international law and, in particular, the unconditional protection of those who are entitled to asylum. That is what we have decided to do together through the United Nations pact\\n \\nthat is to be adopted in Marrakech in December, which I support.\\nWith regard to climate change, too, there are no free rides or easy solutions either. Even those who have challenged that reality suffer its consequences like everyone else. Extreme weather events are now a daily occurrence. And by weakening collective action, some only expose themselves further.\\nAs for the great digital transformation, here too our duty is to stand together to build modern rules that will allow us to reconcile the development of artificial intelligence with our ethical rules in order to support the digital transformation of our societies.\\nI firmly believe in the sovereignty of peoples, which today is strong and demanded by all our peoples in the international arena. It also enjoys enhanced cooperation in many forms and a renewed legitimacy of international commitment. The great fight of our elders was achieving peace, and this remains one of our responsibilities. We will win that fight in the twenty- first century only by restoring a robust multilateralism that is truly capable not only of resolving conflicts pragmatically but, also and more broadly, of addressing their causes.\\nTo tell the truth, I do not believe in one great globalized people. That is an illusion. It does not exist. But I do believe in universal values, and on that point we must not compromise. It is not the same thing. I believe in the non-negotiable defence of our values: human rights, the dignity of individuals and gender equality. I believe in our ability to strike a balance that respects peoples and cultures by refusing to negotiate those universal values. That is the reality, and I will in no way leave the principle of the sovereignty of peoples in the hands of nationalists or those who today, before the international community, advocate withdrawal and wish to exploit the sovereignty of peoples to challenge the universality and strength of our values, thanks to which we are all gathered here together in this Hall.\\nAll of us here, even those who criticize it, have benefited from the structuring of the international order that has accompanied globalization. We have enjoyed a period of humanism and have all played a role in making it happen. Today, we must tackle the root causes of our imbalances. Together, we must face the weaknesses of our international order and, beyond the crises I have just mentioned, consider the deep inequalities that have taken root. In my view, that is the\\nheart of our problem today. What awakens nationalism? What gives rise to doubt in our Assembly? What gives rise crises everywhere? It is those deep inequalities that we have failed to address.\\nTen years ago, when the international financial crisis hit, we took emergency action, but we did not solve the root cause. We did not curb the trend of hyperconcentration of wealth on our planet, and we did not truly provide a response to all those left behind by globalization. All those who were marginalized now hold a grudge because of the humiliations they suffered or have been plunged into despair, for which we are now collectively paying the price. We owe all those people a response.\\nWe owe a response to the 265 million children who do not have access to school, more than half of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, and to the young girls who have equal access to education in less than 40 per cent of countries.\\nWe owe a response to the 700 million children who live in the regions most exposed to the consequences of climate change — the victims of floods, droughts, rising sea levels and the depletion of resources.\\nWe owe a response to the 200 million women who do not have  access to contraception, to the more than 1 billion women who are not protected by law if they are victims of violence in their homes, and to all women whose global average pay is 23 per cent less than men and up to 40 per cent in rural areas.\\nWe owe a response to the 783 million people living below the poverty line, to those suffering from hunger or chronic malnutrition and to those who do not have access to basic health care.\\nWe owe a response to the aspirations of the most important generation of young people in history — our own young people — amounting to nearly 2 billion people who are now between the ages of 10 and 24, and 90 per cent of whom live in developing countries.\\nWe owe a response to all those who look to us because their destiny depends on what we are or are not able to do here together in the Assembly.  And those who forget that we owe an answer to all those people are wrong because they are sowing the seeds for tomorrow’s crises and because they will leave their children and ours in a much worse situation than we are in today.\\n \\nWe have made great progress in reducing inequalities among our countries, and we  have created the framework for  that in the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development, but the fight is not behind us. It is far from over. Wealth per capita is 50 times higher in the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development than in low- income countries. Do we think that we can sustainably increase stability and balance in this state of affairs? No, we must take action. That is why, as I announced here last year (see A/72/PV.4), I have decided to increase France’s official development assistance by\\n€1 billion starting in 2019. Our humanitarian funding will increase by 40 per cent. But it is also why the fight against inequality will be the priority of the French presidency of the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in 2019. After Canada, whose leadership I applaud, France will assume the G-7’s next presidency. I would like to have a major reconsideration of its format in order to improve its association with various other Powers and devise new ways to coordinate.\\nI also wanted it to be at the United Nations that I made the first announcement that the inequality agenda will be at the centre of the next G-7, and also that I intend to report on the results of the Biarritz G-7 next September, because the time when a club of rich countries could define the balances of power in the  world  by  itself has long since passed and because it is impossible to separate the fate of each of its members from that of all the States members of the Assembly. We must tackle modern inequalities today because they are at the root of the evil that I denounced at the beginning of my statement. We must address inequalities of opportunity, which are a moral aberration and an unsustainable reality. We cannot accept a world in which people do not have the same opportunities because of the country where they were born, or cannot go to school in certain countries because they are women, or do not have access to basic services.\\nWe kept the commitment made here last year with the President of Senegal. The Global Partnership for Education Financing Conference, held in February in Dakar, raised $2.5 billion to increase access to education around the world. That is a historic amount. France has increased its contribution tenfold. The mobilization of the G-7 already begun under the Canadian presidency should make it possible to go even  further. We  are at a key moment on  this issue that will decide whether or not we are capable of dealing with the challenge we\\nface. Between now and 2030 there will be 620 million more children needing schooling worldwide, including 444 million Africans. Are we going to provide for that? Are we going to give them all that they need for a solid foundation that will enable them to be agents for their own lives, to live as brothers in tomorrow’s world? If not, what kind of world are we creating? That is why I have committed France to this fight and why I insist so much on teacher training, vocational training and gender equality in education. That is why I urge everyone here to join in this great global surge for education. Education and health will not only be the pillars of our societies in the twenty-first century, they will be the fundamental building blocks of our economies.\\nWe must also fight diligently against gender inequality. In France I have made this the signature issue of my five-year term, and I am launching an appeal here to make it a major global issue. Women and girls are the first of us to be affected by poverty, conflict and the consequences of global warming. They are the primary victims of gender-based and sexual violence, which too often hinders their freedom of movement and their ability to work and have control over their bodies. It is our responsibility in the twenty- first century to put an end to such violence, from street harassment to femicide. It is time for our world to stop victimizing women and finally make a place for them, one that they deserve, one where they can be leaders. We must ensure that they have access to education, health care, employment and economic and political decision-making everywhere, and we must fight all forms of violence against them. France therefore proposes to those Governments that want to move forward with us the creation of a coalition for enacting new legislation on equality between women and men. Fifty per cent of our development assistance will be devoted to projects aimed at reducing gender inequality.\\nWe must also mobilize against health inequality at the international level. In Lyon in 2019 we will host the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Replenishment Conference. We will take up the initiative on the fight against counterfeit medicines and will intensify our response to major pandemics. I call on everyone here to mobilize.\\nLastly, we must fight urgently, body and soul, against environmental inequality. It is unacceptable that 45 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions are produced by 10 per cent of the planet’s richest inhabitants. As is the case with solar energy, we have an inefficient situation\\n \\nwhen the countries with the greatest potential and needs have the least access to appropriate technologies. It is unsustainable that 100 million more people will be condemned to extreme poverty by 2030 if we fail  to meet our commitments to fighting global warming. Here too we must be united in combat. Some countries represented here are suffering more than others, and we owe them our solidarity. But we will all be held accountable for the disasters that are multiplying before our very eyes, before our peoples and our own children. The proclaimed breakdown of the Paris Climate Change Agreement has been thwarted because we have been able to remain united, despite the decision of the United States to withdraw from it. That strength must continue to support us and help us to ward off all the fatalistic predictions.\\nWe are told that solutions exist but that the funding is lacking. So let us go find it, let us innovate. This is what we did last year in Paris, on 12 December, with many of those gathered here, at the One Planet Summit, with concrete commitments and first results. That is what we did at the beginning of the year in Delhi, with the International Solar Alliance. That is what we will do again tomorrow in New York, at the second One Planet Summit. We are told that it is already too late, that we cannot meet the goals. So let us speed up, let us together adopt the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement in December at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Let us implement the protocol against hydrofluorocarbon gases, which could enable us to reduce the average global temperature by one degree by 2050. Let us set ourselves the goal of concluding an ambitious draft global environmental pact by 2020, and ensuring that the Beijing Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2020 International Union for Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in France will be decisive steps.\\nLet us make a  clear commitment, and let  us all be equally clear, concrete and consistent. This is an emergency. So let us honour the commitments we  have made. Let us no longer sign trade agreements with Powers that do not respect the Paris Agreement. Let us ensure that our business commitments integrate our environmental and social constraints. Let us work harder to involve sovereign wealth funds and financiers in this low-carbon-policy strategy. France will continue to be a global leader in this fight alongside everyone who  wants to join. We  will work  in the G-7  to ensure\\nthat the commitments made at the 2015 Climate Change Conference are increased, and if one of our members does not want to move forward, we will move forward anyway by seeking new coalitions and new formats, because the G-7’s mission is to remain a united group of countries committed to democracy. But today it must also contribute to the creation of new coalitions that will make it possible to improve and restructure the collective global system. So let us build new forms of cooperation to make progress and  take decisions  on those fundamental issues. Only together can we effectively fight the inequalities that have fractured all of our societies and that have fuelled mistrust and the temptation to withdraw — inequalities that we have allowed to grow and to which we have been collectively unable to respond effectively.\\nBut none of us can effectively fight the inequalities I have decried if we act alone. If we do, there are essentially only two solutions. The first is to continually lower the bar and revert to the standards that we know, as we have been doing for decades. We have a trade war, so let us reduce workers’ rights, keep cutting taxes and fuel our inequalities that way in an effort to respond to our trade problems. What does that lead to? It reinforces the inequalities in our societies and the disruption that we are living through. The alternative is to say that it is the rules that are not working, so we should retreat inwards towards isolationism and protectionism. But the only thing that leads to is heightened tensions, which do nothing to address serious inequalities.\\nWhat I am proposing instead is that we put in place a collective mechanism to enable us to work together on what we are doing in each of our countries to reduce inequalities, to evaluate our actions but also to coordinate them better and to disseminate best practices. I therefore propose that international institutions — the United Nations, but the OECD as well, of course — support us in setting up such a mechanism, for which the G-7 must be the driving force.\\nTo defeat inequality, we must change our methods. First, we should revise both our trade and social rules. Rather than pursuing protectionism, we should all work together to thoroughly review the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. We must restore the WTO’s ability to resolve conflicts and establish rules for the unfair trade practices, non-compliance with intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers that make a level playing field impossible. Starting this year, the Group of Twenty summit in Argentina must provide\\n \\nus with a credible road map for rebuilding the WTO. That is also what we will have to do on the social front next year, during the centenary of the International Labour Organization.\\nSecondly, we must also change the modalities of our action, bringing into the scope of our collective action the major  players who are not  in this Hall or  at the General Assembly, the big  non-State  actors who are helping to change the world but who do not participate enough in reducing the inequalities that these transformations bring, and by that I mean the major  digital players, both in terms of taxation and  of responsibility for combating the manipulation of information. We need to  operate  differently  from  our standard collective action where all our major challenges are concerned and include dialogue with these new private stakeholders and Internet giants.\\nThirdly, we must enable Africa to take its rightful place so that it can play a central part in rebuilding the international system. It is not only on that continent that we will collectively win or lose our great battle against inequality — it is with that continent, because today it is in Africa that we find the most fervent defenders of multilateralism and regional integration. Our African partners have fully understood that we can only meet our common challenges together. And this new alliance with Africa will also be a focus of the French presidency of the G-7.\\nI  firmly  believe  that  despite  these  fractures and challenges in the modern  world  order,  we  can put together a new vocabulary for action while also addressing the root causes of inequality today. And it is the responsibility of France and all its European partners, of the European Union, to be in the vanguard in this fight, to build a new, modern humanism that refuses to yield to attempts to withdraw or to simple-mindedness and at the same time, as mediating Powers, to build these new rules for the international order.\\nAt a  time when our collective system is cracking, I have to say that we have never needed it so much. That is why we will support the agencies working on projects for peace and humanity — UNESCO, the conscience of the United Nations; the Human Rights Council; the International Criminal Court; the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, to which we will increase our contribution — because, I want to remind the Assembly, we are simply talking  about enabling\\nhundreds of thousands of children to go to school, nothing less, nothing more.\\nWe will defend expanding both member categories of the Security Council so that its composition reflects today’s balances of power and so that it is strengthened as a forum for consultation rather than obstruction. We will ensure that by the end of the year, two thirds of the members of the General Assembly can support limiting the right of veto in the case of mass atrocities. We will defend international humanitarian law by supporting staff who take extraordinary risks to help civilians on the ground by negotiating humanitarian access to all theatres, one by one.\\nOn the seventieth anniversary of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we will remind the world that human rights are not a cultural thing. They are not simply values or revocable options, but a legal corpus enshrined in international treaties to which the members of the Assembly have freely consented. We will point out that their universality not only does not run counter to a people’s sovereignty, it is rather the only way to ensure the preservation and exercise of those rights.\\nFrance will be there to ensure that the world does not forget that clashing nationalisms only plunge us into the abyss, that when democracies lack the courage to defend their principles, they are weak, and that accumulated resentments, backed only by a fragile international system, can result in a global unleashing of violence twice in the space of one human life. I am speaking from our own experience. In a few weeks’ time, on 11 November, the Paris Peace Forum will present an opportunity for us to see a surge of thoughtfulness and courage as we attempt to rediscover what keeps us together here. For us, united by the tragedies of the twentieth century, it should be a time for renewal and to rediscover the oath we have taken to save future generations from the scourge of war. I want us and our counterparts to take on new responsibilities during the Forum in order to chart the way for concrete actions in the service of peace.\\nI know that many of us may be tired of multilateralism. In a world that is flooded with information and in which in a sense we are in a free-for-all, in which society is a reality show where it is fashionable and newsworthy to say the worst possible things, I know that denouncing the consequences of causes we have championed can be a successful political tactic and\\n \\nthat defending cooperation and multilateralism may no longer be fashionable. Then let us not be fashionable, because we have a duty to those who have made it possible for us to sit in this Hall. Because we must never forget that the genocides that are the reason we are here today were fuelled by the speeches that we are growing accustomed to, by the political spectacles that we applaud. Because we are now seeing international law and every kind of cooperation disintegrate, as if it was nothing, out of fear and complicity and because it looks good.\\nBut I will not do that. I will not do it, because I come from a country that helped to create the declarations that have brought us here, because I come from a country that stands tall, and while it has made many mistakes and done many bad things, it has been able to maintain a kind of universalism at every point in its own history and in international history. This is today. This is now. So we must not get used to it. We must not accept all these kinds of unilateralism. Every day pages are being ripped in a betrayal of our history. And I am not going to get used to it.\\nThis is what I have to say, very clearly. This nascent century is watching us, and our children are waiting. We must resolve our crises. We must work together to combat all our inequalities, but let us do so on a human level and in full accord with our principles, our histories and our universalism. In any case, that is my commitment to everyone here, and I am counting on us all.\\n', 'In 1999, in his message for the New Millennium, the late Kofi Annan spoke words that still ring true almost two decades later:\\n“More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.”\\nMr. Annan’s legacy is one of international cooperation, and of fighting illiteracy, poverty, inequality and climate change as root causes of conflict and human rights violations. Above all, his is a legacy of hope, and a firm belief that progress is  the unifying theme in human history. The Millennium Development Goals proved him right, and it is up to us, the leaders of the united nations of the world, to carry this legacy forward and make the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement a reality.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands remains firmly committed  to international  cooperation.  In   fact, we have enshrined the principle in Article 90 of our\\n \\nConstitution, which states that “the Government shall promote the development of the international legal order”. That provision reflects our moral compass, but it also reflects our history as an open, seafaring and trading nation, and the fact that our Kingdom consists of four countries, in Europe and the Caribbean: Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and Sint Maarten. We have therefore understood for many centuries the necessity and benefits of a transnational outlook.\\nThat is my core message today. We need a transnational outlook to master the challenges we  face. There is no conflict between multilateralism and national interest, but rather the contrary. After all, what country does not benefit from a stable and secure international environment, free and fair world trade, peace instead of armed conflict, prosperity instead of poverty, and equality instead of inequality? And what country can achieve those goals alone?\\nThose are rhetorical questions, of course, but once we acknowledge that, and we should act in consequence, which means we must embrace multilateralism. To the people of the Kingdom of the Netherlands this has only become more evident in the aftermath of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. It remains an open wound for my country, and for all  grieving nations that had nationals on board. We are grateful for the support of the international community, as expressed in Security Council resolution 2166 (2014). We hope that together we will see justice done.\\nIn May, the Joint Investigation Team presented conclusive evidence about the origin of the missile launcher that was used to down the aircraft. This has only bolstered our resolve that, in the interest of the victims and their loved ones, the full truth must be revealed, justice served and responsibility accepted.  In accordance with Security Council resolution 2166 (2014), we call on all States to fully cooperate with ongoing efforts to this end.\\nThere can be no doubt that the rules-based multilateral order that arose after the Second World War has brought great things to many people. That goes especially for the United Nations and the General Assembly. And yet, for many other countries and peoples, the global order has not brought the same benefits. In many parts of the world, peace, stability and prosperity cannot be taken for granted.\\nThe multilateral system is therefore not perfect, and it is under pressure. The playing field is changing\\nas we speak. Some countries, for a range of reasons, have begun to embrace a different approach. Sadly, more and more often, compromise is being rejected in favour of polarization and perceived self-interest. We are witnessing a worrisome trend: some countries are shifting from a constructive to a combative approach in the multilateral environment. What is more, rising repression, human rights violations and shrinking freedom worldwide are a grave concern. Accountability is often lacking. And when the multilateral system becomes paralysed, it is innocent people who suffer.\\nSyria is a case in point. In  his  most recent annual report, Secretary-General Guterres wrote that “working together multilaterally is not optional; it is the only answer” (A/73/1, para. 148). I fully agree. I believe in constructive multilateralism. I believe  in the power of principle, not the principle of power, to guide us towards a better future for more people. Our best — perhaps even our only — way forward is not to give in to defeatism and cynicism but to keep working to improve the system, step by step.\\nIn that regard, let me emphasize once again that the Kingdom of the Netherlands firmly supports the Secretary-General’s reform agenda and that we applaud its initial results. The recent agreement on United Nations reform sends a strong message of broad support for change. But, as always, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Now we have to put words into action, and by “we” I mean the United Nations itself and all the Member States.\\nThe United Nations system must be made fit for purpose to deliver on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, which is the ultimate prevention agenda. Take, for example, the staggering number of 3,000 separate United Nations offices around the world, which is 3,000 arguments that support those who say that multilateralism just creates fragmentation and bureaucracy. The critics are not entirely wrong: United Nations reform should bring down this number by at least a thousand, through co-location, use of shared premises and services, and stronger collaboration. That is a thousand arguments for improving multilateralism, and that is just one example of the broader effort that is required to help the Secretary-General’s reform drive succeed.\\nAnother important initiative is the Secretary- General’s Action for Peacekeeping agenda. Peacekeeping is at the heart of the United Nations, and\\n \\nwe need to keep that instrument up to date. Reforms within the Secretariat and in missions in the field, like the introduction of rotation schemes, will help make peacekeeping missions more effective. For their part, Member States will have to match their words with deeds and money. Supporting change is not a free lunch.\\nThat is why, for example, the Kingdom of the Netherlands was the first Member State to announce funding for a reformed resident coordinator system that will raise the efficiency of the United Nations development system. It is why  today  I  transferred  the intellectual property rights of the Dutch Travel Information Portal to the United Nations. That system, which maps the travel movements of terrorists and organized crime syndicates, will now be accessible to all Member States. It is practical steps like those that improve the United Nations, our United Nations.\\nWhen we look at the United Nations institutions, we must not mince our words. We must tell it like it is. Sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment committed by people working for United Nations missions and organizations is unacceptable in every case and in every place. There are no exceptions. That kind of misconduct undermines the core principles of the United Nations and — as the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out — zero tolerance is the only possible response. We must put the new policies in place without hesitation and act on them. We must make sure that victims feel heard and supported and that whistle-blowers are protected. The United Nations is meant to save and improve lives, not destroy them. Here we must draw a clear line.\\nOf course, improving the multilateral system is not only about institutions and organizing principles. They are only a means to an end. Above all, it is about what we do and why we do it. Over the years, we have gradually learned that the only way to solve problems is to tackle their root causes. We have learned that systematically reducing poverty demands more than money alone, that ending an armed conflict takes more than Blue Helmets alone, that gender equality and education are essential for peace and development, and that sustainability, climate resilience and international stability go hand in hand. The Sustainable Development Goals are built on that concept of integrated thinking and action.\\nThat brings me to a topic that is very important to me personally and to the Kingdom of the Netherlands: water management and adaptation to climate change.\\nThe global water crisis affects us all, in the form of increasing droughts, floods or pollution. As a member of the former High-level Panel on Water, I hope that the agenda for water action we presented earlier this year will inspire others to scale up their action on water. We need to give the value of water greater weight in the economic, social, environmental and other choices we make.\\nFor the Kingdom of the Netherlands, that is self- evident. Amsterdam airport is the only airport in the world that lies below sea level — over four metres below sea level, in fact. So those present can imagine that rising sea levels and the increase in extreme weather are of serious concern to us, as they are for the Caribbean parts of our Kingdom, which are especially vulnerable during the hurricane season.\\nIt goes without saying that we welcome the recent announcement of the new Global Commission on Adaptation. We are proud to be hosting the launch event in my home town of The Hague on 16 October. Of course, we look forward to next year’s climate summit in New York because it should provide a platform to delve deeper into the links among climate resilience, financing and security. Climate and water are, by their nature, issues that can be dealt with only multilaterally, using an integrated approach. The Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 set clear objectives. However, water cuts across all the SDGs. What we need now is international transparency, fair market mechanisms and a level playing field so that all countries can do their part in adapting to climate change.\\nDuring last year’s election of Netherlands United Nations youth representatives, the young candidates were asked what global issue they would address first if elected. Members of the Assembly might expect an answer like world peace, eradicating poverty or ending war. But one of them said:\\n“I would tackle cynicism first. We can change things, but we have to believe  we  can,  roll  up our sleeves and get  started.  Cynicism  will  get us nowhere.”\\nWe all should take inspiration from those words. It is easy to be cynical and criticize the multilateral system. It is harder to make improvements and reforms that will take us forward, step by step. But constructive multilateralism is the only way to make progress. That is what we are working for, and not only as a member of the Security Council until 31 December, but also\\n \\nafterwards and in other international forums. To that end, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will stand as a candidate for the Human Rights Council for the 2020- 2022 term. We will proceed in the spirit of Kofi Annan, who once said that we need to keep hope alive and strive to do better.\\n', 'It is a great privilege for me to stand before the General Assembly today in New York. We are gathered here because of\\n \\nthose who believed, following the tragedy of the Second World War, that an international order based on rules and dialogue, rather than on relationships of power, would lead us to peace and prosperity. They were right. Given the considerable challenges and transformations we must face in the world today, no person or country has the capacity to stand alone. By that I mean globalization, inequality, war and internal conflict, as well as extremism, migration flows and climate change, and even health crises and the digital revolution. It is our shared responsibility — the responsibility of each and every State Member of the United Nations — to ensure that international institutions and organizations are up to the task of supporting us in this endeavour. Unfortunately, there seems to be a tendency at the moment to seek the answers to these problems in nationalist isolation and in increasing mistrust with regard to cooperation between States.\\nWe are seeing a new international order take shape, with new actors and a new middle class. According to the World Bank, between 1990 and 2015 — in a single generation — the number of people affected by extreme poverty fell from 2 billion to 700  million,  a  result that can be described as exceptional. What is of great concern to us today, however, is that these changes have gone hand in hand with the erosion of the international system founded on the rule of law. I believe that we  are witnessing a real crisis in multilateralism, perhaps paradoxically at the very moment when we are trying to forge the main pillars of the global governance of the future. As a country that is interconnected and open  to the world, Switzerland understands the value of a working international legal order based on exchange and multi-stakeholder dialogue, which guarantees stability and is consistent with Swiss values as they are set out in our Constitution.\\nThere are crises currently ongoing in many parts of the world, some of which have been there for  a  very long time, particularly the Middle East, where re-engaging in dialogue is the only option. Switzerland is working for a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians in accordance with international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions, based on a negotiated two-State solution.\\nThe conflict in Syria has entered its eighth year, with no real end in sight. The basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law and human rights are not being respected. In recent months the conflict has intensified further on various fronts. More than\\n13 million men, women and children in Syria are dependent on humanitarian aid. It is essential that we step up our efforts to find a political solution to the conflict. Only a negotiated solution that includes all sectors of Syrian society can guarantee lasting peace and sustainable reconstruction in Syria and the region as a whole.\\nIn Yemen, too, the conflict has been going on for years. The armed conflict has deprived millions of people of water, food and medical care. Switzerland calls on all parties to cease hostilities and come  to the negotiating table to seek solutions to end this humanitarian crisis. In that regard, Switzerland remains ready and willing to play its part — for example, by hosting peace talks in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations.\\nLarge-scale health crises accompany all of those conflicts. The spread of disease, especially in war zones and refugee camps, is a major burden on weakened or ruined health systems. In that regard, it is vital to protect health-care facilities and personnel in order to maintain working health systems and access to medical care.\\nThe United Nations is truly the cornerstone of peaceful coexistence between all States, in accordance with the rules we have established together. It is indispensable and, above all, ideally placed to tackle contemporary challenges, especially the fight against inequality. To fulfil that role, the United Nations must be strong. If it is to make the maximum impact with the means at its disposal, it must adapt to an ever-changing environment and constantly re-examine its working methods. Switzerland is therefore an active supporter of the reform programmes launched by Secretary- General António Guterres. Those reforms, in the areas of peace and security, development and management, aim to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of the United Nations in the face of current global challenges. We are engaged on multiple fronts. Today  I  would like to address the following points. I shall begin by addressing the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nSwitzerland is working  actively  to implement the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable  Development  and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We have been working to put a robust monitoring mechanism in place to provide for voluntary national reviews and report  on progress made towards achieving the Goals. More specifically, we have contributed, with other countries, to providing better statistical data. We are also engaging\\n \\nwith innovative projects in areas such as health care, education, energy and innovation. Nonetheless, we are all aware that there is still work to be done to combat global warming and the negative environmental impacts of economic development.\\nI want to take this opportunity to stress the essential contribution of culture and cultural diversity to building a sustainable and successful society. Without a policy of culture, there is no economic, social or environmental sustainability. Culture must therefore occupy a central place in development policies. In January, more than 30 countries reaffirmed culture’s essential contribution to our lives, as well as the importance of culture overall, in the Davos declaration.\\nSecondly, with regard to the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court, respect for human dignity and fundamental rights is not optional but rather an obvious necessity for stable and sustainable development. Switzerland strongly supports the work of the Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, both based in Geneva, with a view to enabling them  to fulfil their duty to promote, strengthen and protect human rights in the world. International cooperation is also essential in preventing conflict and establishing a framework for lasting peace. I would like to mention in particular the fight against impunity. Switzerland worked for the adoption of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the International Criminal Court, exactly 20 years ago. We will continue to support that unique international cooperative effort at the service of the victims of the most serious crimes.\\nThirdly, I would like to speak about Geneva and the good offices of Switzerland. We intend to continue to build bridges, support negotiations and mediation and use our diplomacy and good offices to help countries and international and regional organizations find solutions to conflicts and create space for new reflections and new topics. In Geneva, Switzerland makes all of the preparations needed so that discreet peace talks, of  the kind undertaken by the parties to  the  conflicts  in Syria and Yemen, can take place. Geneva is also home to several United Nations agencies — the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization — in addition to numerous international organizations. Geneva can therefore serve as a platform for dialogue on new challenges at the interface between politics,  society,  innovation,  science  and  economy. I would mention in particular of the areas of Internet\\ngovernance and digitalization. Those topics develop and increasingly require synergies and dialogue between the traditional arenas of international action. However, Switzerland’s role is not limited to Geneva. For example, we have actively contributed to the process of negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and we are grateful for the trust placed in Switzerland in that regard. The management of migration flows at the global level is an enormous undertaking that necessitates the participation of all the relevant stakeholders. Policies relying on trade protectionism and selfish interests are enjoying a certain popularity at present. They would like us to believe that the world is a zero- sum game and that there are no winners without losers. However, today, as in the past, withdrawal, protectionism, threats and violence will not provide answers to the dysfunctions and disparities of the world in which we live. Worse still, such policies can lead only to a drop in trade and, ultimately, a decline in prosperity. They nurture mistrust and isolation, which obstruct   knowledge-sharing,   competition and innovation. Our world will become all the more impoverished, both spiritually and culturally, and we will set off alone in search of solutions for problems that can only be solved together.\\nThe current malaise serves as a warning that we must do everything we can to prevent a world in which we look out only for ourselves, and to encourage a world of cooperation between States, in which we strive for the common good, for causes such as peace, sustainable development and environmental protection. We can overcome the challenges and causes of growing inequality, demographic change or migration only if we approach them with a spirit of mutual trust. All States are winners if we see others as potential partners instead of competitors. All States are stronger if the international situation is more stable. The world is not a zero-sum game. To the contrary, it is a positive-sum game.\\n', 'A veteran of United Nations diplomacy recently told me that every session of the General Assembly has its own crisis to discuss, its own major topic. So what is the big issue in 2018? Syria? North Korea? The Middle East? Or the dramatic global refugee situation, from the Mediterranean to Venezuela?\\nIf we take a step back, those disparate conflicts reveal a bigger picture and a distinct pattern. It becomes clear that we are  indeed  facing  a  crisis —  a  crisis of multilateralism. And that crisis makes conflicts around the world appear insoluble. When I say that they “appear” insoluble, that reflects the faith that we Germans have in multilateralism. Germany’s post-war success story is also multilateralism’s success story.\\n \\nEurope, which was scarred by war and destruction, was able to integrate in freedom, security and prosperity thanks to our neighbours’ courage in seeking reconciliation. The United States also played  a crucial role in Europe’s reconstruction. The fact that Europe was then able to become the closest partner of the United Nations is a triumph of multilateralism. We believe in the United Nations because international cooperation changed our own fate for the better.\\nEurope has proved to the world that multilateralism and sovereignty are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, in a world faced with immense global problems, we can safeguard sovereignty only by working together.\\nThree words, “we the  peoples”,  express  both our goal and how we will achieve it. That is why the founders of the United Nations chose those as the opening words of the Charter of the United Nations. They wanted to spell out that we need to work together to find solutions. They wanted to leave no doubt as to whom the United Nations and we as representatives of States serve — the people.\\nThe Charter’s promises are addressed to the people, who are assured that their freedom and dignity will be defended at the United Nations in New York. But does a boy in Idlib, who lives in constant fear of the next air strike, feel that? How does a girl in Africa feel when her life expectancy at birth is 30 years lower than it would be if she were born in Germany? If we do not act on their behalf, “we the peoples” will be nothing more than hollow words for them. Kofi Annan once said, “We don’t need any more promises. We need to start keeping the promises we already made.” (SG/SM/9095)\\nWhen Germany  joins  the  Security  Council  as  a non-permanent member in a few weeks’ time, that will be what motivates us. I thank the members of the Assembly for the immense trust they have shown in us through their votes. That trust is an incentive for us to play our part in tackling the world’s crises, and to do so with courage and hope, but without overestimating ourselves. We want to work with all Member States as a reliable partner putting dialogue and cooperation at the heart of its action. In our view, “we the peoples” refers in particular to those who find it hard to be heard at the United Nations. That means we will always seek dialogue with civil society, in the Security Council and beyond.\\nNevertheless, “we the peoples” also means that the Security Council itself must become more representative and inclusive. The world’s population has more than tripled since 1945, while the number of States Members of the United Nations has almost quadrupled. Yet the Security Council has hardly changed at all. That is why we should stop beating around the bush and finally start real negotiations on Security Council reform, as the vast majority of Member States have wanted for a long time.\\nThe crisis of multilateralism is most painfully evident in Syria. The civil war has long since turned into a widespread regional conflict, with further potential for escalation in an already ravaged part of the world. That sort of war cannot be resolved by military means, because the players in the region are too deeply involved and the individual stakes are too high. However, with united diplomatic efforts, we have managed to prevent escalation in Idlib, which is a glimmer of hope. The agreement between Turkey and Russia must now be permanently implemented. But ultimately, and at long last, we need a political process.\\nTo that end, talks must be held under the auspices of the United Nations. In resolution 2254 (2015), the Security Council itself showed the way. We must finally take the path to free and fair elections. At that point, we will also be willing to shoulder responsibility for reconstruction. However, there is one line that we will not cross: we will not become accomplices to a regime that has forfeited its political legitimacy. Instead, we are doing our utmost to alleviate people’s suffering.\\nIt is shameful that financial support is running  out once again. As the second-largest humanitarian donor, Germany is willing to provide the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with a further €116 million — that is, half of the amount currently needed — to help Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. But others also need to step up. After all, the Charter talks about “we the peoples”.\\nDisruptive foreign-policy approaches have now also reached the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many people are keen to make us believe that the notion of a negotiated two-State solution is obsolete. They want us to think that it is now merely a term used in diplomacy and can no longer be achieved. But whatever  way  they twist it, there will be lasting peace only if people can determine the course of their own lives, living in security and dignity on both sides of the 1967 lines.\\n \\nFor that very reason, it remains important to work for a negotiated two-State solution, 25 years after Oslo.\\nThe conflict in Ukraine will also continue to compel our attention. Along with France, Russia and Ukraine, we are working hard to implement the Minsk agreements. The focus is on the measures agreed to a long time ago with a view to stabilizing the ceasefire. All efforts, including our discussions on a possible United Nations mission in eastern Ukraine, are aimed at achieving that end.\\nLet us not forget  that  acute  crisis  management is at best a step towards peace. Lasting peace can be achieved only if we put a stop to the arms race. That is not some sort of nostalgic rhetoric from the days of the Cold War, whose balance of terror seems utterly benign compared to the scenario of a multipolar arms race with far more unpredictable players.\\nIn the case of North Korea, the Security Council’s united stance and sanctions helped to pave the way back to dialogue. That was important. However, North Korea must follow up its words with deeds, and that must lead to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. Germany is prepared to contribute its know-how, including the expertise we gained during the difficult negotiations with Iran.\\nThe nuclear agreement with Iran may not be perfect. But so far, it has prevented Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and averted an escalation that was highly likely three years ago. That is not insignificant. We Europeans, together, therefore stand by the agreement. We are working on keeping economic exchange with Iran possible, and we call on Iran to continue to fully live up to its commitments. The fact that we stand by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action does not mean that we are turning a blind eye to Iran’s destructive role in the region or to its ballistic-missile programme. That said, if there were no agreement, that would not make the search for solutions in Yemen, Syria or elsewhere any easier. On the contrary, disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation must generally become more of a focus of the work of the United Nations once again. We share the view of Secretary-General Guterres on this matter.\\nOur shared rules must keep pace with technological developments. Otherwise, what currently sounds like science fiction may very soon become deadly reality, as exemplified by autonomous weapons systems, or killer robots that kill without any human control. I call\\non Members to support, both here in New York and in Geneva, our initiative to ban fully autonomous weapons before it is too late.\\nIt is not only  in that domain that prevention  is  the right answer. The United Nations of the twenty- first century must tackle the root causes of conflict, including climate change. Action based solely on nationalism, with each country seeking to put itself first, reaches its limits in that respect, not least because our climate knows no borders. The alarm bells have rarely sounded as loudly as they did in the summer of 2018 in almost all parts of the world.\\nGermany and the European Union stand by the Paris Agreement. Moreover, we want to ensure that the Security Council makes the devastating effects that climate change can have on the security and stability of entire countries and regions an even greater priority.\\nWe also need a quantum leap when it comes to post-conflict peacebuilding. That is why Germany will contribute at least €25 million to the Peacebuilding Fund this year. Over the past three years, Germany has tripled its contributions to efforts aimed at promoting stabilization and preventing crises around the world. For example, in Iraq, where Islamic State terrorists have mostly been militarily defeated, instead of leaving the Iraqi authorities to fend for themselves, we are training security forces to support administrative structures and providing civil support for efforts to promote stabilization, reconciliation and inclusive reconstruction.\\nOnly when military measures are embedded in a clear political strategy can peacekeepers truly bring peace. That is also the objective of the peacekeeping reform efforts of Secretary-General Guterres. It would be a mistake to limit our discussion to bartering over decimal points in scales for  assessed  contributions. Of course efficiency is important, including for us in Europe, who are the largest contributors of funding. However, discussing potential cost savings alone  does not do justice to the benefits that peacekeeping missions bring, for example, in countries such as Mali or Lebanon, which have held peaceful elections and enjoyed relative stability, thanks in part to the Blue Helmets and the political efforts of the United Nations.\\nWe Germans will continue to contribute, not only militarily and financially but also, always, politically, through diplomatic efforts and by investing in stability and  reconstruction.  After all,  the  success  of  United\\n \\nNations missions hinges on the political backing of Member States. That is particularly true for Libya right now. To tackle the Herculean task of making progress on functioning State structures, the United Nations needs our political support.\\nPeace is more than guns falling silent. Only just societies, societies where men and women enjoy equal rights and where women participate in all societal decision-making, will remain peaceful in the long term. It is not only a matter of fairness and respect; it is simply a question of humanity and reason. Kofi Annan put it this way in his report entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”:\\n“we will not enjoy development without security, we will not enjoy security without development, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights” (A/59/2005, para. 17).\\nSeventy years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that instrument’s proclamation of dignity and personal freedom remains merely a distant promise for many. In the Security Council, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, we will demand accountability when human rights are trampled on, be it through human trafficking in Africa or attacks on the Rohingya in Myanmar. Nowhere will impunity stand. Even in war, there are limits.\\nWe must hold to account those who wilfully attack humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and schools. Anyone who violates the most basic rules of human civilization must be punished. That also applies to those who use chemical weapons in breach of a taboo that was respected for decades. That is why it is so important that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been mandated to seek and identify those responsible. The perpetrators must be fully aware that there can be no impunity for crimes against humanity — never, and not anywhere. In that regard, the International Criminal Court remains indispensable because it sends a clear message to the victims and the perpetrators of the most serious crimes that justice will prevail.\\nEarlier, I spoke about how we Germans in particular have faith when it comes to multilateralism. That faith is also based on the fact that the United Nations, time and again and despite all disagreements, delivers proof of what we can achieve by working together. I am thinking\\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which remains our guiding set of principles for making this a better world for all people. I am also thinking about the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The fact that more than 190 Member States — countries of origin, transit and destination — reached agreement on such complex and controversial issues is a victory for multilateralism. That success is an achievement of nations that are truly united.\\nThe United Nations is built on our courage to reach compromises. The Organization grows with our desire to shape things. It thrives on our common pledge to act together first. Common ground is created when we put people at the heart of what we do. The desire for peace and security, and the dream of a prosperous and dignified life, are things that all people can relate to, whether they live in Baghdad, Berlin or Bamako. The United Nations belongs to the people. It is to them — the peoples of “We the peoples” — that we owe allegiance.\\n', 'Building a rules based world, promoting dignity and universal values, surmounting the climate challenge and launching humankind on the path to sustainable development — those are the commitments that should bring us together.\\nEach country and nation has its own history and benchmarks, but every human being carries within themselves a spark of freedom, a thirst for emancipation and those universal values that nothing and no one should be able to undermine. That is the meaning of the Charter of the United Nations that unites us.\\nIn a changing world, to use the words of Jacques Chirac, there is no greater risk than standing still. Multilateralism is about movement and continuous dialogue, first to better understand each other and even more to respect each other and build a foundation of trust. Of course, there will be many differences of opinion, people will often refuse to compromise and misunderstandings are possible. History always shows, however, that progress comes from cooperation. To be patriotic is to love one’s own and wish the best not only for them but also for others — that is the very essence of our Organization. It is not a matter of opposing, dividing or regressing; on the contrary, it is a question of connecting, bringing together, strengthening and better committing oneself with the strongest of bonds — universal values and the rule of law.\\nThree global challenges are today testing humankind: climate change, sustainable development, and peace and security. We know that those three challenges are intrinsically linked. Tireless determination, innovation and intelligence are more necessary than ever. We need multilateralism that is bold, brave and enterprising.\\nBack in the nineteenth century, Victor Hugo already understood that “Nature speaks and humankind does not listen”. Our Secretary-General just a few days ago, in words as apt as urgent, perfectly expressed the urgent need to take action on the climate challenge. In my view, there is no room to be paralysed by fear or anger, which are always bad advisers. It is on the contrary a question of translating the appeals to our conscience into positive and irreversible forces, seeking the remedy with a clear mind and taking bold action.\\nThe impact of climate change becomes more evident and destructive by the day. The most recent estimates show that change is accelerating and that the efforts made to date are not enough. In that regard, the vast majority of European States have committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. I also welcome the Chilean initiative to achieve climate neutrality in keeping with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\\nSafeguarding our biodiversity, forests and oceans must also be at the heart of our joint actions. Climate change is having a structural impact on food security, migration and even stability in many countries. But it is our responsibility not to fall into the fearful trap of catastrophism — the transition to carbon neutrality can and must offer positive opportunities for the development and improving our way of life.\\nInnovation, technology, initiative and freedom of enterprise are more crucial than ever and governments, businesses, start-ups, non-governmental organizations and citizens all share responsibility. My message is an optimistic one — we can and will succeed.\\nMy country, Belgium, together with its European partners, is determined to do its part in our global effort, all the more since the reduction of the climate threat must be achieved by strengthening our capacity to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which constitute the keystone of personal dignity and our collective security.\\nIn discharging her duties as SDG Advocate with all of her heart, Queen Mathilde is demonstrating the sincere commitment of my country in the service of those noble objectives. Undeniable progress has been made on several fronts. Extreme poverty has reached its lowest level since records began. Infant mortality and infectious diseases are decreasing and access to drinking water, schooling and education are on the rise. The gains are real, but we know we still have an extremely long way to go. Every 11 seconds, a pregnant woman or newborn child dies somewhere in the world. Hundreds of millions of people do not currently have regular access to drinking water. Too many children do not have access to school and suffer every day from malnutrition.\\nWe must continue to innovate and work towards progress. The private sector can play a major role in reducing poverty. We must promote free trade with reciprocal rules and ambitious social and environmental standards. Investments in basic infrastructure and technological innovation must also be expanded. New technologies, artificial intelligence and the data economy must, however, be better regulated and aligned with personal freedoms, respect for our private lives, and the protection of democratic values against any arbitrary intrusion into our freedom of conscience and expression.\\nThe most recent report of the Secretary-General rightly shows that gender equality is central for overcoming development challenges. I am proud that the Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium, Alexander de Croo, makes a powerful appeal in that regard in his book The Age of Women. I share the belief that feminism is a matter for men as well.\\nWe must change mindsets — a prosperous society depends on the talents of all its people. For that reason, all forms of discrimination must be fought — racism, antisemitism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, hate speech are always devastatingly toxic, insidious, brutal and undignified forms of violence. In the words of Nelson Mandela, “to be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others”.\\nWithout progress, peace is not possible; without peace, progress is not possible. For the sixth time in its history, my country, Belgium, is a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We contribute to the prevention and resolution of crises on a daily basis. We endeavour to make the protection of civilians, especially women and children, the top priority. Every peacekeeping operation, with its particular challenges, is necessary. Mandates must be more specific and better targeted. Effectiveness must be a constant requirement.\\nWe also wish to pay attention to areas of tension and the seeds of conflict — situations not yet in the spotlight but which could quickly take centre stage should they deteriorate. We must detect the warning signs, tackle the root causes, invest in political dialogue, strengthen mediation, promote democratic values, encourage links among different groups, fight hate speech and stop impunity.\\nThe world is changing. We want a better world that is more predictable. The multiplication of tensions and crises, if not defused swiftly enough, can spiral out of control, seriously threatening peace and security. In the Gulf region, an atmosphere of escalation is growing stronger, threatening not only regional but also global stability. Oil facilities in the Strait of Hormuz are strategically important for the global economy. We call on all actors concerned to refrain from any unilateral measures likely to inflame tensions. We must avoid any incident liable to trigger ever worse consequences. We call for restraint and dialogue to open the way towards a more stable and secure future in the Gulf region.\\nA divergence of views on the nuclear deal with Iran generated the current tensions. We continue to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. We call for discussions to resume on all subjects of concern — the nuclear question, Iran’s role in the region and its ballistic missile programme. We therefore express out full support to the mediation efforts under way at the initiative of France.\\nThe situation in Syria also remains cause for concern. We are worried by the escalation of violence in and around Idlib. In the Security Council we have taken, together with Germany and Kuwait, a position against the escalating violence, proposing a humanitarian draft resolution last week aiming to achieve a ceasefire and protect the millions of civilians living that area. We regret that, despite broad support, the draft resolution was subject to a double veto. The bombing of civilian populations, schools and hospitals in no way advances the fight against terrorism; rather, it likely helps fuel terrorism.\\nWe will not abandon the Syrian people. There is no military solution to that conflict. Only a political process under the auspices United Nations will make it possible to bring it to an end. The establishment of the Constitutional Committee is a step in the right direction.\\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for decades, yet today peace seems a more remote possibility than ever. The situation on the ground is deteriorating, violence and mistrust are reinforcing each other and settlements are actively continuing. Nonetheless, we must promote the emergence of a just and lasting peace in the interests of both the Palestinians and Israelis and of the region as a whole.\\nThe parameters for a just and lasting peace are well recognized. International law is the cornerstone of the multilateral order and any initiative seeking to circumvent it only fuels further injustice and conflict. The aim must remain to create an independent sovereign, democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours. Israel must enjoy peace and security within secure and internationally recognized borders.\\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Belgium’s leading international cooperation partner, we continue to work side by side with the population. The first steps towards the expansion of political space, such as the release of political prisoners, are heartening, although immense challenges remain to better meet the legitimate expectations and aspirations of the population. We will support all positive forces seeking to contribute to forging a better future for that great country at the heart of Central Africa.\\nTurning to the Sahel, the security situation is deteriorating despite the actions of the States of the region and the efforts of the international community. Insecurity is spreading and inter-ethnic conflict, fanned by the proliferation of militias, is being capitalized upon by terrorist groups, which are steadily extending their murderous reach beyond the Group of Five for the Sahel countries to threaten neighbouring countries as well. Flows of displaced persons are intensifying, cultures are in danger and the humanitarian situation is overwhelming the region’s populations. We need to mobilize side by side with the States of the Sahel and we must uphold our commitments to them.\\nWe are not rid of terrorism. The fall of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria does not signal the end of its deadly criminal ideology. Da’esh continues its indoctrination and threatens innocent and vulnerable targets as well as law enforcement, seeking to spark radicalization with an absolute cynicism and relentlessly stirring up hatred and anxiety.\\nMy country, like many others, has been directly afflicted by the cowardice of terrorism. We must be tireless and fearless in our fight against violent extremism. Prevention and suppression must be more effective. International cooperation will be crucial here, too, to eradicate the scourge that inflicts such sorrow on our world.\\nThe shared dream we must all work to realize is that of a world that is more stable, more predictable and more just. To our children and their children in turn, we wish to leave a planet that is healthier, better living standards, rights and freedoms. No border can interrupt that universal dream.\\nEradicating the climate threat, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and working tirelessly for peace and security will require broad and unwavering determination. Preventing conflicts at an early stage and defusing them, dealing peacefully with disputes, weaving the fabric of dialogue and nurturing the bonds of trust, that is what we believe is necessary to live up to the Charter of the United Nations, which obliges us to enact those binding universal values and, above all, to live up to the humanity that resides in the heart and soul of everyone one of us.\\n', 'We are gathered here at the General Assembly at a time when the Secretary-General has chosen the very important theme of climate — we met on the subject yesterday — when impatience is being expressed everywhere and when everything in the world around us — or at least many things — could lead us to be pessimistic. We are not meeting our own expectations — the objectives that we have set for ourselves — in the fight against global warming and in the fight for biodiversity. The many tensions are at an unprecedented level in some parts of the world. Take, for example, what happened recently in the Gulf, or the challenges many of our friends in this Hall are confronting — our friends from the Sahel in particular, whose friendly faces I see here, and from many other regions.\\nThese conflicts are increasingly harsh, cruel to civilians, humanitarian workers and human rights defenders. As David Miliband says, we have entered an age of impunity. Commercial tensions are increasing, and concerns are growing about technological changes and their consequences. I do not want to paint a pessimistic picture here — and I know how tired delegations are of listening to the many speeches that have been given since this morning; indeed, I wish to spare us the litany of all the reasons for despair. Nevertheless, we have everything we need to meet these challenges, everything, and in a new way.\\nFirst, we have knowledge. Never before in the history of the world has science been brought together in such a way as to be able to describe the challenges we face and provide the means to address them, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, to the point where we are building upon technological revolutions. It has been described thus: every year we know a little bit more.\\nWe have the funding, which is not lacking across the globe. We have an unrivalled capacity for innovation, which, on many of the subjects I have cited, is also a means of responding to these challenges: in the fight against poverty and in efforts to foster stability and respond to the major changes I have just mentioned. We have an unprecedented awareness of these contemporary evils. We have our youth, who are weighing in on the climate and freedoms. And we have, I must say, public opinion, which is more informed than ever before. And we have a framework, which is operative in this Hall today: the framework of free States that recognize each other and are supposed to work for the common good and prepare for the future of humankind, responding to these contemporary crises. We also have multilateral regional frameworks on many subjects and thematic frameworks on such topics as trade and economic cooperation.\\nSo what are we missing? What is it that makes us give speeches that make our peoples feel we cannot respond to their fears?\\nOn reflection, as I prepared to speak today, I was reminded of a text that has often been with me, namely, the Harvard commencement address given by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn in 1978 on the decline of courage. We lack courage, spectacularly and often. Basically, today I just wanted to tell the General Assembly that the appeal I would like to make would be on the revival of courage — on two subjects to begin with: the courage to know how to build peace and the courage to take responsibility.\\nThe courage to know how to build peace is important because, first of all, it takes courage to do so and because building peace always involves taking a risk, which consists in not simply defending one’s primary interests or one’s positions that have sometimes led to escalation or tensions. In all regions of the world, building peace is about taking the risk — the risk of dialogue, compromise, rebuilding trust — and in so many regions, that is what we need. That is what the Middle East needs today. That is what the Gulf region needs. Courage is not tensions, provocation, ripostes. It is a demanding consultation that is carried out in a transparent manner.\\nFrom the very first time I addressed the General Assembly (see A/72/PV.4) I expressed my strong belief with respect to Iran that the strategy of applying pressure on the Iranian nuclear issue could lead only to an increase in tensions in the region if, basically and above all, it did not have clear prospects for achieving a diplomatic solution. In 2018, after the United States withdrew from the 2015 Vienna Agreement, I proposed a comprehensive framework to preserve the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) and complement it with a broader approach to address the issues raised by Iran’s post-2025 nuclear programme, the country’s role in regional crises and its ballistic programme. Where are we today?\\nIn response to the American strategy and the European, Russian and Chinese desire to preserve the 2015 Vienna Agreement, Iran has responded with a strategy of maximum pressure on its regional environment. In that context, the increase in tensions was constant in recent months, and the 14 September attacks on Saudi Arabia have changed the situation. From that point on, the risk of a flare-up based on a calculation error or a disproportionate response has become greater today. Peace is at the mercy of an incident that is getting out of hand, and the consequences for the whole region and beyond would be too serious for us to accept living on the brink of disaster.\\nSo what can we do? More than ever, I believe very deeply, the time has come to resume negotiations among the United States of America, Iran, the signatories to the JCPOA and the Powers in the region that are primarily concerned with the region’s security and stability.\\nWhat should be the terms and objectives of those negotiations? First, there must be complete certainty that Iran will never acquire nuclear weapons. Secondly, there must be an end to the crisis in Yemen. Thirdly, a regional security plan integrating the other crises in the region and the security of maritime transit flows must be drawn up. Finally, economic sanctions must be lifted.\\nI am in no way naive, nor do I believe in miracles. I believe in the courage to build peace, and I know that the United States of America, Iran and all the signatories to this agreement have that courage. It is with the same conviction that we will continue our work on Syria, Libya and the Sahel, which has been discussed at length in recent weeks and, in particular, at the Group of Seven Summit in Biarritz.\\nWith regard to Syria, I would like to welcome the encouraging announcements made yesterday by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and a decisive step forward with respect to the constitution, at last, by the long-awaited Constitutional Committee. We all look at the humanitarian situation in Idlib with vigilance and high standards. We are all committed to Syria’s stability, throughout all its regions, and to the protection of all its people. We will continue to work towards a sustainable and inclusive political solution in Syria, which entails the work of the constitutional committee and securing Syrian territory so as to enable the voluntary and safe return of all refugees. It further requires a free electoral process that will include all Syrian citizens.\\nWith respect to Libya, the Group of Seven (G-7) summit recalled our objectives and convictions. I believe very strongly that we currently need a robust inter-Libyan reconciliation conference and a firm commitment from the African Union, alongside the United Nations, to achieve that. Many initiatives have been undertaken. I welcome the commitment of Germany and all stakeholders who want to build peace. Lasting peace, however, can be built only on the basis of reconciliation among the Libyans themselves.\\nIn the Sahel, France’s commitment is well known, ongoing and reaffirmed. There too, the future lies in building lasting cooperation in the region among the five States members of the Group of Five for the Sahel, securing the commitment of our armies, involving the United Nations, changing the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and fully integrating our objectives of fighting terrorism and entrenching sustainable security in the Sahel into the missions that we have deployed. It is essential to transfer MINUSMA’s mandate to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, continue to involve all the armies in the region, re-engage all the region’s security forces in the fight against terrorism and commit our energy to development and stabilization. Those are all situations in which engaging in dialogue and crafting political solutions are the key to success.\\nThat courage to build peace is something we have seen in recent months at work in an unforeseen and unexpected way in the Sudan thanks to the strength of the Sudanese people, the capacity for dialogue between the army and the people, the work of the African Union and the role of Ethiopia, whose foresight and commitment to the whole region I want to salute here.\\nIt is that same courage to build peace that is now required in Ukraine. President Zelenskyi has taken the first steps, President Putin has been able to respond to him and progress has been made in recent weeks. We see our horizon and know that the next steps are implementing the Minsk agreements and, ultimately, building a lasting peace on the ground. In the coming weeks, we will convene a summit in the Normandy format at the level of Heads of State and Government.\\nOn each of those subjects, the question that is always asked is how to recreate an effective framework for cooperation among States. I believe that that it is possible. I do not believe that the problems that we face today can be solved by diluting responsibilities or by a globalism that, in a way, neglects the people. In that regard, I agree with what President Trump said this morning. I also do not believe that the crises that we are experiencing would be best resolved by national withdrawal. I believe very deeply in patriotism so long as it incarnates both love of country and the aspiration to the universal. I believe very deeply in sovereignty so long as it represents both autonomy for oneself and the need for cooperation.\\nWhat we need today is to reinvent what I defined when I last addressed the Assembly in speaking of robust multilateralism (see A/73/PV.6). That is not to say that our multilateralism is worn out, that we no longer listen to ourselves or that we are no longer effective. Rather, it is in acknowledgement that there is no solution to be found in national withdrawal or without cooperation. That cooperation must, however, produce concrete results and engage new actors. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of such robust, contemporary multilateralism.\\nI believe that we achieved that on the issue of climate when, after the American decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we launched the One Planet Summit, together with the United Nations and the World Bank, which allowed us to maintain cohesion and engage new actors, investors and companies, as we saw again yesterday at the summit organized by the United Nations. We must engage new actors, create momentum and resist disintegration.\\nIn that regard, Russia’s ratification of the Paris Agreement, announced yesterday, is a sign of the success of that approach, in addition to what we have been able to undertake on many coalition issues. That is the same highly pragmatic multilateralism that we adopted to fight terrorism on the Internet through the Aqaba process and in the Christchurch Call to Action Summit, held on 15 May in Paris. I pay tribute here to the commitment of the King of Jordan and the Prime Minister of New Zealand.\\nYesterday, we made a breakthrough when 50 countries joined that initiative and platforms were committed to set operational protocols and remove terrorist content. We will go even further, but we now have a concrete, real answer. We must continue to move forward, innovate and respond to contemporary challenges in a spirit of partnership, information and democracy. We must now innovate in the same spirit to secure our safety and security.\\nThe major challenge for us today is that we are no longer capable of ensuring stability in an increasingly conflict-ridden world, having left behind the bipolar world in which we lived for decades. We no longer really have the last-resort guarantors of our deep-seated balances. As such, disorders have set in and things are often slow to be resolved effectively. I believe very strongly that the courage to build peace requires the reaffirmation of our values — those of human rights and the dignity of human beings, which must not be subject any form of contemporary relativism. It calls for practical re-engagement in all areas of operation that I mentioned earlier, with a view to building peace and stability and proposing tangible solutions to the people.\\nI would refer, too, to the courage to take responsibility for our manifold challenges. When we talk about contemporary common goods, the climate, education and inequalities, we can say that we understand and see things for what they are. Today, we have an array of experts who are telling us about and describing in unprecedented detail the situation of our world. If we have weakened, it is because we have too often decided to question the truth, contest the facts, favour the short term and sometimes protect certain interests, and the loss of meaning has taken hold. But the reality is there.\\nInequalities have again increased in our world among countries and within our countries. Our contemporary capitalism has become dysfunctional, leading to an unparalleled level of inequality. We are no longer capable of solving abject poverty and new forms of inequality, such as inequalities of opportunity and gender, as well as in access to education in the poorest regions, access to health care and necessary treatments, and climate, when it comes to the most vulnerable countries or the poorest regions that are hit even harder by global warming or the increasing scarcity of biodiversity.\\nOn all those subjects, I presented the proposed the G-7 agenda last year and the desire to place the fight against inequality at its very core. I would like to briefly comment on that. I believe that we can collectively contribute to that subject in order for a response to begin to materialize, with a view to supporting the collective commitment already made to the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a way out of the short term; it is a decision to change our system. We have collectively committed, first and foremost, to a very proactive agenda for Africa and for the Sahel, its security, stability and development and, more broadly, to draft an agenda for Africa based on genuine security, development and reciprocity. In that context, we will host an Africa-France summit in France next June, based on economic partnerships and the involvement of civil societies in a spirit of deep reciprocity.\\nIt is an agenda for equality between women and men. In Biarritz, we launched the €251-million Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa initiative to support women entrepreneurs in Africa, and we will work with Angelique Kidjo to ensure that projects are quickly launched. That initiative was proposed by African women and operated by the African Development Bank, and for which the major economic Powers have decided support through investment.\\nWe have supported Dr. Mukwege’s fund for the protection of victims of sexual violence and launched the Gender Equality Advisory Council, which we have expanded in conjunction with this session of the General Assembly and which, for the States that join it, consists of implementing at least one measure at the national level on women’s rights, based on best practices around the world.\\nThe fight for gender equality is crucial, because we have not won it within our societies, as evidenced by the persistence of feminicide in France and many other countries. We must give it legal status and build effective action to eradicate it. We must do even more than we have done before, because we are seeing in numerous States a decline in equality between women and men and a questioning of women’s rights to control their bodies and the achievements of past decades. We must act because wherever inequality between women and men takes root, it leads to a decline in civilization, a rise in obscurantism, a growth in terrorism and a downturn in education. It also leads to diminished growth, because it means depriving each of those countries of half of its potential wealth.\\nThat is also why we strongly support the United Nations on that agenda. On the three principles of action — namely, emancipate, protect and ensure real equality — we will act in view of the Generation Equality Forum, to be held in Paris in July 2020, 25 years after the Beijing Declaration, which marked the history of our Organization. There is no turning back now. We must move forward into a new era.\\nWe must also fight that battle and have the courage to assume responsibility for our health. Here too, we have seen even today too many setbacks and difficulty of access to treatment in some regions, despite our efforts. The sixth replenishment conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria will be held on 10 October in Lyon, France. From this rostrum in 2002, Kofi Annan called for the creation of a global fund to fight inequalities in the face of the possibility of curing deadly diseases. The Fund was then established, with the support of the Group of Eight at the time, and 32 million lives have been saved as a result.\\nI insist that the eradication of major pandemics is within the reach of our action. We can save 16 million lives in the coming years. We must simply recognize that no one can understand any longer how, for reasons of finance and inequality, it is impossible today to access treatments to prevent or cure such diseases or to slow their resurgence. That is why we need $14 billion in Lyon. We have three weeks, and we will put all our energy into making sure that a new global fund meets our ambition.\\nLastly, the issue of climate is also a fight against inequalities and one of the subjects on which the courage of responsibility must be exemplified. Essentially, there is an ongoing paradox in climate matters, to which we are collectively being inured. We have basically given our impatient young people a boilerplate response. We give them the opportunity to express themselves and we tell them that we can hear them and that they are doing great; and then, all too often, we go on doing just as we did before. That will not hold up.\\nI welcome the commitment of the Secretary- General and say that, in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss, we must undertake even stronger action and fundamentally change our collective Organization, the system itself, and seek not to offset, but rather to correct and change it ourselves with all our investors, companies and societies.\\nFirst, we must broaden our ambitions. That is crucial if we are to have a chance at limiting the rise in temperatures to below 2°C by the end of the century. To that end, we must act in 2020. In Europe, we must make the necessary decisions in 2020 in that regard, particularly on carbon taxation, with a real, higher minimum price and border taxation. If we have not convinced some partners to follow that agenda, those courageous decisions are needed, and the time is now.\\nWe need to engage all countries more broadly in a carbon neutrality strategy by 2050. Several have joined that coalition. President Piñera Echenique has just presented it to the Assembly. We must continue to convince stakeholders and participate in that essential strategy. India has just expressed its willingness to join that agenda and coalition. I am aware of China’s proactive approach to climate change, which has been so important in recent years.\\nI know that together, if we commit to carbon neutrality, we can make a significant difference in achieving our objectives. As such, the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Chile, and the twenty-sixth session, to be held in Europe, will be defining events.\\nSecondly, we must bring our agendas and actions back into line. I said this yesterday, but we cannot claim to be doing everything perfectly well and call for calm while we continue to be dependent on coal, as is the case in too many countries. Everyone, within their own limitations and with the help of the international community, the right funding and respect for each component of our societies, needs to commit to a strategy to wean ourselves of coal.\\nThe major countries of the world must also stop financing new polluting facilities in developing countries. We continue to this day to export financing and projects in various countries financed by developed countries, which consist of launching new polluting structures and telling developing countries, the poorest countries, in not so many words that climate change is not for them. They can go on polluting; everything’s fine where you are. That is inconsistent and irresponsible. Let us be honest with ourselves. We must commit all our development banks, as we began to do on Sunday, towards a reorientation of financing towards renewable energies everywhere, because in Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific, the future of energy production is also about getting out of coal and no longer being coal-dependent.\\nIn the same way, we must build a climate fund commensurate with these ambitions. In a few weeks, the first Green Climate Fund pledging conference will take place in Paris and I call on our major partners on this issue to provide crucial financing. There are many of us that have already doubled our commitments and I urge others to do the same, as such contributions will be most decisive.\\nOn the matter of coherence, as I said yesterday, we can no longer have open, free-trade commercial strategies that do not include the climate question in their own agendas. The two must be combined. I believe in openness and free trade, but only to the extent that they are well thought out and able to integrate the objectives of zero carbon and zero deforestation. This means that, at each stage, we must build compatible solutions and find measures for compensation. However, we cannot force certain countries to make efforts and then continue to trade with those that do not, and we cannot continue to make statements from this rostrum and continue importing products that contradict them.\\nNothing is going to change overnight. France, on its part, is too often an importer of products that lead to deforestation. This will involve deep-rooted changes and partnership strategies with countries of origin, with our businesses and our financial backers. I am not saying that everything is going well in France and that we are doing everything right; that is far from the truth. But if we are not collectively responsible and transparent and if we do not accept the fact that we must practice what we preach when it comes to our commercial policies and climate agendas, we will never achieve it. It will take some years, but we must start now.\\nThere are two climate-related topics that I wish to underscore here before concluding. If we want to succeed in the war on climate change, we must look to save our forests and our oceans. These two battles are essential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and preserve our biodiversity balance. We are currently losing the battle on these two global issues. Yesterday, I believe that the commitment demonstrated by all marked an important step forward in defending the Amazon rainforest and the African forest — that is, the primary forest reserves of our planet.\\nWe have countries that have committed to this cause — France is one of them — but here I wish to highlight in particular the efforts of Germany and Norway. We were joined by major countries, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and the majority of the countries affected by Amazonia, to speak diplomatically. I encourage all those who wish to join the fight to join it, but we need to move forward. By the time the United Nations Climate Change Conference takes place in Santiago, we will have met extremely effective and pragmatic criteria so as to invest more closely on the ground and find useful solutions to promote reforestation, biodiversity and agroecology protection and all economic development projects concerning Amazonia and the African forest in the Congo basin. This will promote economic development and forest preservation, and thus our fight for biodiversity and against global warming.\\nThe fight for biodiversity, too, will be the focus of major meetings in 2020, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in France and the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Beijing. We need clear actions to be taken by 2020. When it comes to our oceans, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report Global Warming of 1.5°C is utterly devastating. We have been confronted with the naked, stubborn truth and we are losing the battle. At the recent G-7 Summit in Biarritz, we began building coalitions with major transporters, which committed to reducing speeds. This is just the beginning — we are far from having won — and I hope that we will commit, as we are doing for the forests, to the fight for the oceans with the funding and concrete actions needed to win this battle.\\nRight now, it is all about our initial changes and our initial actions. I cannot stress enough that what we are collectively trying to do is vital. It is about working together to try to change our collective political, economic, social organizations to reduce inequalities and, better still, to prevent them. I do not believe that the right response to growing contemporary inequalities in the areas of climate, opportunities and education lies in the fiscal agenda of each individual country. I believe that the answer lies in education, access to health care and policies to prevent inequality in each individual country, but above all in stronger international cooperation and a robust agenda to combat such inequalities.\\nBut on a fundamental level, this requires an agenda of reconciliation. What we are seeing in front of us is, on the one hand, a constant rhetoric of condemnation. I hear it, and it pushes us to act, but words of condemnation are no longer enough. We know that we cannot go on simply condemning. Our predecessors condemned 20 years ago, which allowed groups of experts to be established. But alongside this rhetoric of condemnation, for some, there is comfort in inaction, a habit of cynicism. In the middle of it all, there is a rather haphazard, somewhat clumsy group of people trying to take action.\\nLet us take this challenge in our stride; let us build this agenda of reconciliation with our public opinion, with our youth, with our companies, with our investors and with Governments of good faith. We have the facts; let us continue to establish them and, from now on, change our habits. We must change our consumer habits, our production habits, our investment habits, our governance and civic habits in order to collectively engage in this agenda for change. Remaining in this tandem of condemnation and inaction will lead to nothing.\\nI firmly believe that the courage to assume responsibility means facing the facts, to accept that there are things we can do right now and others that will take time, because in all of our countries there are producers depending on certain products that are harmful; there are people who live in poorly constructed housing and continue to pollute even as they move on. We cannot point the finger at them. Rather, we must help them to change and we must offer solutions through technological innovation, investment and a real agenda to fight social and climate-related inequalities. That agenda of reconciliation is what we need and that is what I want to do in France, what we need to implement in Europe and what we must build right here.\\nThat is what I wanted to say today. I believe in this courage to take responsibility and, more broadly, I believe that this courage will return. In any case, I believe we have no other choice. We must work together. Our grammars have changed; they are no doubt more complex than they were in the past and they certainly engage us more. We know that when it comes to security, inequality, health and climate change, we will all be accountable. But I no longer believe in the easy way out of pessimism. I no longer believe in division. I believe in our ability to propose ideas, to reflect and to act together to build this agenda for reconciliation that will enable everyone, everywhere, to see the light in our future.\\n', 'I would like to begin on a personal note by thanking the previous speaker, Charles Michel, who will be stepping down from the Belgian Government in a few months to take over the reins of the presidency of the European Council. I take this opportunity to wish him the best of luck as his neighbour in that endeavour that will occupy him for some years to come.\\nAt the outset, I think we are all aware that the week under way here is remarkable in several respects — not only in the number of Member States participating, which continues to grow, but also the number of topics addressed during this week, whether in plenary, major meetings or in side events in parallel to the series of summits or high-level events.\\nThis week is further notable for the unprecedented momentum to tackle specific challenges. I am referring, first and foremost, to the climate emergency, as reflected by the great many demonstrations in cities and towns in countries around the world. The activism of young people, together with the proliferation of initiatives by civil society, the private sector and intentional entities, is truly remarkable. We have all seen that over the past few days.\\nHowever, it is through the actions of the men and women in Government that the momentum must find its expression in order to prevent an environmental, economic and ultimately geopolitical catastrophe. International security, growth, migration and human rights — not one of those areas is today unaffected by climate change, which becomes ever more alarming each year. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change details the scale of the challenge and the urgent need for action. Only by cutting present global greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 followed by climate neutrality by 2050 will allow us to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\nI was able to take the opportunity, for which I am grateful, on Monday during the Climate Summit to give an account of my country’s contributions to collective efforts: first, we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 55 per cent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels; secondly, we will increase the share of renewable energy in the mix we consume by 23 to 25 per cent by 2030; we will increase energy efficiency by 40 to 44 per cent by 2030; and thirdly, we will soon adopt a framework climate law aiming to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest.\\nThose figures notwithstanding, most young people are frustrated because they believe such numbers are empty promises and will remain nothing more than numbers we proclaim. It is up to us to reassure our children that their future is secure. The hope and optimism of emerging generations also feed on their trust in their parents’ actions. However, in the fight against climate change over the decades to come, young people are our allies, because they are never, on principle, opposed to change. Never. Youth brings change. It embodies change. For young people, change is a virtue; it is fundamentally positive. It is the way life is.\\nWe understand that life is also about movement. When one is young and more so when one is no longer young, it is easy to note the importance of mobility. In Luxembourg, we decided to show that the fight against climate change can bring positive change and an improvement in the quality of life for all. We undertook an unprecedented landmark measure — free public transport at the national level for all buses, trams and trains, starting next year. Of course, we need an attractive, reliable and comfortable public transportation system. These are all challenges that we must overcome, and we are working on them.\\nWith regard to international solidarity, for 2021-2025, Luxembourg will allocate €200 million for financial and technical assistance to combat climate change in developing countries, with priority given to the least developed countries and small island developing States. On an annual basis, that is twice the sum allocated in 2014-2020. A significant portion of those funds will go to the Green Climate Fund.\\nLuxembourg will continue its efforts to create a favourable environment for green finance. In 2016, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange launched the Luxembourg Green Exchange, the first global listing platform dedicated exclusively to green bonds. In partnership with the European Investment Bank, also based in Luxembourg — which I sincerely thank for its collaboration — we created the Climate Finance Platform to increase our ability to leverage private investments in climate projects while mitigating their financial risk. We hope that, in the long-term, that this project will extend to the financing of the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\\nAt the Summit held here yesterday and the day before, we discussed how critical financing is to meet those important Goals. That said, the contribution of States remains essential, especially in the area of financing for development. Another summit is being held on this subject in a room a few steps from here, where my country will present innovative initiatives, particularly in the field of investment vehicles with a social and environmental impact. The mobilization of private resources is a reality in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\\nHowever, the most innovative mechanisms cannot compensate for the relative decline in public funding. For its part, Luxembourg will continue to devote 1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance, with a focus on the least developed countries. The funds allocated to international climate financing and to hosting refugees are additional to that, in accordance with the principle of additionality.\\nFor years, we have remained convinced — and I know that the politics of cooperation just before elections, for some, is not very popular — that no matter what Administration is in power in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, investing in cooperation is the best preventive measure and the best investment that can be made. And we will continue to do so.\\nThe five summit meetings being held this week on the margins of the general debate illustrate that the major challenges facing humankind can be addressed only within a universal and comprehensive framework. Nevertheless, there is a sense that multilateralism has, in other periods, been more successful than it is today. We see that, for example, in the fields of human rights, migration, security and trade. With regard to trade, for instance, the use of unilateral measures and countermeasures — often based on real concerns, but also often based on false pretexts — helps no one and drags us into a cycle that is dangerous to the entire international community. It is our people who, ultimately, end up losing out.\\nIt is our duty, for the sake of our future, to relaunch multilateral formats. For our part, we have always been in favour of active, dynamic and rule-of-law multilateralism. This is natural for a small country with an open economy, but it is also an informed choice beyond the considerations of sovereignty alone. To the extent that we are able, we try to participate actively in the most committed forums in the pursuit of greater international cooperation. In that connection, to name but two examples, I note our participation in the High Ambition Coalition to fight climate change and our contribution to the Alliance for Multilateralism.\\nThe European Union is one such push for multilateralism, which has enabled our continent to live in peace since 1957. Despite the limited conflict we have seen on the European continent, the members of the European Union have lived in peace since then. In that connection, the rise of populists in Europe is not helping. Conflicts, frozen or not, disputes between States and internal tensions among ethnic or religious groups persist in Europe. We cannot claim that Ukraine is now living in peace. The Caucuses and the Balkans are also rather tense. In other words, Europe is not in a position to lecture others on their actions. Nevertheless, it is important to be able to share and seek solutions together.\\nTurning to the Middle East, the peace process is not improving, but rather is deteriorating year upon year. The prospects for a just and balanced peace are diminishing, along with the concept of a two-State solution. Recent developments in the context of the election campaign in Israel bear that out. At the same time, recent initiatives of an essentially bilateral nature, if they ever come to fruition, cannot replace the multilateral actors that confer international legitimacy on any negotiated solution.\\nThe Middle East remains a source of serious concern. The wars in Syria and Yemen continue. We cannot never forget the suffering of civilians, the denial of humanitarian assistance and the flagrant, repeated and systematic violations of human rights in the region, which are our primary concern. But there are also other recent events, such as the attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Let us therefore learn from our mistakes.\\nAll actors in the region must help calm the situation and avoid escalation. That, of course, also applies to Iran, as well as to all other actors in the region. Tehran must also comply anew with all the provisions of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. My country, like the whole of the European Union, wants to believe that it is possible — even if it means broadening the scope — to make the 2015 agreement work. But if that is to happen, the United States and Iran must resume their dialogue.\\nThe very volatile situation in the Middle East reminds us that contemporary crises are complex and have enormous explosive potential. Today, the mobile and instantaneous nature of communications have brought us closer to the misfortunes of all in a much more direct way. We must never forget that, beyond trade relations, direct investments and alliances, it is the destinies of individuals — men, women and children — that connect us all.\\nThat is particularly true with regard to the situation in Libya, which is not improving. We see the ongoing difficulties that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ghassan Salame, continues to experience in bringing the parties to the table. It is crucial to reflect on how to resolve that situation. We know, too, that today it is impossible to tackle the situation in Libya without addressing the plight of the thousands of migrants from Africa, who must traverse the war-torn country in the hope of reaching Europe.\\nI believe it is important to note that the ties between the African continent and mine are not limited to migration issues. Too often, there is a tendency to limit them to that issue. They never have been and never will be. Our ties are ancestral, forged by geographical and cultural proximity and by a common history, which has been painful at times and marked by the slave trade and colonialism, among other things. Today, my country’s ties with the countries and peoples of the African continent are ties of friendship, solidarity and mutual respect. Luxembourg maintains particularly close links with the francophone West African countries.\\nI would now like to say a few words about human rights worldwide. The situation on the ground is not good, and I am not referring only to conflict situations. It is also deteriorating with respect to gains that we thought had been consolidated and that are now systematically being called into question.\\nIn conflict situations, the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war is a scourge that continues to strike throughout the world. We have seen this in equatorial Africa, in the Great Lakes region, in Iraq with Da’esh and in the Balkans. This year, we organized a conference under the auspices of the Foundation of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess to address this issue.\\nThe situation of children in armed conflict also remains a source of great concern. The reports prepared by the United Nations are appalling. Although the Organization does not remain passive in such situations, Member States do not always understand the full consequences of their actions. Initiatives to reduce funding for human rights protection or children in armed conflict when deciding on funding for United Nations peacekeeping operations are hard hearted and difficult to justify.\\nThose responsible for human rights violations in such situations must know that they too will one day be held accountable. Impunity cannot become the norm. The jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is not universal, but it is an integral part of the international system, and the Court’s representatives must be able to travel and operate in that capacity without obstacles, including here in New York at United Nations Headquarters. When the ICC is unable to act, impartial and independent investigative mechanisms, such as those established by the General Assembly in the case of Syria and by the Human Rights Council in the case of Myanmar, provide an alternative.\\nThe oppression of religious minorities and their lack of protection by the State have not been eliminated in the twenty-first century. In Asia, Africa, the Near and Middle East, countless women and men are persecuted. No distinction should be made between the rights of Christians, Jews or Muslims or members of any other faith. I know that Europe is not in a position to lecture others on this point. Barely seventy-five years after the liberation of the extermination camps in Europe, the European continent continues to have a duty to preserve and honour that memory, especially at a time when speeches invoke that same hatred, xenophobia, intolerance and anti-Semitism, which are all resurfacing in certain countries and in political speeches.\\nIn January, we will commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by the Red Army. I do not know if anyone has visited Auschwitz, but I can say clearly that it changed me. In the camp, there are rooms filled with hair, rooms filled with glasses, rooms filled with prosthetic limbs, rooms filled with suitcases. Each item in these rooms was a life, a family. The people were condemned for being Jewish, for not espousing Nazi ideology, for being Gypsies, for being homosexuals, for being handicapped or simply being resisters. When I see that in certain countries there is a rise in revisionism, negationism, Nazism or Nazi ideology, I sometimes ask myself if we have ever truly learned anything from the Second World War.\\nLet me also say how unacceptable it is for State resources to be increasingly used to silence those who have dedicated themselves to the protection of human rights or the protection of the environment or to reporting the news. The work carried out within the Human Rights Council in Geneva on this issue is decisive and includes testimonies. Unfortunately, it is not only compliance with human rights that is being challenged. In recent years, we have seen the very existence of certain rights being called into question. We must admit that this is even true within our Organization’s forums, with regard to sexual and reproductive rights, which is adversely affecting programmes aimed at supporting the reproductive health of millions of women all over the world. I am convinced that this also applies to abortion and the right of every woman to make decisions about her own body.\\nIn the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a number of years ago women could still have an abortion for therapeutic reasons or if they are in distress. The law was changed. Abortion was no longer possible for women in distress or for therapeutic reasons. Women were forced to be interviewed by a panel of strangers. That law was changed immediately. I think that abortion is one of the most difficult decisions a woman must face. Every woman therefore needs to be heard and needs help. It is not the job of politics what is or is not good for her in this regard. It is a decision to be taken only after due reflection and help for the woman or couple concerned. It is not up to politics to say what is good for women, much less is it the job of men to decide what women should or should not do. This situation has become very difficult to tolerate and accept in 2020 — tomorrow — to tell the other sex what is good for her. The woman already has a difficult decision to make. Let us not make her life more difficult by trying to make them feel bad for making that decision.\\nIn 2020, we will also celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Conference, which strengthened the Commission on the Status of Women. I sometimes wonder if today we would be able to renew the commitments undertaken on that occasion, when I hear the positions and statements of some people on the rights of women.\\nThe same is true of the right to live according to one’s sexual orientation. Here in New York, I was able to launch a debate on hate speech against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and inter sex persons. A lot of work remains to be done. Homosexuality is not a choice. It is time to accept it as it is. What is a choice is homophobia. Let us not forget that.\\nThis year we are also commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, an almost universal convention. In this regard, I believe it is important to renew our commitments, including in the light of the developments that have taken place since its adoption, particularly in the field of climate and the digital economy.\\nMy country’s commitment to the promotion of human rights is part of its DNA, whether at the national, European or international level. It covers, without discrimination, the full range of rights recognized by our Organization, including economic and social rights. It is for these reasons that my country is a candidate for election as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2022-2024, for the first time since the Council was established. We count on the broad support of the General Assembly during the election in 2021.\\nI do not want to miss this opportunity to remind the Assembly how important it is that our Organization, which alone can claim to represent the international community, and which, in a way, is the international community itself, adapt to the realities of today’s world. The reforms initiated by the Secretary-General have made good progress. We must now translate them into action on the ground, particularly in terms of development and the organization of the security pillar.\\nThe adaptation efforts of all components of the United Nations system is a prerequisite for the living and dynamic multilateralism that the world needs. That was clearly the original goal of the signatories to the Charter of the United Nations, whose seventy-fifth anniversary we will have the opportunity to celebrate next year. Seventy-five years is also when Auschwitz was liberated, as I said earlier, and also when my country was liberated by the Allies. And, as I stand in our host State, the United States, I am convinced that 99.9 per cent of the soldiers buried in the American cemetery in my country would not even have been able to find Luxembourg on a map. Nevertheless, they fought so that I could live in peace. I will never forget our gratitude to the Allies and our host country. Today, I can live in freedom and freely express my opinion. These cemeteries are proof that war leaves scars that do not heal. We must never forget that.\\nThe summits and our debate this week have shown us that the United Nations is essential if we are to look to the future with clarity and address the challenges facing humankind today. My country is ready. The European Union is ready. Together with our partners in the international community, we want to ensure that we move forward together, because we know that the road is often long and sometimes difficult.\\nSo let us stop speaking about one another. Let us talk to one another.\\n', 'Never in the history of the world has humankind been more interconnected. Never in its history has humankind been better informed about events happening on the other side of the planet. And never have we been more acutely aware that we all face the same challenges — such challenges as climate change, migration, transnational crime and terrorism. They are global in nature and, therefore, by definition, require global responses. But instead of reproducing the heyday of international cooperation, as we should, multilateral diplomacy has entered a period of crisis.\\nThere are many examples of that development. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is no longer a global arrangement by all. Great Powers have withdrawn from longstanding disarmament treaties. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action hangs by a thread, which has led to a spiral of toughening positions. The United Nations and other multilateral organizations are often sidelined from solving conflicts, and, what is more, the Security Council often fails to achieve consensus on how to bring peace to the world’s worst crisis areas. I am deeply concerned by these developments.\\nLike many other small and medium-sized countries, Austria depends on negotiated solutions for addressing global problems. If the choice is between the rule of law and the law of the jungle, for Austria the answer is very clear: there needs to be a rules-based international order, where good governance, open markets and the notion of pacta sunt servanda prevail.\\nEveryone in this Hall is aware that multilateralism is hard work, often frustrating and has no easy wins or quick fixes, and that the need to compromise can be hard to sell to a domestic audience. But there is simply no alternative to international cooperation. Neither unilateralism nor multilateralism a la carte will solve any of the complex challenges we face.\\nThe European Union is built on cooperation and compromise, and I believe that we Europeans are therefore highly credible in reaffirming our commitment to rules-based multilateralism. Against this backdrop, I should like to address several global challenges that, in my view, urgently demand multilateral solutions.\\nThe first is climate change. The year 2018 has been the hottest on record in Austria. Our glaciers are melting away. Our Alpine regions are severely suffering. Climate change is truly a global challenge, which requires urgent global action.\\nAs a member of the High Ambition Coalition, we are fully committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and we support the Secretary-General’s call for the swift implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 13 at this week’s Climate Action Summit. In the coming years, Europe will work hard towards becoming the world’s first climate-neutral continent, which means net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. The Green New Deal in Europe, which the incoming European Commission has put forward, is very ambitious, and it sends a very strong signal to the world. However, such ambition should not be limited to Europe. At the High-level Political Forum, all States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed their commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Austria will present its first voluntary national review at next year’s High-level Political Forum. Our focus will be on climate, women and youth.\\nFor almost a decade, armed conflict has been raging in Syria and Iraq, with hundreds of thousands of victims and displaced persons. The so-called Islamic State has been defeated on the ground, but we owe it to the victims of its crimes to ensure that justice is delivered. Austria therefore continues to strongly support the referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. In addition, we believe that a special criminal tribunal should be established in the region to ensure accountability for the most serious crimes. This approach should go hand in hand with capacity- building for national justice to ensure due process.\\nToday, most conflicts are fought in cities and densely populated areas. In this urban warfare, international humanitarian law is often violated, with devastating consequences. When explosive weapons are used in populated areas, 91 per cent of the casualties, on average, are civilians. This is simply unacceptable. Clearly, we need to strengthen the protection of civilians. In order to emphasize the importance and urgency of this issue, Austria is bringing together in Vienna a broad alliance of partners next week, on 1 and 2 October 2019, for the first worldwide international conference on this topic. I cordially invite all Member States to attend.\\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is and remains a clear priority for Austria, and we are honoured to be serving on the Human Rights Council for the next three years. International humanitarian law and the universality of human rights are probably the greatest achievements of the modern global community. We must clearly stand up against any attempts to undermine them. Human rights are simply not negotiable. The international community has a duty to demand accountability when human rights are violated. We therefore welcome the independent investigations in Syria, Yemen and Myanmar.\\nAs geopolitical tensions have grown, so has the risk of military confrontation. After the disappointing end of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, we must avoid the deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe. We urge the United States and Russia to refrain from taking any steps in this direction and call for an extension of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.\\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use — on purpose or by accident — remains real. These weapons are inhumane and a danger to our security. The current narrative that nuclear weapons are somehow necessary for security is not only wrong: it is outright dangerous. The case for the total elimination of nuclear weapons is very clear. This is a moral imperative, but, more than that, what is at stake is the survival of humankind. We are therefore encouraged that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which Austria helped initiate, is now well on its way to entering into force. I call on all States to sign and ratify the Treaty and contribute to a world free of nuclear weapons. We also support initiatives to ban weapons that are fully autonomous. We cannot allow machines to decide issues of human life and death.\\nAt the outset, I shared with the Assembly my concern about the state of multilateralism. But at the same time, here in this Hall, I also feel hope. Why is that so? I feel this way because, once again, the United Nations high-level week has brought us all together: those that stress sovereignty and those who call for multilateralism, those who underline national priorities and those who seek international solutions, the patriots and the globalists — all together, here, at the United Nations, to talk, discuss and listen to each other. To me, this is multilateralism.\\nNext year, the United Nations will turn 75. That is a very respectable age and a reason to celebrate one of the greatest institutions ever created. However, we all know that the United Nations needs to be modernized. Austria therefore strongly supports the Secretary-General’s reform agenda.\\nThe global challenges we are all facing together require a strong United Nations. It is in all our interests. In May this year, in Vienna, we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Vienna International Centre, a hub for addressing security issues, including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, energy, sustainable development, the peaceful use of outer space and the fight against corruption, drugs and crime. I can assure members of the General Assembly that Austria is and will remain a proud and committed United Nations host country.\\nAll of us here in this Hall share the same responsibility for the effectiveness of the United Nations and the international order that we have built together over the past decades. As the Secretary-General put it, in a time of multiple complex challenges, multilateralism is the world’s best hope. Austria stands ready to assume its responsibilities as a member of the Human Rights Council, as host of the United Nations in Vienna, as a committed troop contributor to peacekeeping and as a candidate for membership of the Security Council in 2027-2028.\\n', 'Our world is changing rapidly. The values that have long served as guideposts are being challenged. The result is chaos — what can we cling to if nothing lasts? Can we still trust politics, the economy, international organizations? These are questions that will have to be answered in the context of our General Assembly.\\nLet us start with our values. In that regard, the Charter of the United Nations is our compass. In its Preamble, it affirms the fundamental rights and equality of all persons. It also speaks of the equality of nations. Relations between States should be governed by shared standards.\\nAllow me, as a representative of a small State, to dwell on this point. Several small countries have found that the principle of equality is too often violated. We are concerned about that trend. Often the strength of the large countries prevails over the rights of the small ones. Let me be clear — I did not come here to complain. I am simply reminding the Assembly that this is a reality that affects us all. Indeed, the smooth functioning of the international community depends on compliance with those principles — and it is not words but actions that count. Small States only have laws and rights to rely on, but it is up to the international community to uphold them for its own good.\\nLet me say a few more words about fundamental rights. This year will be the seventieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions — an incontestable landmark. Thanks to Geneva, Switzerland is the depositary of the Conventions. Humanitarian engagement is therefore at the heart of our foreign policy. As dedicated as we are to the cause of international humanitarian law, the list of its violations is long — too long. It is now up to all of us to make those values a reality. There is no more important or noble mission for us.\\nLet me also mention the pressing issues at hand — combating hunger, meeting water and energy needs, providing training for all, fighting climate change and reducing armed conflict. Those are just some of the challenges ahead. Periods of hope are succeeded by periods of despair. Our efforts in the past were often been rewarded when we were able to take advantage of the latest technological developments to benefit everyone. In large part, the progress of our civilization depends upon such innovations and how we share them.\\nInvesting in research and training creates the conditions for a world that offers more opportunities for all. If we want to have enough food, drinking water and energy for all in future, if we want to successfully fight climate change, we do not need declarations of intent — we need technical innovations. We must therefore invest in training and research. Knowledge must be freely shared. Technical progress must be encouraged, not stifled. The development of digital technologies could quickly generate considerable benefits.\\nDigital technology makes it possible to simplify processes. It also contributes to greater transparency. Digital technology will transform our world, our way of living together and our way of working. It can help us to accelerate the advent of a sustainable development model. The international community has set itself ambitious objectives in that respect in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. New technologies and innovation will give us the tools to achieve them.\\nAs everyone knows, Switzerland is one of the most important financial centres. We are committed to ensuring that our financial sector is beyond reproach. The financial sector has the ability to influence sustainable investment choices and to set an example. Together with a sensible use of new digital technologies, it can develop innovative, sustainable and attractive products. Let us have the courage to try something new and to say yes to the promises of tomorrow.\\nDigital technology also involves certain risks. Illicit practices and cyberattacks have become part of everyday life. The protection of privacy is also a fundamental right. It is up to the politicians to act and monitor the use of data. In that connection, I note that three weeks ago in Geneva we launched the Swiss Digital Initiative Foundation. It brings together the world’s leading suppliers of computer equipment and software, as well as several heavyweights in the industry, but also the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Facebook, Google and many others. What is it about? We want the new digital society to adopt common ethical rules. New technologies must inspire and win our trust. Any organization can join the initiative and demonstrate its commitment to progress and strong ethical values. It is evident that Switzerland is banking on digital technology and sees it as an opportunity in all areas. The initiative must follow clear rules that are in line with our common values. We invite all gathered here today to share our experience and cooperate with us.\\nFinally, let us talk a little bit about ourselves. I mean the United Nations. We want a strong Organization because it is the only global exchange platform that can help us meet the challenges ahead together. Certainly, the institution must be reformed, along lines we know well. In that regard, we assure the Secretary-General of our support to ensure that the Organization becomes more effective and focuses on its core missions. The United Nations depends on the trust placed in it — that trust is our capital.\\nSwitzerland declares its readiness to contribute to the smooth functioning of the United Nations. Geneva is an ideal platform in that regard — for decades it has been one of the capitals of humanitarian aid. It is the headquarters of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It is home to more than 400 non-governmental organizations and is now also the home of a global initiative dedicated to the ethical issues linked to digital technology.\\nThe world is changing, and that change sometimes causes confusion. Fortunately, we have values that help orient us. We call for equal rights for all — individuals and States. Law must prevail over force. That is our motto. In addition, thanks to new technologies, we have a tool that will enable us to meet the challenges of tomorrow. We are determined to be actively involved in addressing these challenges in future. Switzerland and Geneva stand at the ready.\\n', 'Here in New York over the past few days, we have all heard a great many speeches — at the Climate Action Summit, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the countless side events, and of course here at the speech-making marathon known as the general debate.\\nIf we were to analyse all the speeches, we would probably find that one term, “sustainability”, crops up more often than any other. Some think the term is nothing but hype, a marketing trend or a bit of greenwashing for the post-material elite. And as long we do nothing more than talk about sustainability, none of that will change. While we here in New York are talking about sustainability, we risk losing the race against climate change. The Earth is ablaze. While we are talking about sustainability, men, women, and children are suffering from starvation and epidemics. While we are talking about sustainability, people are dying as a result of wars and conflicts that we have been trying to resolve for years without success. Syria, Mali, Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea — the list is far too long. It is time to do more than just talk about sustainability. It is time to act sustainably, including in foreign and security policy.\\nA sustainable foreign policy is one that seeks lasting solutions to conflict and involves all stakeholders in order to ensure both acceptance and stability. It focuses on prevention rather than merely reacting to events. It relies on viable agreements, not speedy deals at others’ expense. All who love their countries will be committed to cooperation, because only if we work together will we all have a future. A sustainable foreign policy is a multilateral foreign policy. The United Nations is founded on that very principle, which is also the guiding principle for German and European foreign policy. I would like to provide four examples that make that clear.\\nFirst, concerning the situation in the Middle East, the attacks on two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia have shown us how fast things can escalate. Iran bears the responsibility for them, as we Europeans have made clear publicly and also at our meetings with the Iranian Foreign Minister. The only way to ease the tension is to hold talks between the United States and Iran, but that will happen only if no unrealistic preconditions are placed on such a dialogue. There is something else that we emphasized today at our meeting with Iran, Russia and China. We want to continue to adhere to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the goal of an Iran with no nuclear weapons, simply because it creates security and a basis for further talks with Iran on other topics that are important in that context. Ultimately, diplomacy means not getting bogged down in a logic of despair. But it also means sticking to mutual agreements. That is why we expect Iran to meet the obligations it entered into with us and the entire international community with regard to the JCPOA and to respond positively to our current European efforts to make progress on a diplomatic solution.\\nSecondly, with regard to Afghanistan, we very much regret that the terrible attacks by the Taliban sabotaged the talks with the United States in Doha. Germany closely followed and supported the talks from the outset. We are convinced that a sustainable solution to the conflict can come about only through political compromise. That is the only way we can ensure that peace endures in the long term. We owe that to all who have been engaged for a peaceful Afghanistan over the past 18 years, in some cases paying with their lives. For that reason, an agreement with the Taliban can also be only a first step. What we would then need would be intra-Afghan peace talks. Germany is ready to support those talks, not least in order to ensure that everything that the United Nations and the entire international community have worked for over almost two decades is not lost — a constitutional order, a minimum of stability, human rights and the rights of women and girls in particular.\\nThirdly, with regard to Ukraine, over the past two years, the Minsk process has more or less come to a standstill. Right there, in Europe, we have seen an aggression that has cost more than 13,000 lives. We will not simply sit back and accept it. The people in Ukraine want peace. President Zelenskyy has said that very clearly and made it one of his priorities, which has provided a new impetus. Take the bridge in Stanytsia Luhanska, for example. For four years it was a ruin. Now it is being rebuilt. Military equipment and soldiers are being withdrawn. At first glance it is a small step, just one piece of the disengagement called for by the Minsk process, but it is a huge step for the people who use the bridge each and every day. We want to seize that momentum. Together with France, we are working hard within the Normandy format to finally find solutions to issues that have been on the table for almost four years. After all, pursuing a sustainable foreign policy also means persistently pursuing goals, step by step. Standing still is not an option.\\nLastly, with regard to Syria, now in its ninth year of war, the idea of sustainable peace might almost seem naive, and yet today there are grounds for cautious hope. The creation of the Constitutional Committee is a first important step towards a political process. It will be crucial to ensure that the Committee begins work quickly and implements resolution 2254 (2015). Only when we finally get down to tackling the causes of conflict and address the Syrian people’s desire for social, economic and political participation can there be lasting peace in Syria. And reconstruction will be sustainable only when political progress is visible. Until then, Germany will not take part. Another element that is at least as important is justice. How can thousands of traumatized, tortured and displaced Syrians and victims of poison-gas attacks believe in peace if their tormentors go unpunished? The predominant impression now, and not only in Syria, is that even the worst crimes are not punished. International criminal law is under massive pressure. That is why, before the end of this week, we will establish an alliance against impunity, designed to strengthen international criminal jurisdiction. Without justice there can be no reconciliation or peace.\\nThose four examples show that sustainable foreign policy demands stamina, resilience and resolve. Above all, it means working together reliably. When we do cooperate, we are making progress, often outside the glare of publicity. In the Sudan, after 30 years, there is at long last hope of a truly new beginning. I was there recently and I assured those in positions of responsibility that we will continue to support the transformation through mediation, in the Security Council, as a troop contributor to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and as a donor. And it is not only in the Sudan that we support peace processes. I am therefore pleased to announce that Germany is doubling its contribution to the Peacebuilding Fund this year, from €15 million to €30 million.\\nIn Mali, United Nations Blue Helmets, including almost 1,000 Germans, are working to secure a fragile peace on a daily basis. The prerequisite for lasting stability is that the people regain confidence in the local security forces. That is why together with France we have established a partnership for security and stability in the Sahel, and we call on all Member States to join us.\\nA solution has yet to be found in the conflict in Libya. We support the United Nations and the tireless efforts of Special Representative Salame. An international process involving the supporters of the parties to the conflict is the only way forward. We want to take on responsibility in that regard, too, and together with the Special Representative, we have launched a process intended to lead to achieving peace.\\nGermany has now been a non-permanent member of the Security Council for nine months, and the impression I have is that far too often, crises and conflicts are not discussed in the Council until shots have been fired and people are dying. That is the very opposite of sustainable policymaking, because at that point it is already too late. The Security Council must move from being a crisis-response body to a crisis- prevention body. And, finally, it must also examine the causes of conflicts. That is why we put climate and security on the agenda at the very beginning of our term and will ensure that it remains there. Climate change has long ceased to be merely an ecological challenge for humankind. More and more often it is a matter of war and peace. Climate change is no less than a question of humankind’s survival. If people no longer have access to clean drinking water, if entire harvests are ruined by persistent drought and conflicts break out over the few remaining resources, the wars of the future will be climate wars. Climate protection must therefore become an imperative in a sustainable foreign policy.\\nDuring our membership of the Council we are also focusing on the role of women. Sexual violence continues to be used as a tactic of war. That is abhorrent and perverse. With the adoption of resolution 2467 (2019) in April, we were able to help ensure better support for survivors of sexual violence, but more is at stake here. Stable peace is 33 per cent more likely to be achieved if women are involved in the process. We are therefore committed to seeing an increase in the number of women peacekeepers. Only eight of every 100 seats at peace talks are currently occupied by women. That is nothing short of negligent. To put it simply, peace efforts will not work if 51 per cent of the world’s population is excluded. We will therefore continue to do whatever we can to fight for an equal world. That is not just a matter of justice but one of human decency and human reason.\\nWe will also continue to fight in the Security Council for disarmament and arms control. It was thanks to us that in April the subject of nuclear-arms control was put back on the Council’s agenda for the first time in seven years — I repeat, seven years — although if one thing is absolutely clear it is that we can build security only if we work with and not against one another. That is why many States are calling strongly and with increasing impatience for a return to concrete, realistic steps towards disarmament, especially in the nuclear field, and that is why those States that have yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must finally do so. Following the launch of the disarmament initiative at an international ministerial meeting held in Stockholm in June, we would like to place nuclear disarmament issues firmly on the international agenda ahead of the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I am looking forward to welcoming the supporters of the initiative to Berlin next year.\\nCollaboration, compromise and the defence of our joint rules and institutions are what we understand by sustainability in foreign policy. More than most other countries, Germany has benefited from the rules-based order over the past 70 years. Peace, prosperity, free trade and a world open to the outside, as well as a liberal society within, are inextricably linked to multilateralism. Never going it alone again — that is a lesson from our history. Precisely because it was Germany that 80 years ago unleashed fire and destruction in Europe and the world, we must assume a special responsibility today for an order that secures peace. That is why we set up the Alliance for Multilateralism last year. We do not agree with the idea that if everyone thinks only of themselves, everyone has been thought of, because in the end that means only “everyone against everybody else”. The truth is that not one of the major issues of the future confronting us today can be resolved by one country acting alone. Only if we work together will we find answers to globalization, the digital revolution, migration and human-induced climate change.\\nCooperation is not a betrayal of one’s own country. Rather, it creates the prerequisites for our countries’ security and prosperity. In the past 12 months, countries from all parts of the world that share that view have joined together in the Alliance for Multilateralism. Tomorrow, more than 50 of my colleagues will be meeting here in New York to agree on concrete steps to strengthen international law and human rights and to discuss disarmament, crisis prevention, peacebuilding and global issues for the future, such as cybertechnology and climate change. That is multilateralism in practice. That is sustainable foreign policy. Sustainable development is not a principle of lofty discourse or an elite approach that only the wealthy can afford. On the contrary, we can no longer afford not to act sustainably.\\n', 'During the general debate of the General Assembly, all the States Members of the United Nations make their voices heard, and I am proud to be standing in this Hall representing the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is made up of four autonomous countries located in Europe and the Caribbean: the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. We are familiar with both the trade winds of the tropics and the cold gales of the North Sea. Anyone wishing to understand our character can best begin with a concept that is close to the heart of everyone in our Kingdom — freedom.\\nOver the coming year, we will be celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of our liberation from oppression and tyranny. From the city of Amsterdam to the smallest villages, there will be commemorations and celebrations by old and young alike. The Caribbean part of the Kingdom will also reflect on its own contribution to the allied struggle. We remain forever grateful to our allies both in and beyond Europe for the sacrifices that they made for our sake. This collective remembrance still moves and inspires us today.\\nFor our Kingdom, freedom is bound up with cooperation with other countries, based on equality, justice, honest relations and international law. That is why we were involved in building the United Nations from its inception, and why we look forward to next year, when we will celebrate its seventy-fifth anniversary. As a platform for managing international conflicts and creating opportunities for people across the entire world, the United Nations is unparalleled in history.\\nWe believe in multilateral cooperation. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is convinced that close collaboration within a broad-based partnership of States offers the best guarantee of freedom, security and prosperity for all. The fight against poverty and inequality is best served by joining forces at the international level. We believe that it is vital to express that clearly here in the General Assembly, given the pressure that that cooperation is under. We should cherish the multilateral system and its international agreements and rules as a precious achievement. Let us appreciate the value of what has been carefully built over many years. Let us acknowledge that we need one another, just as we did 75 years ago. In fact, we need each other more than ever. “The future we want, the United Nations we need” is the motto of next year’s session — a motto that offers plenty of food for thought. What kind of future do we want? Anyone who asks their children that question will get a clear answer. Our young people want a fair, clean and sustainable world that gives them the freedom to develop as individuals and discover who they are, where no one is left behind or has to fear violence, want or oppression. If we listen to the voices of the young, it is clear where we need to look for solutions. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will bring the world imagined by those young people closer. That is why it is essential that we put all our energies into achieving them.\\nWe are concerned about the fact that in several countries and regions, young people risk losing all hope of a better future. One example is Venezuela, which is a neighbour of the Caribbean part of our Kingdom. We fervently hope that a way can be found out of the current stalemate by means of free and fair elections. In many places around the world people are not free to be themselves. In many places, there is no room for diversity, no respect for the rights and opportunities of minorities and no equality between men and women. As a result, breeding grounds for instability endure.\\nAfter all, every human being strives for recognition. If that recognition is denied, tensions and conflict are inevitable. We must hold firmly to the principle of freedom of religion or belief, including for minorities in places where the great majority profess a different faith. No one can prescribe how another person should think. Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews and people without religious convictions should be able to follow their own conscience in peace everywhere.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands welcomes the fact that the rights of lesbian, gay and transgender people and other minority communities are being enshrined in law in more and more places around the world. We hope that that trend continues. But, ultimately, words must translate into action. The fight against discrimination, whether open or hidden, must continue on every continent.\\nIf we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we must protect human rights. The Kingdom of the Netherlands wants to work with all Member States to champion that aim. We have therefore announced our candidacy for a seat on the Human Rights Council from 2020 to 2022, and we hope to have the support of everyone here in the election this autumn. Human rights are for everyone, even those who have committed crimes and are punished for them. People are not infallible, which means that the administration of justice is not infallible either. An irreversible sentence can never be justified. The death penalty is a violation of the fundamental right to life. That is why the Netherlands, together with all other members of the European Union, advocates the abolition of capital punishment worldwide.\\nWe care deeply about the plight of those who are victims of war and violence. Many are refugees and many have reached the point of despair. It is essential that people whose rights are trampled underfoot know that the United Nations is on their side. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is actively involved in the Secretary-General’s efforts to make United Nations peace missions more effective. The Action for Peacekeeping initiative is a crucial part of that process. It is equally important that we take effective action to combat terrorism and eliminate the factors that fuel it. As co-Chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum, the Netherlands is firmly committed to that goal. Anyone guilty of genocide, war crimes, terrorism or human trafficking must be held to account. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is determined to combat impunity. This week, we will be hosting an event aimed at encouraging the criminal prosecution of fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, preferably in the region where they committed their atrocities. We will also continue our efforts to strengthen the International Criminal Court, which is an indispensable component of the international legal order. It is unacceptable for individuals responsible for international crimes to escape their just punishment. In this forum, I want to repeat that under Security Council resolution 2166 (2014), all countries, including Russia, must cooperate fully with efforts to establish the truth about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 on 17 July 2014. The families of the 298 victims expect justice, and we will not rest until justice is done.\\nHuman rights, peace and development opportunities for all are the cornerstones of the world order that we seek to build, and they are at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals. Everyone deserves the chance to build a decent life and find respite in times of adversity. To that end, the United Nations is working with Member States in all manner of ways. But we are not working fast enough. At our current pace, we will not achieve our goals by 2030 in the area of reducing inequality, for example. We can and must speed up our efforts. The international community has shown in the past that it is capable of great things. Thirty years ago, one in three people lived in extreme poverty. Today that figure is one in 10. We have made a huge leap forward in just one generation. Let us take heart from that and put all our energies into reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. Among the many people working on those goals is my wife, the Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development. For 10 years now, she has fulfilled that role with enormous drive, passion and pleasure.\\nAnyone who champions sustainable development must also champion climate action. Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the achievement of the SDGs. All over the world, people are feeling its impact. Climate change is affecting our livelihoods, security, health, living environments and future. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development demands that we all take more action to combat climate change. The Secretary-General deserves praise for giving this issue such a prominent place in the General Assembly. Never before has international cooperation been so urgent for the future of our planet. Greenhouse gases do not recognize national borders. We can combat climate change only if we work together, and we are glad to heed the call to take responsibility and show ambition. Transitioning to a sustainable, circular economy is no simple task. Every Member State is wrestling with that challenge, including our Kingdom, and that is precisely why we all need one another. We must join forces and share our knowledge and experience.\\nIn the Netherlands, the Government, municipalities, the business community, civil society and the general public have joined together with the goal of almost halving emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. At the same time, we are partnering with Costa Rica to help developing countries that want to raise their climate ambitions and take action. The Nationally Determined Contributions Partnership is a vital platform in that regard, and we strongly urge the private sector to play its part and make greening a priority. As a country with more than 1,000 years of experience in water management, the Netherlands is also an expert partner for anyone working to enhance flood protection. We are proud that Dutch engineers and water managers are doing their part all over the world. What is more, next year we will be hosting the international Climate Adaptation Summit.\\nAs we approach next year’s celebrations to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the Kingdom of the Netherlands sees this as a time for reflection. How can we ensure that as the twenty-first century unfolds, the United Nations remains fit for purpose? After the horrors of two world wars, we created a multilateral system based on dialogue and cooperation, a system that places international agreements and rules above ultranationalism and power-based spheres of influence. As a result, we have improved the lives of billions of people and made our world more secure, and that is a unique achievement.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands believes in the need for an effective multilateral system because it offers the best guarantee of stability, peace and sustainable development. That does not mean that we can simply carry on the way we were. Reforms are needed in order to prevent the system from coming to a standstill and losing its credibility. The reforms initiated by the Secretary-General must be put into practice as a matter of urgency. He has our full support. In order to achieve that, it is crucial that Member States honour their financial commitments. It is also essential that United Nations organizations improve their cooperation and that financial resources be spent smartly and efficiently in order to achieve the best possible return for the people they are intended to help. Every person counts; every Member State counts. The United Nations will have an inclusive future or no future at all. The voices of small island developing States must therefore be heard more at the United Nations level, because their concerns have too often fallen on deaf ears.\\nTogether, we can make our world greater. So let us remember where we began, 75 years ago. Let us realize that the building of an international framework for cooperation has given billions of people hope, security and confidence. Let us retain those achievements and uphold the values of the United Nations. But at the same time, let us rejuvenate our United Nations so it is fit for purpose in today’s world.\\n', 'Mr. President,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nDear friends,\\nWe will remember this year — 2020. What a year! We cannot meet as we usually do in the Hall, which, once a year, is the centre of our world. New York, which is the most open city in existence, where all our meetings are held, cannot welcome us. For many long weeks, it has been an epicentre of the global health crisis, and I would like to pay special tribute to it here.\\nThe COVID-19 crisis has had an impact on everyone and in all areas, including the most prosaic and banal aspects of daily life. How do we visit our loved ones, our family? How do we get to work? How do we cope with online learning? How do we shop? How do we play sports? And these are the concerns of those who have or had a full-time job, social security and access to health care.\\nAs Head of Government, I have had to deal with all facets of this crisis and swift decisions had to be taken, with significant consequences on the lives of citizens, the functioning of public services, economic activity and the funding of anti-crisis measures. This remains the common plight of all Governments around the world. But beyond that, all of us, citizens of this planet, are in this crisis together and only together will we emerge from it.\\nWe face a global emergency. The crisis has affected all regions of the world almost at the same time. It has been compounded by restrictions on civil liberties, a return of borders, a re-examination of the gains made in the areas of free trade and economic integration and unprecedented challenges to public and private health-care systems, not to mention the ethical issues that many of us have not faced for quite some time.\\nAt the beginning of the health crisis, we in Europe acted quickly to protect our national space and that response continues today. The free movement of people in the European Union was also challenged, at times far beyond what would be considered reasonable. The time has come for European action at the health, social and economic levels. Historic decisions have been taken to ensure a way out of the crisis and an environmentally-friendly recovery and to meet the challenges of sustainable development. We will continue to be tested in the coming months but I believe that we will be successful at the national and European levels.\\nIn addition to the temptation to focus solely on ourselves, we have also seen an, at times, a level of extraordinary international cooperation between State and institutional actors, in particular in the field of scientific research. Formidable efforts are under way to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. However, only by ensuring equitable global access to a vaccine will we put an end to this pandemic.\\nWe have also seen a myriad of concrete examples of solidarity among countries and peoples, for example, in the case of medical evacuations. Responses to the challenges of the severity of the crisis have also led to the improvement and adaptation of medical and health equipment on the ground and to strengthening the resilience of rapid-response systems.\\nThat said, we know that, globally, the situation in a large number of countries is of great concern. The COVID-19 crisis has become a health crisis that extends beyond COVID-19 because of the burden it places on health-care systems, and, more generally, because we now question the strategies used to combat other diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. The disruption of supply chains and obstacles to the distribution of personal protective equipment and other materials have also posed a major challenge. In this regard, I would like to thank the States that helped us acquire personal protective equipment at the height of the crisis.\\nMr. President,\\nFriends,\\nThe dire warnings from the World Food Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are simply frightening. There is a genuine risk that famine could return in large parts of the world, beyond conflict zones or countries hit by recent natural disasters.\\nThe social crisis has a disproportionate adverse effect on the countless people who survive on the informal economy and are deprived of resources in developed economies.\\nThe economic crisis affects all countries and in particular developing countries. Emerging countries have not been spared. These countries cannot guarantee the resilience of their social security or health systems in response to the crisis. Nor do they have the means to fund their emergence from the crisis through the capital market. Proportionally, their debt burden is much higher than that of developed countries.\\nLuxembourg fully supports efforts to establish a moratorium and reduce the debt burden of the least developed countries.\\nFinancing needs are again on the rise for developing countries, whose progress could be rolled back 20 years. However, the means of meeting those needs may be lacking.\\nOfficial development assistance must continue to play a key role. In the current circumstances — all the more so now than prior to the COVID-19 crisis — assistance cannot be mortgaged with the vagaries of financing through the capital market or other financial instruments, however innovative they may be. I say this even as my country leads in the area of microfinance, in particular in Africa.\\nLuxembourg’s official development assistance will remain at 1 per cent of its gross national income, in addition to its international climate and migration expenditure.\\nThe role of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda is to ensure financing for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The initiative of the Secretary-General, together with the Prime Ministers of Canada and Jamaica, to convene a high-level meeting on financing sustainable development post-COVID-19 should be welcomed. It will provide an opportunity to gain a comprehensive overview of an issue that is often addressed piecemeal in forums with very different processes. This does not mean that the proven expertise of institutions, such as the Paris Club or the OECD, should not be revisited and even expanded.\\nLuxembourg’s financial centre is fully involved in efforts to develop sustainable financing. The green stock exchange of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is one of the largest and most active in the world. Last week we launched a green bond that has been remarkably successful, with demand 10 times greater than the initial offer.\\nWe are now working to extend the climate finance model to other Sustainable Development Goals.\\nI just mentioned one of the high-level meetings of this session. There are other meetings at which the representatives of Luxembourg will make a statement or have already made a statement. The event to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the Summit on Biodiversity and the Beijing +25 meeting are of particular interest.\\nWhat does this demonstrate? It shows that even in extremely difficult circumstances, our Organization is capable of consultation, proposals and action.\\nAs early as March and April, the Secretary-General submitted a series of COVID-19-related analyses that paved the way for resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.\\nMr. President,\\nThe Assembly has been able to respond to the challenges posed by the crisis and take decisions that were crucial for the smooth functioning of the Organization thanks to the efforts of your predecessor. In the absence of physical meetings and despite the procedural limitations this entailed, the Assembly has demonstrated to the world that the United Nations was indeed present in meeting the challenges posed by the crisis. The management of the Assembly has set an example on how to sensibly improvise. I believe that, in the future, we will have to consider other arrangements to offset the disadvantages of consensus decision-making.\\nOur Assembly has also prepared for the future by adopting a series of substantive resolutions designed to provide a United Nations response to the crisis. The adoption of the Omnibus resolution, which gives coherence to our approach, should be particularly noted and welcomed. At its special session in December, the General Assembly will have the opportunity to review the system’s response and initiatives that might be adopted in the future.\\nThe Security Council was somewhat slow to act on our Secretary-General’s call in the early spring for an immediate global ceasefire. Thanks to the persistence of some of its members, it finally did so, but it must be said that the obstacles that were encountered in the process are unfortunately emblematic of the Council’s difficulty to act and make decisions even in the most urgent situations.\\nWhile New York-based United Nations agencies, such as UNDP and UNICEF, were of course quick to react, so were United Nations agencies based elsewhere. I am thinking of those based in Rome that had to act to address the food emergency and the emerging danger of starvation.\\nRecent experiences in global health governance can and should be reviewed in the aftermath of the current pandemic, and the relevant key lessons should be learned. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the appropriate agency to conduct such a review. Its role in global health governance needs to be strengthened. We are confident that that will enable us to better deal with future pandemics.\\nMr. Chairman,\\nDear friends,\\nI said earlier that the world is in danger of undoing 20 years of development with regard to a significant number of Members of the Organization. Unfortunately, I do not see those as the only achievements at risk. The COVID-19 crisis has further incentivized curtailing civil liberties excessively. In many regions and States, civic space is shrinking dramatically. The suppression of opponents and human rights defenders is becoming widespread. When it is suppressed, civil society is often not heard. At the General Assembly during its seventy-fourth session, the Luxembourg chairmanship of the Third Committee committed to ensuring that civil society receive its rightful place in that forum, which is responsible for dealing with human rights issues. Civil Society’s involvement in United Nations forums will be one of our priorities as a candidate in the Human Rights Council elections to be held in October 2021.\\nOverall, we are concerned about the rise of authoritarianism, to our dismay, in every region of the world — which is at times manifests itself more covertly and deviously, and, at others, openly, as we have recently seen in Belarus. The rise of authoritarianism often goes hand in hand with a rise in simplistic populist, and even anti-scientific and irrational, narratives.\\nUnfortunately, backsliding in the progress made in the recognition of certain rights also affects sexual and reproductive health, spilling over into United Nations bodies. With regard to my country, which is pursuing a feminist foreign policy, maintaining the gains made over many years of struggle must remain an absolute priority. We demonstrated that during our recent chairmanship of the Commission on Population and Development.\\nI also take this opportunity to recall my country’s commitment to defending the rights of sexual minorities and its active participation in the LGBTI Core Group. In that regard, Europe is unfortunately of concern.\\nMr. President,\\nAuthoritarianism fuels conflicts as it thrives on them. One has only to look at the number of regions and countries that have become the arena of diverse geographic Powers, entailing all kinds of trafficking and migratory pressures, especially in the Mediterranean.\\nThe Middle East remains a hotbed of tension. I welcome the recent rapprochement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Bahrain, which should help stabilize the region. Nevertheless, the peace process between Israel and Palestine has stalled. The parties’ commitment is needed to negotiate a just and lasting peace and reach a two-State solution living side by side in peace and security. While Iran’s actions in the region give cause for concern, the abandonment of the nuclear agreement with Iran is not likely to improve the situation. The agreement remains in force and cannot be simultaneously rejected and invoked.\\nLet me say a few words about the situation in West Africa and the Sahel. Much of my country’s international cooperation is focused there. All stakeholders of the region must come together by implementing the commitments made, including the restoration of civil authority in Mali. The effectiveness of the international community’s commitment is predicated on that. For its part, Luxembourg further strengthened its commitment at the beginning of the year through its direct participation in MINUSMA, the first such involvement since its participation in UNPROFOR and UNIFIL.\\nI will not list the concerns that my country has about active or potential conflicts in every region of the world. The list would be too long. It must be noted that sources of tension are on the rise and that the appearance of new actors on the international scene hardly always leads towards calm.\\nCalling into question multilateralism is playing its role in increasing risks. It is more and more frequent and is not the product a single actor of the international community, as one would like to make us believe on occasion. For our part, we adhere to an international order based on the rule of law and the sovereignty of States. There is no contradiction between the two.\\nI take this occasion to reiterate my country’s full support for the International Criminal Court and its representatives. The recent attacks against the Court and obstacles created to prevent it from acting must cease.\\nThe United Nations is the umbrella organization of the international system and, as such, the guarantor of multilateralism. In our globalized and interdependent world, isolated and uncoordinated action constitutes a risk for all, including those who do not feel bound by accepted norms. The coronavirus crisis reminds us of that in the clearest and most unmistakable way.\\nFor its part, Luxembourg will maintain its long-standing international commitment through its participation in the work of the universally participatory bodies of the Organization, its voluntary financial contributions, its presence on the ground together with the United Nations and its candidature to elected positions in various bodies, such as the Human Rights Council for the term from 2022 to 2024.\\nI sincerely hope that next year I will once again be able to participate more directly in the great conversation that is the high-level week and address the Assembly in a more lively and interactive way.\\nMr. President,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nDear friends,\\nI thank everyone for their kind attention and for listening to me, and I hope to see everyone physically once again in the very near future.', 'President of the General Assembly, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Heads of State and Government, ladies and gentlemen,\\nLast year, we met in New York for the General Assembly, and I called on each and every one of you to have the courage to build peace and shoulder our responsibilities together. Such courage, I must say, has been more than severely tested by a health, economic, social and security crisis of an unprecedented scale, which immediately became global, never before seen since the establishment of our Organization 75 years ago. That courage came first and foremost from those who were on the front line from the beginning, all around the world, and who are still there today, providing medical treatment, food, assistance and physical and moral support — our health-care personnel and humanitarian workers. With these opening words, I wish to place them in our thoughts. They are relying on us to commit to and build concrete responses together, since this crisis, clearly more than any other, requires cooperation and requires us to devise new international solutions.\\nFirst of all, I believe in science and knowledge, and humankind will defeat this pandemic; a cure will be found. But, in the meantime, and no one knows how long that will be, each of our countries have no other choice but to learn to live with the virus, and the world will have to learn to live with this new reality that we cannot escape, revealing our weaknesses and placing us before our immediate responsibilities. That new global reality is clear, brutal and certainly dizzying, and we must approach it without giving in to despair and despondency, but with clear-sightedness. All the challenges that we faced were intensified and exacerbated within a few months. The successes achieved were hampered and setbacks accumulated.\\nYears of progress in the fight against other infectious diseases, such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which we thought we could eradicate, have been delayed, or worse. More than 37 million people have fallen into, or fallen back into, extreme poverty. Food insecurity is a serious threat, and it has increased. More than 1 billion students have been affected by schools closing in more than 160 countries. Forty million children have been deprived of their first year of education. Women have been on the front line and have seen all forms of sexual, domestic and gender-based violence build up against them.\\nIn the light of that and the many other effects of the pandemic that has struck our planet and which continues to affect every continent, our means of collective action has further fragmented. While the only solution will be found through our cooperation, the international organizations that we crucially need, such as the World Health Organization, have been accused by some of complacency, while others manipulate them. Trusted third-party scientists and journalists, who are so essential to our understanding and ability to efficiently respond to the crisis, have been undermined by State propaganda, as well as the misinformation epidemic. Our Organization risked powerlessness. The Security Council, the guarantor of peace and stability, struggled to agree on a humanitarian truce that we supported with all our strength. Just imagine. We struggled so much to agree on so little. But the permanent members were unable, in such exceptional circumstances, to come together as we would have liked, because two of them chose to demonstrate their rivalry rather than collective effectiveness. All of fractures that existed before the pandemic — the hegemonic clash of Powers, the undermining and the manipulation of multilateralism and the trampling of international law — have only increased and deepened due to the global destabilization created by the pandemic.\\nWe can no longer turn a blind eye. We no longer have the option or, if I may say, luxury to dither. The pandemic must be a wake-up call for our Organization, and a moment of redemption. That is possible because, in this challenge, we have seen signs of hope.\\nAs a result of the crisis, the European Union, which many predicted would become divided and powerless, has taken a historic step towards unity, sovereignty, solidarity and a vision of the future. It was Europe that, together with its African partners, took the initiative at the Group of Twenty (G-20) to help the most vulnerable countries to tackle the pandemic and ease the debt burden that weighs on economies and jeopardizes the continent’s future. For the first time at a G-20 finance meeting, we agreed a debt moratorium for the poorest countries in Africa. It was Europe that, with its partners, created the ACT-A initiative so that resources to combat the pandemic would be accessible to all. Thanks to Europe, along with others, the World Health Assembly decided to learn lessons from the pandemic and improve early-warning and response systems to better prevent such crises. It was Europe that, together with its partners in Asia, America and Africa, has had the drive to develop, propose and provide tangible solutions through cooperation, solidarity and action.\\nIn the future, we will need to take into account these new balances that are currently taking shape. We will need to rely on the strength of goodwill, because the world, as it is today, cannot come down to rivalry between China and the United States, no matter the global weight of those two great Powers, no matter the history that binds us together, particularly to the United States of America. The crisis, the collapse of our cooperation frameworks and the fragilities that I have just mentioned mean that we must rebuild a new order and that Europe must accept its full share of responsibility. That means upholding its values and its affinity for the future and building new solutions because we are not collectively condemned to a dance of power, which would, in a way, reduce us to merely being the sorry spectators of collective powerlessness. We have room to manoeuvre; it is up to us to make use of that space and to define our priorities in such an environment. We need to establish our choices clearly and build new partnerships. In the coming weeks and months, there will be fundamental choices to be made and decisions to be taken before our peoples and the international community. Those choices will have an immediate impact on the life of our nations, the existence of our citizens and the global course. We must not shy away from them, because it is precisely when things become shaky that we must get back to what is important. And I have very strongly believed, since the start of the present COVID-19 crisis, that this is not some sort of parenthesis that has opened and will reclose; this is what arises in a world beset by deep-seated crises stemming from our very interdependencies. There will undoubtedly one day be a cure for the pandemic, but there will be no miracle cure for the destruction of the modern order. There will be no miracle cure for the sort of paradox in which we are immersed. Our societies have never been so interdependent. And at the very moment when all this is taking place, never have we been so out of tune, so out of alignment, so incapable of building quick solutions — so wrapped up in our own situations as even to destroy the frameworks for cooperation we managed to build throughout the past decades.\\nThis is why I wanted to lay out before this Assembly the five priorities on which France wishes — primarily with its European partners, but also with all the powers of goodwill, that is to say with all those prepared to engage in doing so — to lay the foundations for a new modern consensus that will allow us to act concretely in the world as it is.\\nThe first principle, or the first objective, is the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and against terrorism, the leading threats to our collective security.\\nThe strategy of maximum pressure, pursued for several years, has not yet made it possible to put an end to the destabilizing activities of Iran, or to ensure that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons. That is why France, which, you will remember, was not the country that initiated the negotiations at the time, then designed the JCPOA. But France, with its German and British partners, will continue demanding the full implementation of the 2015 Vienna Agreement and will not accept the violations committed by Iran. However, we will not compromise on the activation of a mechanism that the United States, on its own, when leaving the agreement, is not in a position to activate. That would undermine the unity of the Security Council and the integrity of its decisions, and it would run the risk of further aggravating tensions in the region. But we need to build over time a useful framework for action, as I recalled before the General Assembly now more than two years ago — that is to say, the capacity to implement the 2015 agreement. First, promptly, to ensure that, in the long term, Iran will never gain access to nuclear weapons, but also to ensure that we will respond to Iran’s ballistic activity and destabilization of the region.\\nOn North Korea, we supported the efforts of the United States of America to pave the way for negotiations to begin. Even though tangible results are yet to be attained, these initiatives were important, and what we are waiting for now are concrete gestures of commitment from North Korea. It must comply with the resolutions of the Security Council and engage promptly and in good faith in a process of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. This is the only possible way to achieve a political solution and lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. It essential for regional stability and security as well as for international peace and security.\\nLikewise, we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons in Europe, in Russia or in Syria. In the name of collective security, I repeat here to Russia the need for light to be fully shed on the attempted assassination of a member of the political opposition using a novichok nerve agent. This investigation must be swift and full, as we will enforce our red lines. And, in this area, France has always fully applied its red lines set since I have been President of the Republic. Our collective security also means fighting terrorism wherever necessary. Terrorism struck on French soil, and in our flesh, several times in recent years, with terrorist acts at times fomented in the very heart, at the epicentre, of Islamist terrorism. I am thinking, in particular, of the 2015 attacks planned in Syria. This is why France will always be strongly committed to the Levant and in support of Iraqi sovereignty, and stands alongside its Sahelian partners. In the Levant, we will remain committed members of the international coalition. We won an initial victory in ending the territorial caliphate. That victory did not signal an end to the war in the region. We will continue to fight against all terrorists in the context of the international coalition and alongside all our regional partners. Here I wish to recall the role Kurdish fighters played in Syria alongside the coalition against Da’esh and the terrorists. I also wish to recall the essential role that Iraq and its people played and continue to play in this fight. This is why France strongly supports all the initiatives Iraq is taking today and will continue to take for its sovereignty and its role in the fight against terrorism.\\nIn the Sahel, France is, as you know, deeply involved, primarily alongside the five States of the Sahel. The Pau and Nouakchott summits made it possible to lay the groundwork for a coalition to strengthen the fight against our two enemies in this region, the Islamic State and Al-Qaida. Both organizations have suffered unprecedented setbacks in recent months. The objectives set in Pau, to focus on the tri-border region and the ISGS, produced unprecedented tangible results. We will continue these efforts. With the support of Barkhane and our European and American partners, the G-5 Sahel armies have regained the advantage, reclaiming positions that had been lost. This dynamic must continue. This is the very purpose of the coalition we are building. Events in Mali over recent weeks further remind us of the obvious: democracy and the fight against terrorism go hand in hand. These two struggles are inextricable. And only democracy, justice, the rule of law and development will restore lasting peace to the Sahel. Those who entered Mali in the name of these principles must not now betray them. They must put Mali irreversibly on track towards the restoration of civilian authority and the prompt holding of elections. France, like its African partners in particular, can only remain engaged on this condition. I will say it and repeat it very clearly: France is only present on Malian soil, as on the soil of other countries in the region, at the request of sovereign States and regional organizations. The very second those States want us to leave or believe they can fight terrorism on their own, we will withdraw. I therefore asked for reiteration, in Pau then in Nouakchott, of that request, that need for our involvement, which was also reconfirmed by the junta in Mali. And we will remain highly vigilant on this point. I believe in the sovereignty of peoples, and I think that our fight against terrorism can be meaningful and sustainable only if it is combined with respect for that sovereignty, along with effective democracy and a genuine development policy such as the one we designed with the Alliance for the Sahel, which, along with our European and African partners as well as the World Bank, we are continuing to develop in order to undertake constructive action on the ground.\\nThe second priority for the coming months, in my view, is the demanding task of building peace and stability with respect for the sovereign equality of peoples. The grammar of peace and stability must be redefined, because the lines have shifted radically as a result of the crisis; in fact, they had changed well before it. The withdrawal of America, which acted as the guarantor of last resort of an international system that is now struggling; the hegemonic assertion of other Powers as a result of that disengagement; China’s projection beyond its borders; and the strengthening of European sovereignty are all underlying trends that should lead us to rethink the modalities of our collective action aimed at ensuring peace and security. Our policy principles in this respect must be clear, and we must no longer hesitate to apply them: respect for the sovereign rights of peoples, the consolidation of States based on the rule of law and of their means of implementation, and the requirement and responsibility to ensure the effective implementation of the decisions taken under the auspices of the United Nations.\\nThat is exactly what we are doing in Lebanon, where the aspirations of the sovereign Lebanese people must be respected, heard and supported despite the unacceptable transgressions of the Lebanese political class. I wish to reiterate here my full support for the Lebanese people and my determination to act from where I am and with full respect for Lebanese sovereignty, in a spirit of friendship and expectation, as I have so often said, so that Lebanon can recover, so that life there can improve and in order to chart the course towards conciliation and a more effective democracy. But Lebanon is a treasure for all humankind — a treasure because it represents a form of exception, democracy and pluralism in a region that is caught in the grip of terrorism and hegemonic Powers. The United Nations, as it has been doing this summer and over the long term, must work together with civil society and non-governmental organizations in order to tackle immediate needs and begin reconstruction. Here too we will remain fully committed.\\nIn Syria, the resumption of talks in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations is a positive step, but this process cannot be limited to the drafting of a new constitution. It will have to involve the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in order to ensure respect for the aspirations and sovereignty of the Syrian people. France and its European partners will therefore continue to base the financing of reconstruction and the normalization of relations with Damascus on the implementation of a credible political solution, which is the only sustainable solution and the only one that will make it possible to eradicate terrorism in the region.\\nPeace in the Middle East remains a necessity, first and foremost for the Israelis and the Palestinians, but also for us all. I welcome the fact that Israel has been recognized by additional Arab countries. That is legitimate recognition. It is also a pledge of hope for the future. However, a just and lasting peace requires above all a path back to decisive negotiations that will allow the Palestinians to finally exercise their rights. There is no alternative to courageous negotiations, which will require agreement on the most difficult issues while respecting the legitimate aspirations of the parties to full recognition of their security and sovereignty. I do not believe in peace built on hegemony or humiliation, even if financial compensation is provided, because we know all too well that money cannot compensate for the humiliation of a people. It is up to us, collectively, to work towards that ambitious solution.\\nIn Libya, the crisis is now having a profound impact on regional stability and has been aggravated by increased outside interference. In my view, Libya is the perfect example of the mistakes that we ourselves could make if we fail to respect the sovereignty of peoples. No Power can seek the good of a people unless the people agree to it and build it themselves through their chosen paths of transition. So today we have no choice but to take very concrete action. That is what Europe is doing to effectively and universally enforce the arms embargo decided by the United Nations. That embargo is currently being violated by several Powers. The situation is not sustainable. Several Powers have also decided to continue importing fighters from the Syrian theatre, exporting terrorism to the region and disregarding the interests of Libya, its neighbours in the Sahel and Europe. Collectively, we have not sufficiently spoken out against those actions, and we must take a much harder line in the weeks to come. We are working together with all our partners in the countries neighbouring Libya to achieve a sustainable ceasefire and then to set in motion a process enabling a political resolution to the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations. That is the initiative that France wishes to undertake in the coming weeks along with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We must bring together all neighbouring countries to help reach a solution for Libya. Such renewed involvement on the part of Libya’s neighbours is vital in the long term.\\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, we must resume effective and clarified dialogue to avert a fresh area of confrontation and the undermining of international law. The Mediterranean countries of the European Union expressed themselves clearly in that respect a few days ago in Ajaccio. We respect and are prepared to engage in dialogue with Turkey, but we expect it to respect European sovereignty and international law and provide clarification concerning its activities in Libya and in Syria. Insults are ineffective. Such words and actions have no place in responsible relations among States nor can they obfuscate Europe’s call for accountability. We Europeans are ready for dialogue and for the essential construction of a Pax Mediterranea, but not through intimidation or a bullying mentality. There must be respect for international law and cooperation and respect among allies. Those principles are non-negotiable.\\nIn continental Europe, regarding the Ukrainian crisis, this year the Normandy format allowed us, along with the Federal Chancellor of Germany, to make some initial progress. But the situation in Belarus could lead to further division within our continent. The courage of the people of Belarus commands the admiration of us all. Their aspirations must be fulfilled, and we stand alongside them. I cannot stress this enough. A national political dialogue must be established and any external interference avoided. Along with the German Chancellor and the President of the European Council, we had the opportunity to hold discussions with President Putin in which we advocated for the mediation proposed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We see no other way forward. Neither interference nor guilty silence is a solution. Europe, in this area as well, will deliver with respect to its responsibility, its history and its geography. But believing in peace and stability in our region also means wanting to build a new grammar, as it were, for continental Europe, for lasting stability. That cannot be reduced to historical agreements or the dismantling of such agreements in recent years. When we speak of peace and stability, and of collective security for Europe, I cannot remain silent today about the fact that we are living in a situation where our security and stability greatly depend on agreements signed in the past between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and that such agreements have been gradually dismantled over the past decade. The end of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles marked an important step that we must not remain silent about. That is why I hope that we, as Europeans, can re-engage in a comprehensive and ambitious discussion with all our neighbours with regard to our collective security and build a new framework that takes into account the end of these historic treaties. I also want to be very clear when I say that we will not delegate our collective security to Powers other than Europe.\\nThirdly, we must protect our common goods. That is the responsibility of all, as it goes beyond our national interests and regional balances. Protecting our common goods is not at odds with the exercise of our sovereignty. On the contrary, it is the only way to truly preserve our sovereignty by maintaining control over our future. This is exactly what the crisis we face has unquestionably taught us once again.\\nDuring an epidemic, the health of one is the health of all. We have a unique opportunity to make the means for combating the pandemic into global public goods to which everyone should have access. That is the meaning behind the action we are taking under the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which we will consolidate in the coming months across all pillars, particularly with regard to improving health systems. Health, a global public good, is a battle we have been waging throughout the past year, as well as in Lyon, mobilizing the international community once again to finance the fight against historic epidemics. This is what we will continue to do and we must step up our efforts in the months ahead.\\nNow more than ever, the climate and biodiversity must be central to our collective agenda — not in words, but deeds. This December marks five years since the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We already know that the objectives we collectively set will not be achieved. The response to the pandemic can help us change course. The massive recovery plans adopted in all countries provide a historic opportunity to transform our economic and development models. That must be a core element of the European Union’s ambition, and I would like to thank the President of the European Commission for her strong commitment. It must also be a core aspect of the work of the Group of Seven and the Group of 20. It is vital. That is also why, to mark the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement, I want France to mobilize the international community anew so that each and every one of us can take stock of our commitments without changing them and without muddying the waters, but instead by transparently renewing the commitment of all of our countries and regions with revitalized determination.\\nIn the coming weeks, I am determined to see Europe reach a more ambitious agreement to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The President of the European Commission has set the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030. That means we need to move more quickly and decisively towards an ambitious emission trading scheme, a carbon price floor and a carbon border tax. These measures must be taken together. One without the others would not be as effective.\\nOn this basis and alongside our British and European partners, we will seek out the commitments of the major emitters ahead of the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we will stand by our partners, particularly in Africa, to achieve our common goals. The December meeting will be essential in that regard. In November, we will host a summit of development banks in Paris to ensure that all financial flows contribute to an environmental and inclusive recovery, in line with the Paris Agreement. On biodiversity, which we now know is clearly linked to climate change and human health, as has been demonstrated, we will be organizing a One Planet Summit in Marseilles with the United Nations and the World Bank. This One Planet Summit will enable us to build an agenda of concrete actions for protected land and marine areas, agroecology, biodiversity financing and the fight against deforestation, as well as the protection of ecosystems and species. The oceans, the poles and rainforests are part of the common heritage of humankind. It is our duty to protect them and we will do so ahead of the key events for the United Nations, including the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on climate, biodiversity and the fight against desertification. As a show of commitment, I propose that we organize a summit next year in New York, ahead of the three Conferences of the Parties, so as to generate decisive impetus and produce tangible results.\\nThe digital space is also a common good — a unique, open and trusted common good, which requires a new type of governance so that it is not captured, pirated and exploited. That is the meaning behind the initiatives that we are championing as part of the International Partnership on Information and Democracy of the Christchurch Appeal and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence. We must consolidate each of these partnerships and make progress on the Aqaba Process. In that regard, I would like to thank the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the King of Jordan for their commitment to that agenda. These are now concrete solutions, but what we need now more than simply commitments is the action of major stakeholders and platforms, as well as and a commitment on the part of all of us to legislate and to regulate in our regions if they do not honour their commitments. The fight against hatred, the fight against terrorism and the creation of a common public order on the Internet are as important as technological innovation and freedom, because there can be no freedom without public order. It is up to us to create it through international action. I do not believe that the protection of freedom of expression can tolerate the discourse of terrorism, hate speech and anonymity in a way that permits the loss of inhibitions and is a cover for the violence it spurs. This agenda is vital to us all, and we will continue to take decisive action.\\nFinally, and I say this in the context of the epidemic that I just mentioned — education is an essential common good on which we will continue to work in the coming year. Hundreds of millions of our young people have dropped out of school because of the epidemic, but education, particularly the education of young girls, continues to be a priority, especially in Africa. Alongside President Macky Sail, we have committed to the Global Partnership for Education. We have raised new funds to finance the actions of the Partnership. The role today of the World Bank, of the United Nations, of the Global Partnership for Education, of UNESCO — the role also of our bilateral actions — must be strengthened in order to act even more effectively in the months and years to come in order to improve education, especially the education of young girls. This fight is not over — far from it — and we cannot forget that. In any event, it is at the heart of France’s commitment to defending and fighting for global public goods.\\nThe fourth priority is the construction of a new era of globalization. The first era of globalization was initiated by the travels of Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan; it was that of discovery. It was also the era for the first invasions, of a kind of trial and error, of a form of fascination or sometimes of mutual misunderstandings.\\nThe second era was that of the colonial empires and the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century, where globalization was through trade, the first opening up to the outside world, but also of the slave routes, the exploitation or development of some and the enslavement of others, the first population displacements and a reconfiguration of our world in the light of these acts of domination.\\nThe third era began in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the opening of borders, the belief in the possibility that the circulation of goods and people and the subsequent generalization of the Internet would lead to convergences of interests, values and ideas.\\nI have gone through a quick presentation of history in my address to the Assembly, when each of these eras could be separated into many other periods. But, basically, it is this third era of globalization that for the past 10 years or so has been called into question. That is because there was a deep conviction — the teleology that accompanied it — that this globalization would be one of peace, a rapprochement of values and a universalization of respect for others. That has been called into question by the financial crisis, the transformations of the world, the return of peoples, the awakening of national consciences and, finally, the global pandemic. Further, it has been called into question by a deep crisis — the crisis of the Western middle classes that at one point began to doubt what this new order, called by some the happy globalization, could bring to them, given that it was these middle classes that, everywhere in the West, were often the variables in the economic, and then cultural, adjustments required for the world to be so open.\\nIt would therefore be unjustifiable in a way to deny everything that the third era of globalization has made possible, to deny everything that this period has brought in terms of prosperity. It has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty, precisely through a redistribution of world trade and production. Openness has raised awareness of travel and circulation, which has also partly improved our relations. It would be dangerous to lock ourselves into a historical stuttering where we engage in generalized protectionism by enacting customs duties and starting trade wars, falling into a kind of doubt that would lead us to the isolation or logic of power struggles. In our view, the risk is responding to this crisis of globalization with a nationalist retreat, with the violence of populism and extremism, and with the return of dominant Powers.\\nBut it is clear that global value chains need to be rethought today because the crisis has shown that dependence on such strategic sectors as health, digital technology, artificial intelligence as well as food can call into question the free exercise of sovereignty in the world as it is. We have also seen that there are good dependencies and there are dependencies that weaken us. We need to preserve international trade and openness because it is good for us economically and socially, because we cannot reinternalize everything, because this approach leads to just dependencies that require cooperation.\\nBut complete dependence on certain forces, be they technological, food-related or industrial, creates vulnerabilities that no longer allow for the kind of balances the world order requires. Furthermore, the inequalities of this new world order have become unsustainable. We have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of the extreme poverty that could be found in some countries. We have partly reduced North- South inequalities, but within some of our countries we have deepened inequalities. Furthermore, this new order makes the course of things play out in ways that are democratically unsustainable. Moreover, we have created a globalized consciousness that is today a kind of globalization, no longer of the knowledge that formed the basis of the Internet, but of feeling and resentment.\\nFor each of these crises, we must provide a response. This is the strategy that the European Union, together with other Powers, is developing. It is imperative that our international rules be adapted to take account of these new realities and provide ourselves with the means for more balanced international cooperation anchored in respect for the sovereignty of each country and for the benefit of all. In this respect, the fight against inequalities must clearly be at the heart of this reconsidered globalization. France has taken initiatives that have yielded results on women’s entrepreneurship, on the Global Partnership for Education and on health for all, in order to fight against all inequalities of fate. But we must go further.\\nIn a way, it is clear that this world in which we have lived was based on an academic consensus that gave way to a political and market consensus, which has often been called the Washington Consensus. It has run its course. Together, we must lay the foundations for a more just, more balanced, fairer and more sustainable form of globalization. We must reflect upon the terms of a globalization that accepts revisiting and rethinking the meaning of just sovereignty and fair trade, integrating the fight against inequalities in all their forms at the heart of its model, be they in terms of gender, social or economic condition, as well as the fight against global warming and in favour of biodiversity — one that allows for the sustainable integration of conditions for a new equilibrium in the world.\\nIn this regard, as well, at the Paris Forum in a few weeks’ time, we will also have to make concrete proposals, and the work undertaken with the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and many other forces for good will be essential. Along with Europe, Africa will be the driving force behind this redefinition of the terms of globalization, which is why we will continue to pursue our efforts within the framework of the initiative we established to help African countries face the pandemic at all levels — health, economic, social and humanitarian. In addition, the Group of Twenty summit in November will be a decisive meeting for the implementation of the debt moratorium that we have agreed upon and for going further. We must also improve our support for the immense energies of civil societies and the youth of the continent, which are its strength and its future. This is the underlying meaning of the initiatives we will carry out in the coming months with the diasporas and in support of the African private sector.\\nFinally, the fifth objective that I want to propose to the international community is enhancing respect for international humanitarian law and the fundamental rights of each individual. For me, this objective is essential to the very survival of the United Nations. Indeed, we have been witnessing a series of setbacks in this area and often too much silence. Since the United Nations established World Humanitarian Day, 5,000 personnel have been attacked and 1,800 have been murdered. The past year has been the deadliest yet. My thoughts go out in particular to these young French women and men who, within the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, worked in that very context, in the Niger, and were killed in atrocious conditions last August. No, the United Nations cannot sit idle in the face of such setbacks. This is why, with French non-governmental organizations and our international partners, we are building an initiative to ensure the effectiveness of international law, the protection of humanitarian personnel and the fight against impunity. The humanitarian space is a common heritage that we must protect by guaranteeing access to civilian populations and the protection of the personnel who support them. We have seen inexcusable setbacks on this subject. We have seen unacceptable practices, including on the part of permanent members of the Security Council, in Syria in particular. The neutrality of humanitarian action must be respected and its criminalization curbed.\\nTaking up our responsibilities in the humanitarian field also means showing solidarity and humanity in the area of migration. The situation at Moria, in Greece, is very difficult today. France, alongside Germany and its partners, will shoulder its responsibilities to welcome refugees, and we must all act together in the management of migratory flows so as to put an end to the trafficking of human beings, fatal crossings and routes of necessity. This will be at the heart of the European agenda for the coming weeks. I will have the opportunity to come back to it. We must step up the fight against these traffickers and live up to our responsibilities.\\nFinally, fundamental rights are not a Western idea that can be treated as interference on the part of all those who refer to them. These are the principles of our Organization, enshrined in texts that the States Members of the United Nations have freely consented to sign and to respect. That is the reason why, in particular, France has requested that an international mission, under the aegis of the United Nations, be dispatched to Xinjiang in order to take into account our collective concerns on the situation of the Uyghur Muslim minority.\\nAnd it is because we cannot tolerate the fact that, 25 years after the Beijing Conference, the rights of women throughout the world are experiencing a deep decline that we will organize next summer the Generation Equality Forum, alongside UN-Women and civil society, for the emancipation of all, the education of girls and the real and effective respect of human rights.\\nThese are the five principles on which France wants to rebuild, with Member States, the foundations of the international order so that the foundations of our Organization are not washed away by the pandemic. On the contrary, as Winston Churchill said, if you do not take change by the hand, it will take you by the throat. This requires the establishment of functional international cooperation based on clear rules, defined and respected by all. Multilateralism is not just an act of faith; it is an operational necessity. No country will emerge from this ordeal on its own. International cooperation can be difficult, but it is objectively imperative.\\nHowever, we can no longer settle for a multilateralism of words that merely serves to accept the lowest common denominator as a way of hiding deep differences under a facade of consensus. We have to change our methods, reverse the terms of the contract, raise our voices loud and clear when some people pride themselves on adhering to alliances and their principles, organizations and their principles, only to trample on them in reality. Let us be honest, clear-headed and demanding with one another. Contemporary multilateralism must also involve international organizations, private actors, businesses, non-governmental organizations, researchers and citizens so that everyone is involved in the actions undertaken. It will be built on the basis of solid, respected and verified agreements among partners in good faith, around clear objectives and rules, and with real responsibility and accountability mechanisms.\\nThis is why, at the Paris Peace Forum in November, we will strive with our European and African partners, and with all those in Asia, America and elsewhere who wish to join us, to consolidate the bases of this new international consensus, to the benefit of the future of our Organization. I do not believe in some great day of refoundation. I believe in determined, methodical, rigorous work to build a contemporary international order that will spare future generations the scourge of war, to assert human rights and equality between nations, and to promote social progress in greater freedom. That is the very promise of our Charter. It is timely. I believe in the strength of will and the value of sincerity and courage. And speaking to you at this very moment, despite the distance created by the screen, I remember the gaze of a Lebanese child I met a few days ago, who had lost everything — absolutely everything — but who had sworn to fight against all odds for what she believed in. I remember, too, the young French people murdered in the Niger because they believed in a world of humanity, solidarity and fraternity. But those I address today surely do and must have similar memories, which oblige us to act, excludes cynicism, and forbids us from losing hope or taking the easy way out. There are lives, but above all there are young girls and boys all over the world who get involved because they believe our words, because they live for and by our principles. If we betray them, it will be our fault above all if they are disillusioned or lose everything. So it is up to us. I know we can do it. In any case, wherever we are, we will do everything we can to act and I know that many of may counterparts are ready to do so as well. I count on each and every one of them. Thank you.', 'President of the General Assembly Secretary-General,\\nHeads of State and Government,\\nHeads of Delegation Ladies and Gentlemen,\\nTrust - Responsibility - Commitment\\nThese are the three pillars that influence mutual aid and cooperation among our various countries: effective multilateralism.\\nThese are the three values that are needed to safeguard this multilateralism and about which I would like to speak to you today.\\nTHE PANDEMIC MUST SERVE AS AN EYE OPENER\\nIndeed, 2020 will be recalled as a painful year. The COVID-19 pandemic took us by surprise. Each of our States faced an unprecedented crisis.\\nThe virus claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. It shattered many families around the world. Its economic impact is also considerable.\\nBut, in our minds, it has also led to uncertainty and questions about the future.\\nYet, we should not be blinded by COVID-19. On the contrary, it should open our eyes to the shortcomings that have been exposed in our models of society, for example.\\nWe must acknowledge the negative and disproportionate effects of the pandemic on those who suffer disproportionately from inequalities: women and girls, children, older persons and people with disabilities. No one should be left by the wayside.\\nNOT TO MENTION OTHER CHALLENGES\\nExcellencies,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nWhile we continue to combat the pandemic and its consequences with vigour and determination, we cannot turn our backs on the other major challenges of the twenty-first century.\\nGeopolitical tensions are palpable and conflicts are under way or loom in various corners of the globe. The health crisis only exacerbates these tensions.\\nThey threaten the fragile balance of our world.\\nThese conflicts are never inevitable.\\nFurthermore, they always have a devastating impact on populations...\\nThe situation in the Gulf, for example, remains a source of serious concern and calls for the utmost prudence.\\nThe JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) remains crucial to ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is used exclusively for peaceful purposes. We must actively preserve this agreement and the non-proliferation regime.\\nThe issue of the upcoming lifting of the conventional weapons embargo must not jeopardize the nuclear agreement and its achievements. This is a top priority for the region and its stability, international security and the global non-proliferation architecture.\\nIn the Middle East, prospects for just and lasting peace remain the goal. There can be no peace in the Middle East without a permanent and just solution to the Palestinian question.\\nNor can there be peace in the Middle East without Israel’s legitimate right to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders.\\nThere can be no peace in the Middle East without the eradication of terrorism.\\nYes, the suspension of plans to formalize the annexation of parts of the occupied Palestinian territories is a step in the right direction.\\nBut no, it is not enough. These plans must be abandoned once and for all. Annexation would seriously undermine the viability of a lasting solution and close the door to future negotiations.\\nWe welcome recent announcements about the normalization of Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. We must view this as a sign of hope that it can be a cornerstone of peace and stability in the entire region.\\nThat said, international and multilateral efforts aimed at a meaningful resumption of talks must be actively supported to enable a negotiated and viable two-State solution based on international law and United Nations resolutions.\\nThe security situation in much of the Sahel remains a matter of serious concern, despite numerous efforts and increased international mobilization.\\nFollowing a coup de force led by mutinous members of the Malian armed forces, Mali’s legal and constitutional order was challenged.\\nThe legitimate demands, aspirations and frustrations of Malian citizens, who await solutions to the many challenges facing their country, should not be met in this way. We support all regional and inter-Malian efforts to establish as soon as possible a civil transition process in Bamako that will allow a return to constitutional order.\\nMany of Mali’s challenges are common to the entire region.\\nTerrorism, conflicts between pastoralists and farmers and inter-community tensions pose severe security threats.\\nA holistic approach is needed to combat violent extremism, while underscoring good governance, the fight against impunity, the strengthening of democratic institutions, a response to the grievances of marginalized groups and sustainable and inclusive development.\\nAt the same time, an ever-increasing number of regions of the world experience the health, security and humanitarian implications of climate change and the degradation of biodiversity.\\nDrought and erratic weather conditions drive people from their homes, whether in Somalia, Yemen or Afghanistan. Melting polar ice is leading to the militarization of the Arctic.\\nThe impact of climate change underscores the social, political, economic and environmental causes of conflict.\\nThe climate emergency is a challenge to peace. There is no more time to waste.\\nThis cause must be a concern for us all.\\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and, more generally, the 2030 Agenda are essential tools for responding to the global challenges we face — be they poverty, inequality and climate and environmental degradation.\\nEFFECTIVE MULTILATERALISM AS A RESPONSE\\nExcellencies,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nIn the light of these global challenges, we must act.\\nAnd admit that we cannot do it alone.\\nNone of the common challenges I have mentioned can be addressed in isolation. None of these complex problems have simple solutions.\\nWe have no choice but to join forces, even if it means reimagining the obvious or even changing our paradigms. But always in accordance with the principles of the Charter.\\nMultilateralism does not work on the basis of its essence; it works because there is a common will to make it work.\\nIf this makes the task of those who take action difficult and the task of those who reflect easier, so be it. But let us not engage in the wrong fight.\\nIt is when its relevance is questioned that multilateralism reveals its indispensable nature.\\nToday, more than ever, we need effective multilateralism.\\nNever as an objective in itself.\\nBut always as a means to address the problems of which we are all part, in one way or another.\\nAs a means to prevent crises head-on.\\nThrough trust, responsibility and commitment.\\nTRUST\\nExcellencies,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nWhen I say trust, I mean trust in ourselves — trust in our individual and collective capacities, as demonstrated in our health-care services, to fight the pandemic.\\nTrust in our courage, resilience, knowledge and responsible behaviour, in combination with our scientific progress, to mitigate climate change.\\nTrust in our commitment to achieving sustainable development for all.\\nThe international community has already overcome major challenges and we will do so again. Resignation is not an option.\\nWhen I speak of trust, I also mean mutual trust. Such trust forces us all to keep our word. It makes us maintain constant dialogue and put ourselves in each other’s shoes.\\nWhen we do not, or no longer do so, mistrust sets in and, sooner or later, makes the necessary cooperation too difficult or even impossible.\\nWhen I say trust, I mean good governance at the national, regional and international levels in order to gain the trust of citizens.\\nGood governance built on the foundation of the rule of law, democracy, accountability and full respect for human rights.\\nWhen I say trust, I mean trust in justice — justice that must be built on the unshakeable conviction that all individuals are equal and that no form of discrimination can alter that fact.\\nRESPONSIBILITY\\nExcellencies,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nTrust, responsibility, commitment.\\nAs the United Nations, we have a responsibility to make global governance work. We contribute in various ways and at various levels, but every Member can benefit. We are the United Nations.\\nAs such, we share the responsibility for making multilateralism work and to show its added value.\\nThat is why we fully support Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ continued efforts to reform the UN.\\nReform for greater efficiency, greater transparency and greater responsiveness and adaptability.\\nWe also reaffirm our full support for peacekeeping action. This is our recognition of the need to safeguard one of the most important instruments of the international community to support political processes, protect hundreds of thousands of civilians and help enforce ceasefires.\\nMaking global governance and multilateralism work also means not hindering the functioning of its existing bodies.\\nTherefore, Belgium reaffirms its firm support for the ICC, an essential body in the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes that affect the entire international community. As an independent and impartial institution, the Court plays an indispensable role in this area. Accountability also means taking ownership of challenges so that we move from identifying them to taking action to address them. That is our responsibility to our contemporaries, but also, and above all, to our children and the next generations. That brings me to my next point — commitment.\\nCOMMITMENT / WHAT BELGIUM IS DOING\\nThe commitment to multilateralism is part of my country’s DNA.\\nPerhaps it is because it is not foreign to our history; our tradition of compromise.\\nInternational rules protect us.\\nCooperation and our close relations have strengthened us.\\nEffective multilateralism allows us to punch above our weight. In this process, we, large and small, all have a voice and added value around the table.\\nCommitment is what helped Belgium obtain its sixth mandate in the UN Security Council.\\nAs an elected Council member for 2019 and 2020, we continue to discharge our duty to advance peace and security daily.\\nIn doing so, we recognize that the Security Council is not immune to geopolitical tensions. We see an imperfect body. We see 15 States that are not always able to resolve all conflicts.\\nHowever, we also see that the majority of decisions are unanimous.\\nThe increased cooperation among the elected members is inspiring.\\nThe steps taken to discuss new security threats, such as climate change, are encouraging.\\nTransitional justice is another area in which the United Nations can demonstrate ambition — for a comprehensive human rights-based approach, the centrality of justice and accountability.\\nThese are all aspirations, which require coordination among the various national and international actors. Belgium contributes to achieving them and will continue to engage.\\nCommitment is also the driving force behind my country’s contribution to development cooperation and humanitarian aid.\\nThis is what prompted Belgium to provide multi-year support to UNRWA — making our country one of its largest donors — to improve the lives of Palestinian refugees.\\nBelgium’s commitment is also reflected in its position as one of the main European donors to Yemen.\\nWe also support UNICEF’s efforts to enable it to monitor children’s rights in conflicts.\\nBelgium’s commitment is reflected in its predictable direct multi-year funding to United Nations organizations active in the area of development. This allows for long-term action and an adequate response to the many crises.\\nThrough its constant commitment to the work and strategic objectives of UN- Women, whose tenth anniversary we mark this year, my country is working towards the systematic integration of the gender dimension in its efforts. This is a cardinal principle of our foreign policy. That is why we believe in and endorse the work of Dr. Denis Mukwege in support of women who are victims of sexual violence in eastern Congo.\\nFurthermore, our armed forces are also committed. They are commitment to the fight against the threat of terrorism and to the Global Coalition Against Da’esh.\\nThey are committed to participating in multilateral peace missions in Mali and Afghanistan, under the auspices of the UN, the European Union and NATO.\\nLastly, a strong and solid Organization must be able to rely on the resources that its sovereign Member States decide to allocate to it.\\nBelgium is committed to continuing its efforts to ensure that the UN has the necessary resources for conducting its work in time — an indispensable component of effective multilateralism.\\nCONCLUSION\\nExcellencies,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nAs we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the UN, under very special circumstances, we must not allow ourselves to be pessimistic.\\nLet us stand up. Let us face the challenges ahead and build on past achievements.\\nIn the coming weeks, we will celebrate 20 years of progress in the women and peace and security agenda and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Platform.\\nThese are multilateral achievements in the global policy framework for women’s rights. These are two concrete examples of what we can do together to improve the lives of half of the world’s population. It matters. This is a project on which there is still much progress to be made.\\nThese are but a few examples, but they matter.\\nBecause they remind us that multilateralism can work. They remind us of the many benefits of effective multilateralism.\\nLet us therefore support it.\\nWithout hesitation.\\nWith trust, responsibility and commitment.\\nThank you.', 'Mr. President! Excellencies! Ladies and Gentlemen,\\n75 years ago, the world cautiously rose from the horrors and the destruction of the Second World War. Humanity had experienced the darkest abyss of racial hate, cruelty and violence. And Austria is fully aware of its own responsibilities in this regard.\\nBut after the devastation and suffering there was also hope. Nations came together to break the endless circle of violence and despair which marked human history for centuries. The vision of a world at peace received its institutional form.\\nSince its creation, the United Nations has worked for the progress of humanity. It has made our planet safer by setting and improving global standards on human rights, rule of law, accountability, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament.\\nSince joining the UN in 1955 Austria is proud and honoured to contribute in all these areas. Whether in 60 years of Peacekeeping, or as a member — and current president — of the Human Rights Council. Austria will continue to do its part and is ready assume further responsibilities. For this particular reason, we are a candidate for the UN Security Council 2027-2028 and hope for your support.\\nLadies and Gentlemen!\\nAs any organization, the UN is not free of faults. The United Nations are often side-lined from solving conflicts. And the Security Council all too often fails to achieve consensus on how to bring peace to the world’s worst crises. But overall — if we compare today’s standards with those 75 years ago, for example on children’s education, women’s rights, child mortality, access to clean drinking water or extreme poverty and hunger, the UN can really be proud of its achievements.\\nHowever, we continue to face numerous threats, some of which would have been familiar to those meeting in 1945:\\n¥\\tdozens of armed conflicts,\\n¥\\tnearly 80 million forcibly displaced persons, as well as\\n¥\\tterrorism, political repression and extreme poverty.\\nThere are also new and emerging threats:\\n¥\\tCyber warfare and the risk of failing technological governance,\\n¥\\tbioterrorism,\\n¥\\tnew geopolitical tensions due to an increasingly polycentric\\nglobal system\\n¥\\tand climate change as the potential future super-crisis.\\nAt present, one threat, however, towers over all of them: the spread of COVID-19. It affects everyone, everywhere at the same time. The pandemic changes the way we live and the way we work.\\nJust look at this General Debate. I would have preferred to speak to you in the General Assembly Hall instead of from Austria. But at least I have the honour to address you today from the UN headquarter in Vienna. And I would have preferred to meet personally with colleagues from around the world rather than via video or telephone. The pandemic deprives us of one of the most essential tools of international relations: enriching personal encounters amongst colleagues. Thus, we have to undertake even more efforts to keep the lines of communication open!\\nMr President,\\nCOVID-19 has taught us the hard way that much we take for granted is more vulnerable than we believe.\\n¥\\tInstead of enjoying the liberty of freely moving between continents and within Europe, the pandemic forces us to grapple with travel restrictions. And we have seen only the tip of the iceberg of the pandemic’s social and economic impact. A lot of the progress on reaching the Sustainable Development Goals, which has been achieved over the past decades is endangered today.\\n¥\\tNearly 24 million children and young people will drop out or not have access to school next year due to the pandemic.\\n¥\\tCOVID-19 has triggered the most severe recession in almost a century. We see record negative numbers in economic growth, unemployment and inequality. And in international relations, the pandemic fuels the fire of existing geopolitical conflicts, while casting a shadow onto other security threats.\\nAs Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “the warning lights are flashing”. And indeed: Geopolitical trends that were present before the pandemic have gained further momentum:\\n¥\\tRe-emerging nationalism, protectionism and populism,\\n¥\\tdecreasing trust in the international system and\\n¥\\tincreasing dissemination of misinformation and “alternative facts”.\\nThe pandemic has proven again that false information can spread faster than the virus. It travels at the speed of thought. At a time when evidenced based decisionmaking is crucial, we witness an erosion of trust in experts, science and technology.\\nWhat is more: An increasing number of people see the pandemic as a clear indication that the world as a whole is developing in the wrong direction. Instinctively, they reject the advances in technology in the medical field, science, communication and business.\\nTechnological progress has jumped ahead, but it has left parts of the population behind. This growing tension between new technologies and society is a challenge for politics on the national as well as on the international level. New technologies seem partially to overburden our societies. Buzzwords such as human downgrading, cyber crime, trade in data and protection of personal data and privacy come to mind.\\nThis list would, however, be incomplete without a warning of autonomous weapons systems — machines with the power to decide, who lives and who dies. This is not science fiction, it is fast becoming a reality — a reality that the Secretary- General has rightly called both “politically unacceptable and morally repugnant”.\\nWe have to act now, before the survival of civilians in a conflict zone is determined by an algorithm and before all constraints laid down in international humanitarian law become redundant and decisions are taken by killer-robots without any human control or ethical concerns.\\nAustria will organize an international conference in Vienna next year to address this urgent issue. COVID-19 permitting, I invite all of you to participate!\\nOur call for a new digital humanism needs one further reflection: Today is the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.\\nMy speech would not be complete without a strong appeal to get rid of these weapons once and for all. They pose an existential threat to life on this planet and cause tremendous human suffering.\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nWhile the fight against COVID-19 has overshadowed everything else, the conflicts and crises around the world have not simply disappeared. Wars and humanitarian crises are not afraid of a virus! On the contrary, many of them were even aggravated by the pandemic.\\nWe must ensure that these crises are not obscured by the shadows of COVID-19.\\n¥\\tYemen is still ravaged by the worst humanitarian crisis of our time.\\n¥\\tLibya still suffers under a protracted conflict and the manifest disregard for the UN arms embargo.\\n¥\\tThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran hangs by a thread, which has led to a spiral of toughening positions.\\nFurthermore, new crises have been unfolding in the midst of the pandemic.\\n¥\\tLebanon continues on a dangerous downward slide.\\n¥\\tThe Eastern Mediterranean has seen a sharp increase in tensions due to illegal activity by Turkey that could destabilize the whole region.\\n¥\\tAnd in Belarus, the leadership has to finally accept that the genie of change is out of the bottle and cannot be forced back.\\nWe all need to stay alert and not let the headline-grabbing virus distract us. No one should believe that our focus on fighting COVID-19 constitutes a “carte blanche” for breaching international law or for a military adventure.\\nHowever, there were also rare positive signs coming from a region usually lacking in good news. Austria very much welcomes the announcement of normalisation of relations between Israel and the Emirates and Bahrain. We hope these relations will flourish and serve as examples to other countries.\\nMr. President,\\nAustria joined the United Nations 65 years ago, and in November 1956, in the first speech delivered on behalf of my country, Foreign Minister Leopold Figl said:\\n“Today the world looks to this community of nations, in which all its hopes are\\nplaced. Will it justify the confidence of the peoples of the earth and assure and\\npreserve peace and order, bread and work?”\\nIn order to justify this confidence placed in us, it is not enough to meet once a year and lament the crisis of multilateralism. And it is not enough to pay lip-service to international cooperation and the need to implement rules.\\nLet’s be honest: When the virus struck, even the most ardent multilateralists focused on keeping their public safe, closing borders, hoarding masks and equipment. And even the toughest my-state first unilateralists looked for international cooperation to secure medical supplies and assistance to overcome the social and economic crisis.\\nSo, why don’t we use this pandemic as a game-changer and simply do away with the unnecessary dispute between multilateralists and unilateralists? Let’s change that game, set and match!\\nA testing ground for this new approach could be the cooperation on COVID-19 prevention and effective treatment. Newly developed vaccines must be a global public good, accessible to all at a reasonable price!\\nYes, as politicians, it is our duty to protect our own citizens. But, the virus does not distinguish between unilateralists and multilateralists. With COVID-19 no one is safe, until everyone is safe. We, therefore, have to avoid all forms of “vaccine nationalism”. Developing a vaccine should not become a new race to the moon.\\nI am encouraged by initiatives like the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and its COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility. And I greatly value the indispensable role of the World Health Organisation.\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nThe pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of our societies and the fragility of humankind. And we all know that the next global disaster is lurking just around the corner, waiting to hit us. Be it climate change, nuclear disasters or cyber crime.\\nOur success or failure in taking decisions here at the United Nations does not take place in a vacuum. It reaches deep into our societies and the everyday lives of our citizens. This global crisis has brought home to us one clear lesson: We will succeed or fail together.\\nWe, the “people of the United Nations” need each other — and we need a strong and functioning multilateral system. Today and in the next 75 years to come.\\nThank you for your attention!', 'Mr President, Secretary-General, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, [PM] For me, the General Assembly in New York is the ultimate UN experience. All the delegations gathered in that imposing hall during the General Debate. The whole world coming together.\\nThere’s nothing like it.\\nBut this year, everything is different.\\nFor the first time in history we’re having a virtual Assembly.\\nIt feels a bit surreal, and it’s far from ideal, but it’s important — despite the restrictions — that we share our views on the international situation.\\nEspecially this year.\\nBecause this is the year of coronavirus.\\nThe impact on our health, our economies and our societies has been enormous.\\nAlmost every country in the world, including the European and Caribbean parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, has been hit hard.\\nThe poorest countries hardest of all.\\nExisting problems have been magnified by the pandemic.\\nAnd this has forced us to face facts: in times of crisis we have to work together.\\nLook out for each other.\\nSupport one another.\\nNot only our families, neighbours and compatriots, but also other countries and peoples, regardless of the borders between us.\\nBecause we’re all in this together.\\nThe UN is setting the right example.\\nNot least by setting up the UN COVID-19 Response and\\nRecovery Fund, initiated by Secretary-General Guterres.\\nThe Netherlands fully supports the Fund, and so far we’re its biggest donor.\\nThe World Bank and the IMF are also helping the countries most affected.\\nThese are fine examples of international solidarity that bode well for the future.\\nBut if we’re truly going to defeat this virus we’ll have to do even more to enhance international cooperation.\\nIt starts with supporting the World Health Organization, which plays a crucial role.\\nWe must provide the resources it needs.\\nIt also means countries need to give the Organization full cooperation and show transparency.\\nIn some cases this has been lacking.\\nAt the same time, the WHO has also attracted criticism.\\nThe Netherlands agrees that — once the crisis is under control — we should evaluate the situation and look at how we can enhance its powers.\\nSo that we’re well-equipped to deal with — or better still prevent — any future pandemic.\\nCritical evaluation and continuous efforts to improve are key elements of multilateral cooperation.\\nBut unfortunately, as we mark the UN’s 75th anniversary, we’re also seeing another trend.\\nThe multilateral world order, which has given us so much in the decades since World War Two, is under great pressure.\\nAnd we need to turn this tide.\\nStep one is for all countries to take responsibility for the proper functioning of the multilateral system.\\nTake a constructive approach.\\nStand up for your own interests, but don’t lose sight of the common interest.\\nAnd last but not least, honour the agreements we’ve made and respect international law, including human rights.\\nWhen it comes to multilateralism, you can’t pick and choose.\\nStep two is to critically assess the system itself.\\nBecause there’s work to be done there too.\\nWe can’t tackle today’s challenges with yesterday’s structures.\\nIt’s essential that we improve, reform and modernise our global institutions.\\nAnd the UN is no exception.\\nDuring our recent membership of the UN Security Council, the Netherlands worked hard on practical UN reforms in the area of peacekeeping.\\nAnd we fully support the broad reform agenda of SecretaryGeneral Guterres.\\nTogether we need to ensure that the UN — now 75 years old — remains fit for purpose, well-equipped and young at heart.\\nThat it’s ready for the next 75 years.\\nBecause the new generations, who are already making their voices heard, must be able to count on a solid global system of multilateral cooperation.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands will keep working towards that end, in every way possible.\\nBy providing financial resources, for example: we are one of the ten biggest donors to the multilateral system and we try to play a constructive role.\\nBut also by sharing our expertise in areas like climate adaptation.\\nA topic that’s in the very DNA of our Kingdom, which is made up of a low- lying delta by the North Sea and several small islands in the Caribbean.\\nIn January 2021, we will be hosting the Climate Adaptation Summit to help the world prepare better for the effects of climate change.\\nAnother contribution we make is providing a base for the international legal order.\\nMy home town of The Hague is host to the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, for example.\\nWe must continue supporting these crucial institutions.\\nEven though it’s become harder and harder in recent years to achieve accountability, due mainly to resistance from a small number of countries.\\nBut we won’t let that stop us.\\nWe will find other ways.\\nLike the international mechanism for collecting and analysing evidence of the most serious crimes committed in Syria.\\nOr the step the Netherlands recently took, holding Syria formally responsible for human rights violations.\\nAnd for our country in particular, the establishment of special court proceedings to try those accused of downing flight MH17 was a major milestone.\\nBecause justice must be served.\\nAnd because justice is a central pillar of our multilateral world order.\\nWe work in all these areas, in the full conviction that international cooperation brings us progress.\\nAnd although the current crisis forces us to keep our distance, now more than ever we need to come closer together.\\nThank you.', 'Mr President,\\nExcellencies,\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\n“The survivors were immune, the others dead.”\\nThis is the rather pithy description of the end of the Spanish flu one hundred years ago by a German medical historian.\\nSo pithy in fact that we recoil when we consider the pandemic that has a firm grip on our world today.\\nThirty million people have already been infected by coronavirus.\\nAlmost one million people have died.\\nAnd its longer-term impacts — hunger, poverty, displacement and conflicts — are beginning to reach us only now.\\nAnd yet 2020 isn’t 1920.\\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself — at least, if we don’t allow it to.\\nWe have a choice, ladies and gentlemen, and few things illustrate this more clearly than the experiences that we have made during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nOn the one hand, they show that a lack of transparency, coupled with disinformation and conspiracy theories, can kill.\\nOn the other, they point to a path out of the crisis.\\nIt is the path of reason that is founded on scientific expertise.\\nThe path of cooperation that is based on common rules.\\nRules all of us have to abide by. And that is why I’m speaking to you today from quarantine at my home, having come into contact a few days ago with someone who tested positive for the virus.\\nAnd I hope that the technology works and that you can understand what I’m saying nonetheless.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nAs long as the virus is out there, it can affect each and every one of us.\\nThat is why only when we get the pandemic under control throughout the world will we be able to overcome it in the long term.\\nThose affected by it must be at the centre of all of our efforts. And the search for vaccines and medicines must not be a competition or a beauty contest.\\nThis is why Germany has set aside more than three billion euro this year for global crisis management — with a particular focus on the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\\nAnd, as the biggest exporter of pharmaceutical products, we have expressed a clear commitment to distributing potential vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 in a fair way — as a global public good.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nThis crisis also shows that international cooperation is neither an ideology nor an end in itself.\\nOn the contrary, it delivers results.\\nFar beyond the actual pandemic.\\nSuch as in Ukraine, where the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have helped to bring about the longest ceasefire since the beginning of the conflict.\\nHundreds of thousands of people in the east of the country are currently no longer living under the permanent spectre of war. This is grounds for hope for a genuinely permanent solution to the conflict.\\nWe will take this hope as the basis for intensive engagement in the Normandy format in the coming months, including at high-ranking political level.\\nIn Libya, too, we are focusing on cooperation with the United Nations in order to implement the decisions of the January Berlin Conference to the letter.\\nThe rapprochement between the government in Tripoli and the forces in the east of the country that has taken place in recent weeks is a major step forward. However, forces outside the country must also fall into line at long last in order to achieve a solution. They must cease sending weapons and mercenaries, thus exacerbating the conflict.\\nThis is what we will aim to achieve when Antonio Guterres and I gather together the supporters of the Berlin Process once again in early October in order to make them honour their commitments.\\nThe latest developments in relations between Israel and the Arab countries in the Gulf are likewise grounds for hope — this is also the result of courageous cooperation.\\nI have been in close dialogue with my counterparts from Jordan, Egypt and France in recent weeks, and we agreed that this new dynamic should be seized by the parties for fresh, credible negotiations on a two-state solution that alone holds the promise of lasting peace. For this, both sides must make compromises and refrain from violence, but also from unilateral steps such as annexation and settlement construction. Wherever we Europeans are able to support this — politically or economically — we will do so.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nDespite all the progress made in recent weeks, we’re still a very long way from a new global attitude. The Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire, which was adopted in the Security Council under Germany’s Presidency in July, is falling on deaf ears in many places.\\nThis is not only a problem as far as credibility of the Security Council is concerned.\\nIt is, first and foremost, a disaster for millions of people in war and crisis areas who are utterly defenceless in the face of the pandemic.\\n•We need still greater efforts in the fight against violence and terrorism in the Sahel, and above all closer dialogue between the countries of the region, regional organisations and the international community.\\nThis is what the Sahel Alliance, the Partnership for Security and Stability in the Sahel and the International Coalition for the Sahel are seeking to achieve.\\nAnd we’re supporting the efforts made by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to help Mali return to a constitutional order as swiftly as possible — as peace, stability and development are what the people there are calling for.\\nFurthermore, ladies and gentlemen, a new, international effort is also needed in order to bring peace to Syria at long last.\\nA nationwide ceasefire and a comprehensive, genuine constitutional process, as envisaged by Resolution 2254 (2015), are prerequisites before we can talk about reconstruction of the country.\\nAnd until that time, we stand firmly by the side of the Syrian people — with humanitarian assistance, which must continue to be provided across borders.\\nThere’s another thing that is necessary for lasting peace, namely justice.\\nThis is why we will continue to ensure that those responsible for the worst crimes against humanity — for murder, torture and rape — are held to account before German courts and why we will support the UN mechanisms for investigating these crimes with all our might.\\nThis is by no means just about Syria, however. Those who don’t clearly distinguish between perpetrators and victims, who blur the line between right and wrong, shake the very foundations of our rules-based order. Such people jeopardise our peaceful coexistence itself.\\nThis applies to those who stand in the way of the work of institutions such as the International Criminal Court.\\nThis applies to those who block the Security Council with one veto after another and who prevent its urgently needed reform with constantly new delay tactics.\\nAnd this especially applies to those who contravene international law, although, as permanent members of the Security Council, they bear particular responsibility for upholding it.\\nThis isn’t the first time that we have been confronted by a violation of an existential principle of international cooperation, namely the banning of chemical weapons.\\nA violation of this — as we have been able to prove together with our partners in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny — is a problem for the entire international community.\\nI call on Russia to do more to investigate this case. A case such as this must have consequences. The EU therefore reserves the right to impose sanctions.\\nAnd we’re grateful to our partners around the world fortheir unequivocal support.\\nWe need this same determination, this same will to cooperate also with respect to other existential issues facing humanity.\\nHere, once again, we have a choice.\\nWe can continue to watch as our forests burn — and yet still deny the existence of human-induced climate change.\\nOr we can listen to the voice of scientists and treat climate change as what it is, namely the biggest threat to security, prosperity and development on our planet.\\nThis is also why we have firmly enshrined the issue of climate and security on the Security Council’s agenda in recent months.\\nAnd we’re delighted that Norway, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico and others will continue to work on this when they are members of the Security Council next year.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nWe can continue to violate arms control treaties — thereby destroying trust that has been built up over many decades.\\nOr we can put nuclear disarmament and non proliferation back on the international agenda — as we have done in recent months, not least with a view to the upcoming Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\\nEurope’s efforts to promote the nuclear agreement with Iran must also be seen in this context.\\nYes, we share the concerns about the end of the arms embargo as long as Iran threatens Israel and destabilises the entire region from Lebanon to Syria to Yemen.\\nHowever, the destruction of the JCPOA doesn’t get us any closer to an arms embargo. On the contrary, at best, the JCPOA’s demise brings Iran closer to getting the atomic bomb.\\nAnd this is why we, as JCPOA participants, continue to stand by its full applicability and call on Iran to likewise fully comply with the agreement.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nWe can watch human rights being hollowed out and trampled underfoot, even though all of us have committed to uphold them.\\nOr we can stand by the side of those who are suppressed, abused and persecuted — such as the peaceful protesters in Belarus.\\nWe have called on Lukashenko time and again to support a national dialogue, mediated by the OSCE. However, he has rejected all offers and is continuing to tread the path of violence and suppression.\\nAnd this must also have consequences if we are serious about our values and our international agreements. We’re discussing this in the European Union.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nCourageous decisions are needed especially in times of crisis.\\nSeventy-five years ago — following the devastation of the Second World War that was unleashed by Germany — the international community decided:\\nTo oppose war and to promote international cooperation.\\nAnd to oppose the law of the strong and to promote the strength of the law.\\nAnd so the United Nations was born. Thirty years ago — after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain — this decision was underpinned by the Charter of Paris. The Charter proclaimed that the “era of confrontation and division of Europe” had ended and that a “new era of democracy, peace and unity” had begun.\\nToday, in the midst of the pandemic, it is our generation that faces a choice.\\nEither we go it alone, without taking others into consideration, and throw this multilateral legacy to the winds.\\nOr we renew this legacy and show that the right response to the crises of our age is “more solidarity” — “more cooperation” and “more justice”.\\nGermany is prepared to do just this.\\nTogether with you — as genuinely united nations.\\nThank you very much — and stay healthy!', 'Mr President of the General Assembly,\\nMr Secretary-General,\\nDistinguished Heads of State and government,\\nExcellencies,\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nThere are moments that leave their mark for generations. The founding of the United Nations seventy-five years ago was one such moment. For this, we can be grateful to our parents.\\nAre we nevertheless permitted to take a critical look at the UN today? — Yes, we are... We even have to.\\nIn fact, seventy-five years on and there are still wars, there are more refugees and displaced people than ever before, there is a climate crisis currently without a solution, millions are going hungry and we haven’t achieved gender equality.\\nWe could criticise the UN for this — but who are we really talking about, when we blame “the UN”? We are in fact talking about ourselves, because the UN is its Member States. And it is often Member States that stand in the way of the UN’s work. They block decisions or refuse to implement them, undermine resolutions or flout their principles.\\nThis weakens the UN. And it weakens all of us, too. If we want a strong UN, then we — Member States — must strongly support the organisation and work together to pursue its objectives. Because the goals of the UN are our goals.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nWe live in an era marked by geopolitical tensions. Many States are also increasingly polarised in their internal affairs.\\nMore than ever, the UN is indispensable for the promotion of peace and security in the world. It embodies the causes of human rights, sustainable development and a world governed by the rule of law. We would do well to work together to achieve the goals of the UN because they benefit all of us and they make us stronger.\\nMy country is proud to contribute to the achievement of the UN’s goals, even if it is not always easy. It is difficult to translate the goals we have set ourselves - on climate or gender equality for example - into national policy. But that is why all of us politicians are elected: to offer our respective populations and humanity as a whole a decent life in freedom and security.\\nMy country also advocates for an international order regulated by the rule of law. We are committed to international humanitarian law and to the prevention of conflicts, and we provide good offices wherever they are desired. My country is prepared to take on more responsibilities, which is why for the first time, Switzerland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2023-2024.\\nSwitzerland of course wholeheartedly supports the Secretary General’s appeal for a global ceasefire. But beyond such an appeal, is there anything else we can do?\\nWe must put even more effort into preventing conflicts. Here too, human rights must remain at the centre of our action. “International Geneva” also contributes to conflict prevention, for example by hosting the Human Rights Council and the Arms Trade Treaty Secretariat.\\nBy prosecuting the worst crimes, the International Criminal Court is contributing to uphold international humanitarian law. We reaffirm here our support for the International Criminal Court as an integral part of a rules-based international order. To facilitate debate on the best ways to adhere to these humanitarian norms, Switzerland was one of the first countries to publish a voluntary report on its national implementation. My country would welcome it if other countries followed.\\nWhile it is right to try to prevent conflicts and to seek to mitigate their worst humanitarian consequences, it is also crucial to find lasting solutions to the conflicts that are ongoing. As the capital of peace, “International Geneva” contributes to this by providing a space for dialogue between the parties to a conflict.\\nSwitzerland’s peace policy draws on essential characteristics of my country’s political culture, such as power-sharing, openness to dialogue, tolerance and consideration of everyone’s interests. In the future, Switzerland intends to further step up its capacities and expertise in mediation and facilitation in order to support those who wish to end conflicts through dialogue.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nWhile “International Geneva” contributes to peace and security in the world, it is also the seat of the World Health Organization, which has played such a crucial role since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nThe current health crisis has caused untold suffering in the world. The most vulnerable have been hit hardest: the child in the overcrowded displacement camp; the single mother who has lost her job; the young adult whose job prospects have been destroyed; or elderly people and the sick, who are particularly at risk.\\nMy country is coping with this pandemic as best it can.\\nThe World Health Organization plays a central part in fighting the pandemic. As host state of the WHO and other international health organisations, Switzerland is committed to ensuring that they can take effective action. For this to happen, the WHO must have sufficient resources and the support of all of us to carry out its reforms. Is it fair to demand so much from this organisation when 80% of its funding comes from voluntary contributions?\\nBeyond the necessary fight against the current pandemic, we must think now about the world that will emerge from this crisis and that cannot entirely be yesterday’s. If every crisis is a suffering, it is also a moment of change that allows us to reinvent ourselves.\\nSo let’s reinvent ourselves, keeping in mind the goals we set for ourselves when the UN was created seventy-five years ago.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nThere are moments that leave their mark for generations. Such moments require decisive and courageous action. This is true today. From my country’s perspective, the most urgent tasks are to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, and to step up our efforts for peace.\\nIt is up to us — the political representatives of our countries — to take the right decisions for the good of our fellow human beings and our planet. Let us assume this responsibility.\\nLet us strengthen the UN’s capacity to act, and ensure that the decisions we make today will be a source of pride for generations of tomorrow.']\n"
